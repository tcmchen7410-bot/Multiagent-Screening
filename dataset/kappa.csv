#23,Treatment of epigastralgia by external application of huweigao at shenque point,"140 cases of epigastralgia were divided into two groups at random. The 100 cases in the treatment group were treated with Huweigao externally applied at Shenque (Ren 8), and the 40 cases in the control group by oral administration of Weinaian capsule. After a one-month treatment, the total symptom-relieving rate and the gastroscopy-proved effective rate were 94.0% and 52.6% respectively in the treatment group, much superior to those in the control group.",No,No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No
#30,Acupuncture in Women with Human Polycystic Ovary/Ovarian Syndrome: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial,"(1) Background: Human polycystic ovary/ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is linked to endocrine, metabolic, and psychological complications. We propose a randomized controlled pilot study for an acupuncture protocol regarding the management of PCOS symptoms based on TCM diagnosis; (2) Methods: We will randomly allocate 120 women diagnosed with PCOS into two groups. The study group will be treated with acupuncture for points known to act upon the autonomous regulation of the hormonal, metabolic and emotional components. (3) Results and Conclusions: We expect to provide evidence of high methodological quality related to the effects and safety of an acupuncture protocol based on the perspective of a TCM diagnostic.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#35,Irritable bowel syndrome: a mild disorder; purely symptomatic treatment,"(1) Patients frequently complain of occasional bowel movement disorders, associated with abdominal pain or discomfort, but they are rarely due to an underlying organ involvement. Even when patients have recurrent symptoms, serious disorders are no more frequent in these patients than in the general population, unless other manifestations, anaemia, or an inflammatory syndrome is also present; (2) There is currently no way of radically modifying the natural course of recurrent irritable bowel syndrome; (3) The effects of antispasmodics on abdominal pain have been tested in about 20 randomised controlled trials. Pinaverium and peppermint essential oil have the best-documented efficacy and only moderate adverse effects. Antispasmodics with marked atropinic effects do not have a favourable risk-benefit balance; (4) Tricylic antidepressants seem to have only modest analgesic effects in this setting. In contrast, their adverse effects are frequent and they have somewhat negative risk-benefit balances. Nor has the efficacy of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants (SSRIs) been demonstrated; (5) Alosetron and tegaserod carry a risk of potentially life-threatening adverse effects and therefore have negative risk-benefit balances; (6) Seeds of plants such as psyllium and ispaghul, as well as raw apples and pears, have a limited impact on constipation and pain. Osmotic laxatives are effective on constipation. Symptomatic treatments for constipation can sometimes aggravate abdominal discomfort; (7) Loperamide has been poorly assessed in patients with recurrent irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhoea. It modestly slows bowel movement but does not relieve pain or abdominal discomfort; (8) Dietary measures have not been tested in comparative trials. Some patients are convinced that certain foods provoke a recurrence of irritable bowel syndrome, but restrictive diets carry a risk of nutritional deficiencies; (9) Various techniques intended to control emotional and psychological disturbances have been proposed, including relaxation, biofeedback, hypnosis, and psychotherapy. The results of clinical trials are not convincing; (10) Oral products containing live bacteria, designed to change the equilibrium of intestinal flora, have been tested in 13 placebo-controlled trials, with inconsistent results. A few cases of septicaemia have been reported; (11) The six available trials of acupuncture (versus sham acupuncture) showed no more than a placebo effect; (12) In practice, patients who have recurrent irritable bowel syndrome but with no other signs of a condition warranting specific treatment should be reassured as to the harmless nature of their disorder if a careful physical examination and basic laboratory tests are negative. The only available treatments have purely symptomatic effects and only limited efficacy. It is best to avoid using all treatments and additional diagnostic investigations that carry a risk of disproportionate adverse effects.",Yes,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#41,Electrocortical Analysis of Patients with Intercostobrachial Pain Treated with TENS after Breast Cancer Surgery,"[Purpose] Among the physical therapeutic procedures to decrease pain, there is transcutaneous electrical neural stimulation (TENS). There is no consensus about its efficacy for oncological patients, especially for post-mastectomy pain and eletrocortical changes in somatosensory areas. The aim of this study was to analyze acute electrocortical changes after TENS treatment of patients with intercostobrachial post mastectomy pain. [Subjects] Eighteen patients were divided into acupuncture (A) and burst (B) group. [Methods] In this pre and post-intervention study each group was measured for EEG analysis in absulte power in alpha band (8-14 Hz). Outcomes variables were the alpha waveband in the sensorymotor cortex and pain pre-and-post TENS intervention. Data were analyzed using ANOVA to compare times (rest, 10 and 15 min), group and electrodes. Pain was analyzed using percentual pain evaluation (PPE) in both groups. [Results] Outcomes indicate main effects of time and electrodes because of slow (8-10 Hz) and fast alpha (10-12 Hz) wavebands decreased. PPE reduced 88.4% in A and 66.3% in G. [Conclusion] TENS promoted electrical modification in the parietal region and a decrease in pain. Future studies should investigate other wave must be proposed for other bands and use different methods of EEG analysis to elucidate the actual mechanisms behind the efficacy of TENS treatment.",No,No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No

#79,Effect of acupuncture on gut microbiota in participants with subjective cognitive decline,"A close relationship has recently been described between subjective cognitive decline (SCD) and gut microbiota disorders. Herein, we aim to investigate the effect of electroacupuncture (EA) on gut microbiota in participants with SCD.We conducted a study of 60 participants with SCD. Sixty participants were allocated to either EA group (n = 30) or sham acupuncture group (n = 30). Both groups received 24 sessions of real acupuncture treatment or identical treatment sessions using the placebo needle. Global cognitive change based on a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery was evaluated to detect the clinical efficacy of acupuncture treatment at the baseline and the end of treatment. Faecal microbial analyses were carried out after collecting stools at T0 and T12 weeks. Microbiomes were analyzed by 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing. Correlation analyses were performed to investigate the relationships between the changes in gut microbiota and symptom improvement.Age is a particularly important factor leading to the severity of dementia. Compared with sham acupuncture group, the number of Escherichia-Shigella in EA group decreased after treatment. The number of Escherichia-Shigella in EA group decreased after treatment compared with EA group before treatment. Bifidobacterium is positively correlated with clinical efficacy Z-score and Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale (both P < .005).Acupuncture could improve global cognitive change among SCD participants by regulating the intestinal flora. Dysbiosis was found in the gut microbiome in SCD and partially relieved by acupuncture. Our study suggests that gut microbiota could be a potential therapeutic target and diagnostic biomarker for SCD.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes
#86,Importance of modes of acupuncture in the treatment of chronic nociceptive low back pain,"A controlled study of different modes of acupuncture stimulation was conducted on patients fulfilling clinical criteria for chronic low back pain of nociceptive origin. Forty patients were randomly entered into the study. Thirty had three trial treatments with manual stimulation of needles (MS), electrical low frequency stimulation at 2 Hz (LF), and high-frequency stimulation at 80 Hz (HF), and then continued treatment with the mode they felt most benefitted them. Ten patients were put on the waiting list for treatment but served as the untreated control group. The results were evaluated after 6 weeks and at 6 months for: activity related to pain; mobility; verbal descriptors of pain and the patient's subjective assessment of his condition. After 6 weeks, patients receiving treatment showed significant improvement (P < 0.05 to P < 0.001) on three of the four measures compared to the untreated controls. After 6 months a similar measure of significant improvement was seen in patients continuing with low-frequency (LF) acupuncture, but not in those groups continuing with manual stimulation (MS) or high-frequency (HF) acupuncture. The results suggest that 2 Hz electrical stimulation is the mode of choice when using acupuncture in the treatment of chronic nociceptive low back pain.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No
#102,Meta-analytic review of the efficacy of smoking cessation interventions,"A meta-analysis of randomized and controlled evaluations of the efficacy of smoking cessation interventions compared 146 estimates of the difference in abstinence rates between treated and control conditions (effect sizes) from 85 publications. Simple advice to quit and other brief intervention techniques, nicotine chewing gum and behavioural techniques were all found to be significantly better than relevant control conditions in promoting abstinence, although the results were not homogeneous. In five studies of acupuncture compared with control, consistent results were found showing no benefit for acupuncture.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#103,A model of clinical pain. Technique for evaluation of analgesic agents,"A method is described utilizing repetitive electrical stimulation for the production of long-term continuous pain which approaches the quality of clinical pain. This technique provides for on-line monitoring of actual power delivered to the subject. Incremental stimuli of high and low intensities were randomly superimposed on continuous painful background electrical stimulation. Subjects were studied in a triple crossover design with acupuncture, codeine and baseline treatments. Data were evaluated by Sensory Decision Theory (SDT) procedures. The codeine compound significantly raised the response criterion to higher intensity stimuli but did not effect perception of low intensity stimuli, indicating an analgesic but not an anesthetic effect. No significant differences were found between control and acupuncture results for either pain discriminability or pain report criterion. The results are discussed with regard to the physiological effects of electrical stimulation and the merits of this new stimulation technique.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#118,Alternative treatments for adults with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),"A previous review of alternative treatments (Tx) of ADHD--those other than psychoactive medication and behavioral/psychosocial Tx--was supplemented with an additional literature search focused on adults with ADHD. Twenty-four alternative Tx were identified, ranging in scientific documentation from discrediting controlled studies through mere hypotheses to positive controlled double-blind clinical trials. Many of them are applicable only to a specific subgroup. Although oligoantigenic (few-foods) diets have convincing double-blind evidence of efficacy for a properly selected subgroup of children, they do not appear promising for adults. Enzyme-potentiated desensitization, relaxation/EMG biofeedback, and deleading also have controlled evidence of efficacy. Iron supplementation, magnesium supplementation, Chinese herbals, EEG biofeedback, massage, meditation, mirror feedback, channel-specific perceptual training, and vestibular stimulation all have promising prospective pilot data, many of these tests reasonably controlled. Single-vitamin megadosage has some intriguing pilot trial data. Zinc supplementation is hypothetically supported by systematic case-control data, but no systematic clinical trial. Laser acupuncture has promising unpublished pilot data and may be more applicable to adults than children. Essential fatty acid supplementation has promising systematic case-control data, but clinical trials are equivocal. RDA vitamin supplementation, non-Chinese herbals, homeopathic remedies, and antifungal therapy have no systematic data in ADHD. Megadose multivitamin combinations are probably ineffective for most patients and are possibly dangerous. Simple sugar restriction seems ineffective. Amino acid supplementation is mildly effective in the short term, but not beyond 2-3 months. Thyroid treatment is effective in the presence of documented thyroid abnormality. Some alternative Tx of ADHD are effective or probably effective, but mainly for certain patients. In some cases, they are the Tx of choice, and initial evaluation should consider the relevant etiologies. A few have failed to prove effective in controlled trials. Most need research to determine whether they are effective and/or to define the applicable subgroup. Some of them, although not safer than standard Tx, may be preferable for an etiologic subgroup.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#131,Effect of P6 acupressure on postoperative vomiting in children undergoing outpatient strabismus correction,"A prospective, double-blind study was conducted to compare the effect of pressure at the P6 (Neikuan) point with placebo as an antiemetic in children. Sixty-six patients, ages 3-12 yr, undergoing outpatient surgery for correction of strabismus, were allocated randomly to receive either bilateral P6 acupressure or placebo during the perioperative period. The study was designed to detect a 50% difference in the incidence of postoperative vomiting between the two groups, with a 90% power of achieving a statistically significant result at the 5% level (two-tailed). The incidence of postoperative vomiting for the placebo group was 58% before discharge from hospital, 73% at home and 82% in the first 24 h after surgery. The corresponding results for the acupressure group were 58% before discharge, 71% at home and 94% in the first 24 h. These differences were not significant; P6 acupressure did not reduce the incidence of postoperative vomiting in children undergoing strabismus surgery.",No,No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No

#141,Lumbar epidural injections in the treatment of sciatica,"A randomized trial of lumbar epidural injections for the treatment of acute sciatic pain was carried out. All the patients had unilateral sciatica for less than six months and had never previously been treated in hospital for their backs. The treatments used were 20 ml normal saline, 80 mg Depomedrone in normal saline made up to 20 ml, 20 ml, 20 ml 0.25% bupivacaine solution and needling with a standard Touhy injection needle into the interspinous ligament but with no injection. The patients improved at about the same rate for all four treatments. Overall, 75% of the patients improved or were cured. As some of these were in the group treated by needling of the interspinous ligament, it seems likely that the epidural injections administered achieved effects partially as a placebo and partially by virtue of the natural history of the acute sciatic syndrome.",No,No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No
#153,Unraveling the variability and geoclimatic drivers of daily precipitation concentration over a Western Himalayan Province of India,"A sound understanding of daily precipitation concentration provides critical insights about extreme precipitation and associated hazards such as rainstorms, flash floods, cloud bursts, and soil erosion. Therefore, this study examines the spatiotemporal variability and geoclimatic drivers of daily precipitation concentration using the concentration index (CI), precipitation concentration degree (PCD), Q Index (QI), and Theil index (TI) over a Western Himalayan Province, namely Himachal Pradesh, India. For this, the daily precipitation data pertaining to 111 grids (0.25° × 0.25° resolution), encompassing entire province, have been downloaded from India Meteorological Department (IMD), Pune, for the period 1951 to 2020. The trends in concentration indices have been detected using Mann-Kendall (MK) and Sen's slope methods, whereas their relationship with geoclimatic drivers have been assessed using Pearson's correlation coefficient (physiographic) and random forest regression model (climatic) at annual and monsoon season time scales. The results have revealed a high correlation between CI-TI (> 0.95), followed by QI-TI (> 0.84), QI-PCD (> 0.80), TI-PCD (> 0.78), QI-CI (> 0.65), and CI-PCD (> 0.60), representing nearly similar precipitation concentration distribution. Among the concentration indices, QI has shown maximum sensitivity to long-term changes followed by TI, CI, and PCD at both time scales. Similarly, physiographic factors have maximum effect on QI, showing its greatest sensitivity to latitude, longitude and elevation. While considering the impact of climatic drivers, Atlantic Meridian Oscillation (AMO) and Sunspot activity have exerted maximum influence on annual variability of CI, PCD, QI, and TI, whereas monsoon variability of these indices has been modulated by Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), especially over northern parts of Himachal Pradesh. These findings will assist soil and water resource managers, disaster executives, agricultural stakeholders, and urban planners in understanding the unexplored aspects of daily precipitation concentration and making informed decisions over the mountainous regions of western Himalaya.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#164,Perceptions of interprofessional education and practice within a complementary and alternative medicine institution,"A survey of the constituents of a complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) institution was conducted to identify perceptions of interprofessional education (IPE) and practice (IPP). A 22 question survey was developed and administered to: chiropractic students, acupuncture and oriental medicine students, faculty and alumni of both professions, staff and administrators. The majority of the 321 respondents demonstrated positive perceptions of IPE and IPP, however many reported a lack of understanding of the distinct roles of select healthcare professions. The study also suggested that the campus community is not homogenous in its understanding of CAM or allopathic professions, or is it homogenous in its understanding of IPE and IPP. While the overall positive attitudes toward IPE and IPP imply a willingness to improve collaboration between these groups, the lack of understanding of profession-specific roles must be addressed to support effective implementation of IPE.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#166,A systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials on physical interventions for lateral epicondylalgia,"A systematic review of the literature on the effectiveness of physical interventions for lateral epicondylalgia (tennis elbow) was carried out. Seventy six randomised controlled trials were identified, 28 of which satisfied the minimum criteria for meta-analysis. The evidence suggests that extracorporeal shock wave therapy is not beneficial in the treatment of tennis elbow. There is a lack of evidence for the long term benefit of physical interventions in general. However, further research with long term follow up into manipulation and exercise as treatments is indicated.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#181,Complementary and alternative medicine approaches to blood pressure reduction: An evidence-based review,"ABSTRACTOBJECTIVETo review the evidence supporting complementary and alternative medicine approaches used in the treatment of hypertension.QUALITY OF EVIDENCEMEDLINE and EMBASE were searched from January 1966 to May 2008 combining the key words hypertension or blood pressure with acupuncture, chocolate, cocoa, coenzyme Q10, ubiquinone, melatonin, vitamin D, meditation, and stress reduction. Clinical trials, prospective studies, and relevant references were included.MAIN MESSAGEEvidence from systematic reviews supports the blood pressure-lowering effects of coenzyme Q10, polyphenol-rich dark chocolate, Qigong, slow breathing, and transcendental meditation. Vitamin D deficiency is associated with hypertension and cardiovascular risk; supplementation lowered blood pressure in 2 trials. Acupuncture reduced blood pressure in 3 trials; in 1 of these it was no better than an invasive placebo. Melatonin was effective in 2 small trials, but caution is warranted in patients taking pharmacotherapy.CONCLUSIONSeveral complementary and alternative medicine therapies can be considered as part of an evidence-based approach to the treatment of hypertension. The potential benefit of these interventions warrants further research using cardiovascular outcomes.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#207,The effectiveness of acupressure on relieving pain: a systematic review,"Acupressure is a complementary treatment that uses fingers and hands to stimulate acupoints and maintains the balance of energy. The objective of this study was to review the application of acupressure in managing different pains and the effectiveness of acupressure on relieving pain in various settings. A systematic review of English articles using the databases of MEDLINE, PubMed, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) was performed using the search terms of ""acupressure"" and ""pain."" Studies during which acupressure was applied as an intervention and assessed for its effectiveness on relieving pain were selected. The studies selected were those published from January 1, 1996 to December 31, 2011 that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The participants included patients with dysmenorrhea, labor pain, low back pain, chronic headache, and other traumatic pains. The Oxford 2011 Levels of Evidence was used to appraise the literature. Fifteen studies were extracted for reducing dysmenorrhea (menstrual distress), labor pain, low back pain, chronic headache, and other traumatic pain. These papers were further reviewed for their study design, adequacy of randomization and concealment of allocation, blinding of participants, interventions, and outcome measurements. Acupressure has been shown to be effective for relieving a variety of pains in different populations. The review begins to establish a credible evidence base for the use of acupressure in pain relief. The implication for health care providers would be incorporating acupressure into their practice as an alternative therapy to facilitate patients who suffer from pain.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#208,Acupressure reduces agitated behaviour in people with dementia,Acupressure is a kind of massage that originates in China. The treatment involves the stimulation of certain acupoints by pressing with the fingers or slowly moving limbs or joints. Previous studies have shown that this treatment shows subjective evidence of improved cognition and reduced agitated behaviour in people with dementia. The aim of this study was to see if objective measures of improvement could be made. Participants received four weeks of acupressure treatment and control groups had the same period of visits and conversation. Acupressure was carried out twice daily and took 15 minutes. The acupressure group showed a significant decline in agitated and aggressive behaviour.,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No
#214,Two Distinct Neural Mechanisms Underlying Acupuncture Analgesia,"Acupuncture analgesia is a traditional treatment with a long history, although it lacks scientific evidence. It is reportedly associated with the central nervous system, including various brain regions, from the cortices to the brain stem. However, it remains unclear whether the distributed regions behave as a single unit or consist of multiple sub-units playing different roles. Magnetoencephalography is a neuroimaging technique that can measure the oscillatory frequency of neural signals and brain regions. The frequency band of neural signals allows further understanding of the characteristics of the acupuncture-related neural systems. This study measured resting-state brain activity using magnetoencephalography in 21 individuals with chronic pain before and after acupuncture treatment. The subjective level of pain was assessed using a visual analog scale, and brain activity was compared to identify the brain regions and the frequencies associated with acupuncture analgesia. Here, we categorized the changes in resting-state brain activity into two groups: low-frequency oscillatory activity (<3 Hz) in the left middle occipital and right superior partial lobule and high-frequency oscillatory activity (81-120 Hz) on both sides of the prefrontal, primary sensory, and right fusiform gyri. These findings suggest that acupuncture analgesia influences two or more sub-units of the neural systems, which helps us understand the neural mechanisms underlying acupuncture analgesia.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No
#216,Acupuncture/acupressure for weight reduction? A systematic review,"Acupuncture and acupressure are often advocated and used as a means of controlling appetite and reducing body weight, supported by case-series and uncontrolled studies that show encouraging results. This paper reviews placebo/sham-controlled clinical trials published on this topic. Two independent literature searches identified four such studies. None of these is without significant methodological flaws and their results are contradictory. The two relatively rigorous trials show no effect on body weight. On balance, no clear picture emerges to show that acupuncture/acupressure is effective in reducing appetite or body weight. Claims that these forms of treatment have specific effects on these conditions are therefore not based on well-performed clinical trials.",Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#225,Genome-Wide Regulation of Acupuncture and Moxibustion on Ulcerative Colitis Rats,"Acupuncture and moxibustion have definite clinical effects on treating ulcerative colitis (UC), but their mechanism is still unclear. To investigate the molecular mechanisms, we applied herb-partitioned moxibustion or electroacupuncture at the Tianshu (ST25) points on UC rats and used RNA sequencing to identify molecular consequences. Male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were divided into 6 groups randomly: the normal control (NC) group, the control + herb-partitioned moxibustion (NCHM) group, the control + electroacupuncture (NCEA) group, the model (UC) group, the model + herb-partitioned moxibustion (UCHM) group, and the model + electroacupuncture (UCEA) group. Compared to the UC group, HE staining in the UCHM group and UCEA group indicated that colitis was relieved, the histopathological score and MPO were both significantly reduced, and the serum hs-CRP concentration was decreased significantly. The results of RNA-seq suggested that, compared to the NC group, 206 upregulated genes and 167 downregulated genes were identified in colon tissues from the UC group; compared to the UC group, the expression levels of some genes were both affected in the UCHM group and the UCEA group (684 differentially expressed genes were identified in the UCHM group, and 1182 differentially expressed genes were identified in the UCEA group). KEGG signal pathway analysis indicated that the differentially expressed genes in the UCHM group were associated with the JAK-STAT signaling pathway and cell adhesion molecule (CAM); the differentially expressed genes in the UCEA group were associated with the NF-κB signaling pathway, the toll-like receptor signaling pathways, the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, the MAPK signaling pathway, and the Wnt signaling pathway. This is the first study to reveal the gene expression characteristics of the anti-inflammatory effect of UC rats from the perspective of acupuncture and moxibustion control, which provide a clue for further investigation into the molecular mechanisms of UC treatment by acupuncture and moxibustion.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#228,Effect of Acupuncture on Timeliness of Male Shoulder Joint Endurance,"Acupuncture as a traditional and commonly used treatment has been used to improve the performance of athletes. In the improvement of female shoulder joint explosive force and muscle endurance also has an immediate effect. However, whether the effect of acupuncture therapy can be maintained after improving athletic performance still worth further discussion. The purpose of this study was to explore the timeless of the physical neurophysiological response induced by acupuncture at specific acupoints in improving endurance performance. Seventeen healthy male participants completed six groups of shoulder joint isokinetic exercises. The isokinetic exercise completed in the first group was taken as the baseline. After acupuncture for 15 min, the following 5 isokinetic experiments were completed. Acupuncture acupoints included Binao (LI14), Jianliao (SJ14), Naohui (SJ13), Zhongfu (LU1), Xiabai (LU4), Tianfu (LU3) and Xiaoluo (SJ12). The results show that acupuncture can improve physical performance for 10-20 min. After acupuncture, the maximum torque, average power, average work and total work values significantly increased (p < 0.05). Stimulation of acupoints can effectively improve the performance of periarticular muscle endurance around the shoulder, but this improvement is limited by time.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No
#258,Spotlight on acupuncture in laboratory animal medicine,"Acupuncture has been practiced for thousands of years, although it is only in the past century that science has worked to unravel the mechanisms behind its use. Literature supporting the efficacious use of acupuncture to treat a variety of conditions has been and continues to be published, including the randomized controlled studies we all appreciate when practicing evidence-based medicine. The use of acupuncture in veterinary medicine has paralleled the trends observed in people, with an increasingly common use to remedy specific medical conditions. These conditions are commonly related to neurological dysfunction or orthopedic pain. Although pain relief is the most common use of acupuncture, numerous other conditions have been shown to improve with this therapy. Laboratory animals are also benefiting from acupuncture. Its use is starting to be incorporated into research settings, although there is still further progress to be made in this field. Acupuncture has been shown to improve clinical conditions and quality of life in laboratory animals, and should be considered as a tool to treat laboratory animals with conditions known to benefit from therapy. Here we review the history, mechanisms of action, and use of acupuncture to treat veterinary patients and laboratory animals.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#263,Effects of electroacupuncture on intraoperative and postoperative analgesic requirement,"Acupuncture has been shown to be effective in experimental and clinical acute pain settings. This study aims to evaluate the effect of preoperative electroacupuncture (EA) on intraoperative and postoperative analgesic (alfentanil and morphine) requirement in patients scheduled for gynaecologic lower abdominal surgery. Ninety patients were randomly assigned to one of three groups: Group I (control group)--received placebo EA for 45 minutes before induction of general anaesthesia (GA); Group II--preoperative EA instituted 45 minutes before induction of GA; Group III--45 minutes of postoperative EA. The Bispectral Index monitor was used intraoperatively to monitor the hypnotic effect of anaesthetic drugs, and alfentanil was titrated to maintain the blood pressure and pulse rate within +/- 15% of basal values. Postoperative pain was managed by intravenous morphine via a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) device. Patients in Group II (0.44 +/- .15microg/kg/min) received less alfentanil than those in Group III (0.58 +/- .22 microg/kg/min) (p = p.024), but not significantly less than those in Group I 10.51 +/- 0.21 microg/kg/min) (p = 0.472). Postoperative morphine consumption was numerically lower in Group II compared with the other groups; however, the difference was statistically significant only during the period of 6-12 hours between Group II [0.03 (0.05) mg/kg] and Group I [0.10 (0.11) mg/kg] (p = 0.015), and Group II and Group III [0.08 (0.10) mg/kg] (p = 0.010). The 24-hour cumulative morphine consumption for Group II (0.52 +/- .19mg/kg) was less than that for either Group I I0.68 +/- 38mg/kg) or Group III (0.58 +/- .27mg/kg), but the difference did not reach significance. In conclusion, preoperative EA leads to a reduced intraoperative alfentanil consumption, though this effect may not be specific, and has a morphine sparing effect during the early postoperative period.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes
#284,Clinical Study on the Application of Acupuncture in the Postoperative Rehabilitation of Dogs Affected by Acute Thoracolumbar Disc Herniation,"Acupuncture has been widely incorporated into rehabilitation protocols for dogs and cats because of its potential analgesic efficacy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential positive effect of integrating acupuncture and electroacupuncture techniques on the recovery of ambulation capacity in non-ambulating paraparetic patients undergoing physiotherapy in the postoperative period following mini-/hemilaminectomy for thoracolumbar spinal cord decompression due to acute disc extrusion. Forty-one patients were included and underwent descriptive and analytical statistical analysis, divided into two groups: dogs that received a physiotherapy protocol with acupuncture and dogs that received physiotherapy only. The results showed that the dogs in the acupuncture group had a higher likelihood of regaining ambulation.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,No,No
#298,Effects of Electroacupuncture on Facial Nerve Function and HSV-1 DNA Quantity in HSV-1 Induced Facial Nerve Palsy Mice,"Acupuncture is a common and effective therapeutic method to treat facial nerve palsy (FNP). However, its underlying mechanism remains unclear. This study was aimed to investigate the effects of electroacupuncture on symptoms and content of HSV-1 DNA in FNP mice. Mice were randomized into four groups, an electroacupuncture treatment group, saline group, model animal group, and blank control group. Electroacupuncture was applied at Jiache (ST6) and Hegu (LI4) in electroacupuncture group once daily for 14 days, while electroacupuncture was not applied in model animal group. In electroacupuncture group, mice recovered more rapidly and HSV-1 DNA content also decreased more rapidly, compared with model animal group.

#309,[Acupuncture in pain therapy: current concepts],"Acupuncture is a technique that was originally developed in ancient Chinese culture. One of the most important areas of use is in pain treatment. Many scientific publications have tried to prove the efficacy of acupuncture and have tried to determine the possible mechanisms of action. It has been shown that stimulation by acupuncture, mechanically or electrically, stimulates certain endocrine control mechanisms, which cause the release of morphine like substances. These endocrine controls are not only stimulated by acupuncture, but also are activated by other pain fighting techniques that utilize peripheral stimulation. Even if experimental studies could prove the effects of acupuncture, it is still difficult for scientists to accept the Chinese theory. Until now, nobody could determine the exact nature of the points and circles of acupuncture. The precise location of the points does not seem to be a requirement for the analgesic effects. The analysis of referred pain made it possible to confirm the anatomical and functional bases of acupuncture points and circles. Many authors have found good external agreement between points of pain and acupuncture points and have found agreement between the Chinese circles and radicular and pseudoradicular pain areas. With respect to the interpretation of the results of controlled clinical studies, it was difficult to determine the criteria for placebo. The criteria used depends on which acupuncture model is used. In the traditional model, any use of the needle at a different point from the Chinese point is called placebo. In the neurophysiological model, it seems that the method of stimulation, mechanical or electrical, makes the difference. This hypothesis has been confirmed by analysing all past clinical studies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Yes,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#312,EEG EPs analysis of magnetic stimulation on acupoint of Shenmen(HT7),"Acupuncture is a useful irritation therapy clinically. Acupuncture at acupoints is proved to have specific function on human body. Magnetic stimulation is a new kind of stimulating technique of non-invasive, painless and effective. The effect of magnetic stimulation on acupoint is a new subject in recent years. In this paper, the electroencephalogram (EEG) evoked potentials (EPs) of magnetic stimulation by stimulating the acupoint of Shenmen(HT7) are studied. The experiments are divided into four groups: quiet, acupoint stimulation, mock stimulation and mock point stimulation. The EEG EPs are collected and an obvious P150 component is obtained. The amplitudes of P150s are analyzed and compared. The P150s are localized in brain by dipole model and the coronal, sagittal and axial plans are painted and observed. The results show that acupoint stimulation on acupoint of Shenmen(HT7) can evoke stronger nerve activity of somatosensory than stimulation on common surface. The dipole source of acupoint stimulation and common surface stimulation are both focused on the cingulated gyrus which related to somatosensory.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#352,Use of IMMPACT domains in clinical trials of acupuncture for chronic pain: A methodological survey,"Acupuncture is one of the therapeutic resources used for the management of chronic pain. Variability in outcome measurements in randomized clinical trials of non-oncologic chronic pain (RCT-NOCP) generates inconsistencies in determining effects of treatments. The objective of this survey was to assess the adherence to the recommendations made by the Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials (IMMPACT) in the measurement of RCT-NOCP of acupuncture. This methodological research made a systematic search for eligible studies from different sources of information. Eligible studies included those with number of patients ≥100, who randomized and allocated patients with chronic non-oncologic pain to be treated with acupuncture or with ""sham"" acupuncture, or non-acupuncture. This research included the recommendations for IMMPACT in the measurement of RCT-NOCP: presence of outcomes pain, physical function, emotional state and improvement perception of patient, the source of the outcome information pain and the tools used to measure such domains. From a total of 1,386 studies, 24 were included in this survey. Eleven studies presented low risk of bias. Pain outcome was measured in 23 studies, physical function in 22 studies, emotional state in 14 studies and improvement perception of patient in one study. As for the pain outcome, the patient was the information source in 50% of the studies. The measurement tools recommended for IMMPACT were included in eight studies (35%) that evaluated pain, one study that evaluated the emotional state (7%), and one study that evaluated the improvement perception and satisfaction of patient. It was observed that studies which did not adhere to the recommendations had more favorable results for acupuncture in the outcome pain. This study concludes that randomized clinical trials that used acupuncture to manage chronic pain failed to adhere to IMMPACT recommendations. Clinical societies and IMMPACT do not share the same recommendations. This fact reflects in the diversity of outcomes and instruments adopted in the studies, making it difficult to compare the results.",No,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#383,Electroacupuncture Alleviates Hyperalgesia by Regulating CB1 Receptor of Spinal Cord in Incisional Neck Pain Rats,"Acupuncture therapy is effective in relieving postoperative pain of neck surgery, but its underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. This study, in the incisional neck pain rat model, was designed to explore whether the endocannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) in the cervical spinal cord is involved in the analgesic effect of electroacupuncture (EA) or not.The incisional neck pain model was established by making a longitudinal incision and applied EA treatment of Futu (LI18), Hegu-Neiguan (LI4-PC6), or Zusanli-Yanglingquan (ST36-GB34) for pain relief. The results showed that EA LI18 and EA LI4-PC6 effectively relieve allodynia caused by neck incision, which was obviously better than EA ST34-GB34 (P < 0.05). After EA, the expression levels of CB1 mRNA at 4h in the EALI18 group, and 24 and 48h in both EALI18 and EALI4-PC6 groups, and those of CB1 protein at 4, 24, and 48h in the EALI18 group, and the immunoactivity of CB1 in both EALI18 and EALI4-PC6 groups at 4h were significantly upregulated in contrast to those of the model group (P < 0.05). EA of either acupoint group had no effect on the expression of CB2 protein (P > 0.05). Moreover, the antinociceptive effect of EA was reversed by AM251 (CB1 antagonist). Immunofluorescence dual staining showed that CB1 expressed in astrocytes in the superficial layer (laminae I and II) of dorsal horns of the cervical spinal cord. Therefore, the findings of this study revealed that upregulation of CB1 expression in the cervical spinal cord contributes to the analgesic effect of EA in incisional neck pain rats. The CB1 receptor expresses on astrocytes.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#389,Standards for reporting interventions in controlled trials of acupuncture: The STRICTA recommendations. STandards for Reporting Interventions in Controlled Trails of Acupuncture,"Acupuncture treatment and control group interventions in parallel-group randomised trials of acupuncture are not always precisely reported. In an attempt to improve standards, an international group of experienced acupuncturists and researchers devised a set of recommendations, designating them STRICTA: STandards for Reporting Interventions in Controlled Trials of Acupuncture. In a further consensus-building round, the editors of several journals helped redraft the recommendations. These follow the Consolidated Standards for Reporting Trials (CONSORT) format, acting as an extension of the CONSORT guidelines for the specific requirements of acupuncture studies. Participating journal editors are publishing the STRICTA recommendations and requesting prospective authors to adhere to them when preparing reports for publication. Other journals are invited to adopt these recommendations. The intended outcome is that interventions in controlled trials of acupuncture will be more adequately reported, thereby facilitating an improvement in critical appraisal, analysis and replication of trials.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#399,More than DeQi: Spatial Patterns of Acupuncture-Induced Bodily Sensations,"Acupuncture uses needles to stimulate certain parts of the body, inducing a specific sensation, termed DeQi, which regard as essential for acupuncture's therapeutic effect. Here, we used the newly developed tool, bodily sensation mapping, to investigate the spatial configuration of acupuncture-induced sensations throughout the body. Twenty-five participants randomly received acupuncture stimulation or tactile stimulation using a von Frey filament at four different acupoints (HT7, PC6, ST36, and SP10) on the left side of the body. Subjects evaluated the characteristics of DeQi sensations and marked the areas of induced sensations on a body outline. We compared the psychophysical responses of DeQi sensations and visualized the spatial patterns of these sensations using statistical parametric mapping. We found greater intensity of DeQi sensations following acupuncture stimulation compared with tactile stimulation, with relatively small differences among the four acupoints. The sensation maps exhibited similar spatial patterns for acupuncture and tactile stimulation in the areas close to the stimulated sites. However, acupuncture was associated with additional sensations in areas remote from the stimulated sites. This study demonstrates that acupuncture stimulation produces greater DeQi sensations than tactile stimulation and results in the spreading of sensations to areas remote from the stimulus sites. Investigating the spatial patterns of acupuncture-induced sensations may be crucial for understanding the underlying mechanisms of acupuncture.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes
#417,Alterations in electrical pain thresholds by use of acupuncture-like transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation in pain-free subjects,"Acupuncture-like transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (ALTENS) was compared with a placebo treatment in altering acute electrical pain thresholds. Ten pain-free subjects underwent, on different days, an acclimatization session, an ALTENS treatment, and a placebo treatment in a cross-over design. Electrical sensation and pain thresholds were measured from the tip of the index finger bilaterally at 15-minute intervals twice before, once during, and three times after a 30-minute treatment session. The ALTENS treatment was given at 4 Hz at an intensity just below pain threshold delivered to acupuncture points in the hand and wrist. The placebo treatment was similarly delivered, except that the intensity of stimulation was just above sensation threshold. Neither the ALTENS treatment nor the placebo treatment produced a significant change in pain threshold. There was no correlation between initial pain threshold and change in pain threshold. Implications for the modulation of pain are discussed.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#461,Acupuncture in post-date pregnancy: a pilot study,"AIM: Pharmacological labor induction is obtained through intracervical/vaginal prostaglandins and/or oxytocin infusion; however, the use of these agents produces fetal and maternal side effects. Traditional Chinese medicine advocates the use of acupuncture to soften the cervix and induce uterine contractions. The aim of the present study is to investigate the effect of acupuncture to induce labor. Acupuncture was applied in post-date pregnancies one week before a planned induction; the primary outcome was the rate of women submitted to labor induction for prolonged pregnancy at week 41 + 5. METHODS: After informed consent, 221 undelivered women ranging between 40 + 2/40 + 6 gestational age were considered eligible for the study and 202 were randomized to receive acupuncture or observation. Sessions of acupuncture were planned every odd day from the randomization till 41a week plus 4 days. At 41 + 5 week a pharmacological induction of labor was planned. RESULTS: The total rate of labor induction did not significantly differ between observation and acupuncture group (20% versus 17%). Moreover no differences were found as far as the indications to induce labor, in particular ""prolonged pregnancy"" was similar between groups (8/96 versus 5/99). To investigate between-group differences in time elapsed between inclusion and delivery, survival analysis was performed excluding women requiring labor induction: women receiving acupuncture showed a trend to deliver earlier than women in the observation group (p < 0.09). CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrated that acupuncture applied every odd day for one week seems ineffective in reducing the rate of labor induction performed for prolonged pregnancy at 41 + 5 weeks. Previous reports reached similar conclusions, independently of the different timing, duration and mode of stimuli application.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes
#474,[Randomised trial of acupuncture compared with conventional massage and "sham" laser acupuncture for treatment of chronic neck pain - range of motion analysis],"AIM: The aim of this study was to compare the effects of acupuncture on active motion of the cervical spine in patients with chronic neck pain with those of ""sham"" laser acupuncture and massage. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 177 patients with chronic neck pain were included in this prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled study. The patients were allocated by external randomization to five treatments over three weeks with acupuncture, massage and ""sham"" laser acupuncture. The range of active motion was measured by means of a 3D ultrasound real time motion analyzer. RESULTS: The analysis of cervical motion in three directions showed the largest increase in range of motion 14 days after acupuncture. Compared to massage, a significant improvement in total range of motion was seen in those patients treated by acupuncture immediately (p = 0,03) and one week (p = 0,03) weeks after therapy. There was no significant difference in those patients treated by sham laser acupuncture. CONCLUSION: The results of the study indicate that acupuncture is superior to conventional massage for improving active range of motion in patients with chronic neck pain. Because of its positive effects, its acceptance among patients and the lack of severe side effects, acupuncture can be recommended for the treatment of chronic neck pain, although there was no significant difference in results between ""sham"" laser acupuncture and acupuncture.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No
#478,Effects of transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation on ovarian reserve of patients with diminished ovarian reserve in in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer cycles,"AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation (TEAS) on ovarian reserve in patients with diminished ovarian reserve undergoing in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 240 patients were randomly divided into the Han's acupoint nerve stimulator TEAS treatment (TES), comforting false Han's placebo (FHP), artificial endometrial cycle treatment (AEC), and control (CON) groups. RESULTS: Fifty-six patients in TES, 56 in FHP, 54 in AEC, and 60 in CON fulfilled the study, respectively. Antral follicle count and anti-Müllerian hormone levels were increased, whereas the estradiol level, follicle-stimulating hormone level, and follicle-stimulating hormone/luteinizing hormone ratio were significantly decreased after treatment in the TES and AEC groups. After treatment, the number of oocytes retrieved and average number of embryos transferred were higher in the TES and AEC than in the CON and FHP groups. Clinical pregnancy rate in the TES group was markedly higher than values obtained for the other three groups. CONCLUSION: TEAS and AEC treatments could improve basal endocrine levels in patients, and increase the number of oocytes retrieved and high-quality embryos. TEAS treatment could improve the clinical pregnancy rate in patients with decreased ovarian reserve during in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer cycles.",No,No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No
#479,[Electromyographic changes in bruxism after auricular stimulation. A randomized controlled clinical trial],"AIM: The aim of this study was to verify in bruxism patients the possible efficacy of auricular stimulation in reducing the hypertonicity of some masticatory muscles. METHODS: Forty-three bruxism patients were randomly allocated to 3 groups: acupuncture, needle contact for 10 seconds, no treatment (control). Helkimo's clinical dysfunction index (CDI) and anamnestic dysfunction index (ADI) were used to assess the functional state of the masticatory system. The resting electrical activity of the anterior temporalis (AT), masseter (MM), digastric (DA) and sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscles was measured, according to Jankelson, with surface electrodes at baseline, after stimulation and continually for 30 minutes (120 measurements in total). The electromyographical variations in the 3 groups were studied with t test for independent samples. RESULTS: Acupuncture and needle contact were superior to control in reducing the muscle hypertonicity of all muscles except SCM. In the comparison between acupuncture and needle contact the former showed better results only for the right TA and left DA (p = 0.000). CONCLUSION: In this study it was possible to measure the efficacy of the stimulation of only one point or area, which is an ideal model for research in acupuncture. The auricular area we chose for stimulation was never used before for the purpose of relaxing masticatory muscles. Acupuncture and needle contact for 10 seconds showed similar effects.",No,No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No
#485,The effect of the combination of dry needling and MET on latent trigger point upper trapezius in females,"AIM: The purpose of this clinical trial experiment was to compare the effects of the combination of dry needling (DN) and the muscle energy technique (MET) on the upper trapezius latent myofascial trigger point. METHOD: Sixty female patients, aged 18-30 with latent myofascial trigger points in the upper trapezius muscle were randomly divided into three groups: group 1 (n = 20) received DN and MET, group 2 (n = 20) received only MET, and group 3 (n = 20) received only DN. The visual analogue scale (VAS), pressure pain threshold (PPT), and range of active contra lateral flexion (CLF) were measured before each treatment. The patients were treated for three sessions in a one-week period with at least a two-day break between each session, and in session four, an assessment of primary outcomes was conducted without any treatment. RESULTS: All three treatment groups showed decreases in pain (p = 0.001) and increases in PPT levels (p = 0.001) as well as increases in CLF (p = 0.001). But the group receiving trigger point DN together with MET showed more significant improvement than the other two groups in VAS, PPT and ROM. No significant differences were found between the MET-only group and the DN-only group. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that all three treatments used in this study were effective for treating MTP. According to this study, DN and MET is suggested as a new method for the treatment of MTP.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes

#489,Effects of acupressure at the Sanyinjiao point on primary dysmenorrhoea,"AIM: This paper presents the findings of a study that assessed the effects of acupressure at the Sanyinjiao point on symptoms of primary dysmenorrhoea among adolescent girls. BACKGROUND: Dysmenorrhoea is the most common gynaecological disorder among adolescents. Traditional Chinese acupressure derived from acupuncture is a non-invasive technique. Despite renewed interest in the use of acupressure, relatively few studies have been undertaken to examine its effects on primary dysmenorrhoea. METHODS: An experimental study was conducted between December 2000 and August 2001. Participants were female students attending a technical college in Taiwan. None of the 69 participants had a prior history of gynaecological disease or secondary dysmenorrhoea, and all were rated higher than five for pain on a visual analogue scale from 0 to 10. The experimental group (n = 35) received acupressure at Sanyinjiao (above the ankle) while the control group (n = 34) rested for 20 min, while the control group underwent rest in the school health centre for 20 min without receiving acupressure. Fifty participants (30 experimental, 20 control) completed the 4-6-week follow-up session. Five instruments were used to collect pretest and post-test data at each session: (1) Visual Analogue Scale for pain; (2) the Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire; (3) the Menstrual Distress Questionnaire; (4) the Visual Analogue Scale for anxiety; and, for the experimental group only, (5) the Acupressure Self-Assessment Form. Data were analysed using the chi-square test, two-sample t-test and repeated measures two-way anova. RESULTS: Acupressure at Sanyinjiao during the initial session reduced the pain and anxiety typical of dysmenorrhoea. In the self-treatment follow-up session, acupressure at Sanyinjiao significantly reduced menstrual pain but not anxiety. Thirty-one (87%) of the 35 experimental participants reported that acupressure was helpful, and 33 (94%) were satisfied with acupressure in terms of its providing pain relief and psychological support during dysmenorrhoea. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that acupressure at Sanyinjiao can be an effective, cost-free intervention for reducing pain and anxiety during dysmenorrhoea, and we recommend its use for self-care of primary dysmenorrhoea.",No,No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No
#491,"The effects of acupressure on pain, anxiety and vital signs in patients undergoing coronary angiography: A randomized and sham-controlled trial","AIM: This randomised sham-controlled trial aimed to analyse the effects of acupressure on pain, anxiety, and vital signs in patients who underwent coronary angiography. MATERIALS AND METHODS: After undergoing coronary angiography, 105 patients were randomised into acupressure (n = 35), sham acupressure (n = 35), and control groups (n = 35). Patients in the acupressure group received acupressure on the heart meridian 7 (HT7), large intestine meridian 4 (LI4), and pericardium meridian (PC6) acupoints 30 min after admission to the clinic, for a period of 16 min, whereas those in the sham group received acupressure on locations 1-1.5 cm away from these points. The control group received standard treatment. The patient information form, Spielberger's state anxiety inventory, visual analogue scale, and vital signs follow-up form were used for data collection. FINDINGS: Consecutive measurements revealed that anxiety levels in the acupressure group were lower than that in the sham and control groups (p < 0.05). In addition, compared to the sham and control groups, the pain scores in the acupressure group decreased significantly after acupressure (p < 0.01). Although there was no significant difference between the pain scores of the sham group before and after acupressure intervention (p > 0.05), the scores of the control group increased significantly over time (p < 0.01). Finally, the vital signs decreased significantly in the acupressure and sham groups after intervention (p < 0.01), but increased significantly in the control group (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: The findings of this trial indicated that acupressure is an effective method for reducing anxiety, pain, and vital signs.",No,No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No
#520,A systematic review investigating the effectiveness of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) for the management of low back and/or pelvic pain (LBPP) in pregnancy,"AIM: To evaluate and summarize the current evidence on the effectiveness of complementary and alternative medicine for the management of low back pain and/or pelvic pain in pregnancy. BACKGROUND: International research demonstrates that 25-30% of women use complementary and alternative medicine to manage low back and pelvic pain in pregnancy without robust evidence demonstrating its effectiveness. DESIGN: A systematic review of randomized controlled trials to determine the effectiveness of complementary and alternative medicine for low back and/or pelvic pain in pregnancy. DATA SOURCES: Cochrane library (1898-2013), PubMed (1996-2013), MEDLINE (1946-2013), AMED (1985-2013), Embase (1974-2013), Cinahl (1937-2013), Index to Thesis (1716-2013) and Ethos (1914-2013). REVIEW METHODS: Selected studies were written in English, randomized controlled trials, a group 1 or 2 therapy and reported pain reduction as an outcome measure. Study quality was reviewed using Risk of Bias and evidence strength the Cochrane Grading of Recommendations and Development Evaluation Tool. RESULTS: Eight studies were selected for full review. Two acupuncture studies with low risk of bias showed both clinically important changes and statistically significant results. There was evidence of effectiveness for osteopathy and chiropractic. However, osteopathy and chiropractic studies scored high for risk of bias. Strength of the evidence across studies was very low. CONCLUSION: There is limited evidence supporting the use of general CAM for managing pregnancy-related low back and/or pelvic pain. However, the restricted availability of high-quality studies, combined with the very low evidence strength, makes it impossible to make evidence-based recommendations for practice.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#522,'Van Herick Plus': a modified grading scheme for the assessment of peripheral anterior chamber depth and angle,"AIM: To evaluate the accuracy of a new, modified grading scheme involving a short vertical slit beam, at the inferior angle for peripheral anterior chamber depth (PAC) and angle estimation and its correlation with anterior segment optical coherence tomography (ASOCT). METHODS: A cross-sectional study of consecutive phakic patients, above 40 years of age, was performed. Using a short, vertical slit beam not reaching the pupil, the inferior angle at the sclerolimbal junction was evaluated, photographed and assessed by a ratio of peripheral anterior chamber depth to peripheral corneal thickness (PAC:PCT) and iridocorneal angle (ICA) on ImageJ software. The inferior angle at the same meridian was also recorded on ASOCT. RESULTS: Based on the PAC:PCT ratio, the subjects were divided into four groups: I (<1/4), II (1/4-1/2), III (>1/2-1) and IV (>1). The clinically assessed angle by short vertical slit beam correlated well with ASOCT values, trabecular-iris angle (TIA) (r=0.918; p<0.001) and scleral spur angle (r=0.903, p<0.001). The mean difference between ICA and TIA on ASOCT was 0.797(0); 95% limits of agreement:-5.767(0) to 7.361(0) (±1.96 SD). For angles graded narrow on ASOCT (TIA <20(0)), using a cut-off of peripheral PAC:PCT <1/4, the area under the curve was 0.918 with a sensitivity of 85.2% and a specificity of 88.2%. There was good agreement between ImageJ parameters with those assessed subjectively on photograph of the slit beam examination by a glaucoma fellow (weighted kappa=0.74) as compared with a general ophthalmologist, where there was moderate agreement (weighted kappa=0.57). CONCLUSION: A short, vertical slit lamp beam evaluation at the inferior angle is an easy and relatively accurate method for both peripheral anterior chamber depth and angle assessment. It correlated well with ASOCT and can be used as a more reliable screening tool to identify eyes with possibly occludable angles.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#529,"Holistic acupuncture approach to idiopathic refractory nausea, abdominal pain and bloating","AIM: To evaluate the effectiveness of a holistic acupuncture approach on nausea, pain, bloating and electrogastrogram (EGG) parameters in patients with intractable symptoms. METHODS: Twelve patients with no or mild nausea (those without nausea had bloating or pain) and 10 with a history of moderate to severe nausea were referred for acupuncture. All underwent an EGG and were treated at acupuncture points PC6, SP4 and DU20. Visual analog scales (VAS) assessing severity of nausea, pain and bloating were obtained before and after acupuncture treatment. Nineteen patients received three and three patients received two treatments. RESULTS: VAS scores for nausea reflected the clinical assessment and differed significantly between mild and moderate/severe nausea groups. Acupuncture significantly improved severity of nausea in both groups with improved pre-treatment nausea between the first and third treatments in the moderate/severe nausea group. Pain scores improved with acupuncture in the mild nausea group only and bloating improved only with the first treatment in this group. Patients with bloating with VAS scores greater than 35 pre-treatment improved with acupuncture and over all VAS scores for pain improved with treatment. Acupuncture increased the power in the 2.7 to 3.5 cpm range in the EGG. CONCLUSION: In this uncontrolled clinical study, a holistic acupuncture approach significantly improved nausea in patients with refractory symptoms and increased the power in the 2.7-3.5 cpm component of the electrogastrogram. Bloating and pain VAS scores improved acutely with treatment. This study suggests that acupuncture may be effective in this refractory group of patients and further study using appropriate controls is warranted.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#534,[Real-world migraine burden: clinical and economic aspects],"AIM: To evaluate the rationale for different approaches to preventive chronic migraine (CM) treatment by comparing clinical outcomes and financial burden of the disease in the real-world practice. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sixty-six patients with CM were enrolled at the Alexander Vein Headache Clinic (60 women and 6 men, aged 28-51). All patients were divided into 3 groups: group 1 (n=22) received oral preventative treatment with topiramate, up to 100 mg daily, for three months; group 2 (n=20) received 12 acupuncture sessions (3 sessions a week); group 3 (n=24) received 155-195 units of botulinum toxin type A (botox, BTA). The follow-up period in all groups was 3 months. Efficacy was evaluated by clinical examination, the Headache Impact Test (HIT-6) and questionnaires to assess subjective patient satisfaction and treatment tolerability. RESULTS: BTA demonstrated the highest efficacy in this study. Compared to the oral preventative treatment and acupuncture, BTA reduced the frequency of headache faster and more significantly facilitating CM transformation into episodic migraine (headache frequency was 16.1±0.1; 18.0±0.02; and 13.9±0.3 in groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively, after one month of treatment). BTA also improved the quality of life faster and more significantly and was better tolerated (good - 51%, 75% and 85% in groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively; satisfactory - 35%, 25% and 15% in groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively; bad 14% in the oral prevention group). In the BTA group, the majority of patients demonstrated earlier treatment satisfaction. Despite higher (compared to topiramate) direct costs in the BTA group (RUB 29 931.51 and RUB 32 085.87, respectively), the predicted cost of a headache-free day was the smallest and totaled RUB 652.15 (compared to RUB 692.86 and RUB 1017.60 in the topiramate and acupuncture groups, respectively). CONCLUSION: The data on the efficacy and costs of different CM prevention strategies would facilitate optimal treatment choice for neurologists and patients.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes

METHODS: Eighty children with anisometropic monocular amblyopia were randomly divided into two groups: control (40 cases, 1 case of shedding) and acupuncture (40 cases, 1 case of shedding) groups. The control group was treated with glasses, red flash, grating, and visual stimulations, with each procedure conducted for 5min per time. Based on routine treatment, the acupuncture group underwent acupuncture of ""regulating qi and unblocking meridians to bright eyes"", Jingming (BL1), Cuanzhu (BL2), Guangming (GB37), Fengchi (GB20) acupoints were taken on both sides, with the needle kept for 30min each time. Both groups were treated once every other day, three times per week, for a total of 4wk. After the treatment, the overall curative effect of the two groups and the latency and amplitude changes of P100 wave of pattern visual-evoked potential were counted. At the same time, nine children with left eye amblyopia were randomly selected from the two groups and were scanned with rs-fMRI before and after treatment. The differences in the brain regions between the two groups were compared and analyzed with VMHC. RESULTS: Chi-square test showed a notable difference in the total efficiency rate between the acupuncture (94.87%) and control groups (79.49%). Regarding the P100 wave latency and amplitude, the acupuncture group had significantly shorter latency and higher amplitude of P100 wave than the control group. Moreover, the VMHC values of the bilateral temporal lobe, superior temporal gyrus, and middle temporal gyrus were notably increased in the acupuncture group after treatment. CONCLUSION: Acupuncture combined with conventional treatment can significantly improve the corrected visual acuity and optic nerve conduction in children with anisometropic amblyopia. Compared with the conventional treatment, the regulation of acupuncture on the functional activities of the relevant brain areas in the anterior cerebellum may be an effective acupuncture mechanism for anisometropic amblyopia.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes
#541,Acupuncture transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation reduces discomfort associated with barostat-induced rectal distension: a randomized-controlled study,"AIM: To explore the effectiveness of acupuncture transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (Acu-TENS), a non-invasive modality in reduction of rectal discomfort during barostat-induced rectal distension. METHODS: Forty healthy subjects were randomized to receive 45 min of either Acu-TENS or placebo-TENS (no electrical output) over acupuncture points Hegu (large-intestine 4), Neiguan (pericardium 6) and Zusanli (stomach 36). A balloon catheter attached to a dual-drive barostat machine was then inserted into the subjects' rectum. A step-wise (4 mmHg) increase in balloon pressure was induced until maximal tolerable or 48 mmHg. Visual analogue scale and a 5-point subjective discomfort scale (no perception, first perception of distension, urge to defecate, discomfort/pain and extreme pain) were used to assess rectal discomfort at each distension pressure. Blood beta-endorphin levels were measured before, immediately after intervention, at 24 mmHg and at maximal tolerable distension pressure. RESULTS: There was no difference in the demographic data and baseline plasma beta-endorphin levels between the two groups. Perception threshold levels were higher in the Acu-TENS group when compared to the placebo group, but the difference reached statistical significance only at the sensations ""urge to defecate"" and ""pain"". The distension pressures recorded at the ""urge to defecate"" sensation for the Acu-TENS and placebo-TENS groups were 28.0 ± 4.5 mmHg and 24.6 ± 5.7 mmHg, respectively (P = 0.043); and the pressures recorded for the ""pain"" sensation for these two groups were 36.0 ± 4.2 mmHg and 30.5 ± 4.3 mmHg respectively (P = 0.002). Compared to the placebo group, a higher number of participants in the Acu-TENS group tolerated higher distension pressures (> 40 mmHg) (65% in Acu-TENS vs 25% in placebo, P = 0.02). The plasma beta-endorphin levels of the Acu-TENS group were significantly higher than that of the placebo group at barostat inflation pressure of 24 mmHg (1.31 ± 0.40 ng/mL vs 1.04 ± 0.43 ng/mL, P = 0.044) and at maximal inflation pressure (1.46 ± 0.53 ng/mL vs 0.95 ± 0.38 ng/mL, P = 0.003). CONCLUSION: Acu-TENS reduced rectal discomfort during barostat-induced rectal distension and concurrently associated with a rise in beta-endorphin level.",No,No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No
#542,Acupuncture management of pain and emergence agitation in children after bilateral myringotomy and tympanostomy tube insertion,"AIM: To further investigate the effect of acupuncture in postoperative pain and emergence agitation in children undergoing bilateral myringotomy and tympanostomy tube (BMT) placement. BACKGROUND: BMT insertion surgery in children is routinely performed under general anesthesia and is associated with a high incidence of postoperative pain and agitation upon emergence from anesthesia. Various medications have been investigated to alleviate the pain and agitation, which have been accompanied by high incidence of adverse effects. In children, anecdotal reports suggest that acupuncture may offer postoperative analgesia. METHODS/MATERIALS: This prospective randomized controlled trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of acupuncture to control pain and agitation after initial bilateral myringotomy tube placement in 60 nonpremedicated children. Acupuncture was applied at points LI-4 (he gu) and HT-7 (shen men) immediately after induction of anesthesia. A single-blinded assessor evaluated postoperative pain and agitation using CHEOPS and emergence agitation scale. Pain and agitation scores were significantly lower in the acupuncture group compared to those in the control group at the time of arrival in the post anesthesia care unit and during the subsequent 30 min. RESULTS: Acupuncture treatment provided significant benefit in pain and agitation reduction. The median time to first postoperative analgesic (acetaminophen) administration was significantly shorter in the control group. The number of patients who required analgesia was considerably fewer in the acupuncture group than that in the control. No adverse effects related to acupuncture treatment were observed. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that acupuncture therapy may be effective in diminishing both pain and emergence agitation in children after BMT insertion without adverse effects.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes
#546,"Elevated Triglyceride-Glucose Index Is Associated With Insulin Resistance, Metabolic Syndrome Components, Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease, and Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes in Chinese Women With Polycystic Ovary Syndrome","AIM: To investigate the associations of triglyceride-glucose index (TyG) with anthropometric characteristics, metabolic/endocrine profiles, and pregnancy outcomes in Chinese women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). METHODS: This secondary analysis of the Acupuncture and Clomiphene for Chinese Women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome trial (PCOSAct) included 956 participants with prospectively collected data. TyG was calculated using fasting triglyceride and glucose levels (Ln [TG (mg/dL) × FPG (mg/dL)/2]). Linear regression and trend analyses evaluated relationships between TyG and clinical parameters. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves assessed TyG's predictive capacity for insulin resistance (IR), metabolic syndrome (MS), and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Multivariable logistic regression estimated risks for metabolic outcomes and pregnancy outcomes. RESULTS: Linear trends revealed that the TyG was positively associated with age, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, hip circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, FPG, fasting insulin, the homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), total cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), apolipoprotein B, free androgen index, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and the prevalence of IR, MS, and NAFLD across various standards. Conversely, TyG was negatively correlated with the quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), apolipoprotein A1, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), and the prevalence of ovulation per cycle, conception, pregnancy, and live birth. After adjusting for age and BMI, a significant linear relationship was observed between TyG and components of MS, IR markers, and ALT. The ROC curve analysis indicated that the AUC(MS-IDF) was 0.871 (95% CI: 0.846-0.896), with a sensitivity of 81.4% and specificity of 81.2% at a cut-off value of 8.745, and the AUC(IR-HOMA-IR) was 0.782 (95% CI: 0.753-0.811), with 71.9% sensitivity and 70.3% specificity at a cut-off of 8.585, and the AUC(NAFLD) was 0.705 (95% CI: 0.644-0.766), with 76.8% sensitivity and 59.3% specificity at a cut-off value of 8.665. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that participants in the highest quartile (Q4) of TyG had significantly higher odds ratios (OR) for MS (OR: 38.36, 95% CI: 20.03-73.46, P-trend < 0.001) and IR (OR: 12.49, 95% CI: 7.3-21.35, P-trend < 0.001) compared to those in the lowest quartile (Q1), while NAFLD showed a marginal association (OR: 2.56, 95% CI: 1.00-6.55, P-trend = 0.069) after adjusting for confounding factors. Conversely, participants in Q1 of TyG had higher OR of conception (OR: 1.56, 95% CI: 1.04-2.35, p < 0.05), pregnancy (OR: 2.35, 95% CI: 1.46-3.79, p < 0.01), and live birth (OR: 2.32, 95% CI: 1.42-3.78, p < 0.01) compared to those in Q4 after adjusting for treatments. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated TyG index strongly associates with adverse metabolic trajectories, and adverse pregnancy outcomes in PCOS patients. This biomarker shows particular utility for identifying metabolic dysfunction, suggesting clinical potential for risk stratification in PCOS management.",Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#561,Effect of acupuncture on heart rate variability: a systematic review,"AIM: To summarize all relevant trials and critically evaluate the effect of acupuncture on heart rate variability (HRV). METHOD: This was a systematic review with meta-analysis. Keyword search was conducted in 7 databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Data extraction and risk of bias were done. RESULTS: Fourteen included studies showed a decreasing effect of acupuncture on low frequency (LF) and low frequency to high frequency ratio (LF/HF ratio) of HRV for nonhealthy subjects and on normalized low frequency (LF norm) for healthy subjects. The overall effect was in favour of the sham/control group for high frequency (HF) in nonhealthy subjects and for normalized high frequency (HF norm) in healthy subjects. Significant decreasing effect on HF and LF/HF ratio of HRV when acupuncture was performed on ST36 among healthy subjects and PC6 among both healthy and nonhealthy subjects, respectively. DISCUSSION: This study partially supports the possible effect of acupuncture in modulating the LF of HRV in both healthy and nonhealthy subjects, while previous review reported that acupuncture did not have any convincing effect on HRV in healthy subjects. More published work is needed in this area to determine if HRV can be an indicator of the therapeutic effect of acupuncture.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#570,Effect of Acupuncture on Cognitive Function in Patients With Post-Stroke Cognitive Impairment: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of acupuncture on post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI). BACKGROUND: PSCI is a major barrier to stroke patients' rehabilitation, and acupuncture is one of the treatments. However, the benefit of acupuncture on PSCI is unclear. DESIGN: A meta-analysis and systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). METHODS: Up to February 1, 2024, databases in PubMed, MEDLINE, Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, VIP, and Wanfang Data were searched. The risk of bias was investigated using the Cochrane Handbook for systematic reviews of treatments. Random-effect and fix-effect models were used to report the effects. RESULTS: There were 29 randomized clinical trials with 2477 participants included. The findings demonstrated that the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores were higher in the acupuncture group than medicine group (mean difference [MD] = 1.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) CI [1.26, 2.23], I(2) = 59%, p < 0.01). Compared to medicine group, the Loewenstein Occupational Therapy Cognitive Assessment (LOTCA) score exhibited a significant decrease and demonstrated improvement in the acupuncture group. Statistically significant outcomes were observed in the Barthel Index scores and P300 event-related potential (ERP). According to subgroup analysis, acupuncture was superior to conventional therapy for improving cognitive function in PSCI patients at 4 weeks after treatment. CONCLUSION: Acupuncture therapy has shown promise in ameliorating cognitive deficits and enhancing daily functional abilities in individuals diagnosed with PSCI. But future research should focus on the duration and implement large sample, high-quality RCTs. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Clinical workers in practical clinical work can select appropriate acupoints according to the actual conditions of patients, as well as confirm the treatment course of PSCI patients, while paying attention to observing and evaluating the therapeutic efficacy of acupuncture, to improve the health outcomes of patients in a patient-centered way.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#576,Effects of low-power laser auriculotherapy on chronic spinal pain: Randomized clinical trial,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of laser auriculotherapy on chronic spinal pain. It is a randomized controlled clinical trial. METHODS: Volunteers with chronic spinal pain underwent three evaluations: an initial evaluation, a final evaluation immediately after the last intervention session, and a 15-day follow-up. Pain intensity, nociceptive threshold in relation to mechanical stimulus, and degree of pain (the greatest and least pain) in the last seven days were the assessed variables. The experimental group (EG, n = 24) underwent 10 sessions of laser auriculotherapy twice a week, while the control group (CG, n = 23) did not receive any intervention. RESULTS: The EG showed great clinical improvement in relation to the variable pain intensity between pre- and post-interventions (65.2%) and pre-intervention and follow-up (58.62%) compared to the CG. There was a significant increase in the nociceptive threshold for the EG. In contrast, the CG showed a significant reduction in the nociceptive threshold. The intergroup analysis indicated an improvement in pain intensity for the EG (0.006). This result remained at the follow-up (0.012). The nociceptive threshold increased over time for the EG (0.016). In contrast, the CG showed a reduction in this variable with a significant difference over time (<0.001). CONCLUSION: The results of this clinical trial suggest that the proposed intervention may be effective in reducing pain intensity and increasing the nociceptive threshold. The effect of the intervention remained 15 days after the end of the treatment, when the volunteers were re-evaluated.",No,No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No
#578,Effects of noninvasive electroacupuncture on labour pain and duration,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effects of noninvasive electroacupuncture at LI4 or SP6 acupuncture points on labour pain and duration. BACKGROUND: The management of labour pain is one of the main goals of obstetrical care. Acupuncture has been reported to be useful for reducing labour length and for pain relief during labour. DESIGN: This was an experimental study with a control group. METHODS: The study was conducted at the Kayseri Maternity Hospital in Turkey. The participants were in the active phase of labour and were divided into three groups. In the LI4 group (n = 40), bilateral LI4 acupuncture points were stimulated using transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation-acupuncture pen. In the SP6 group (n = 40), the acupuncture points of both legs were stimulated. The same procedure that was performed for the LI4 group was used for the SP6 group. The control group (n = 40) did not receive any stimulation. Visual Analog Scale was used for the assessment of pain. RESULTS: Duration of labour from initiation of the intervention was 6·2 ± 6·0 hours in the LI4 group, 7·2 ± 6·1 hours in the SP6 group and 8·2 ± 9·9 hours in the control group. Pain scores in the LI4 group were found as 8·0 (4-10) in the 30th minute after the intervention, while they were 9·0 (4-10) in the SP6 group and 10·0 (2-10) in the control group. There was not a statistically significant difference between the groups in terms of labour duration and pain scores measured during contraction and between contractions. CONCLUSION: Although they were not statistically significant, labour pain scores and labour duration were lower in the acupuncture groups, especially in the LI4 group. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Noninvasive electroacupuncture on the LI4 acupuncture point could be used easily during labour for labour pain relief.",No,No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No
#585,Acupuncture reflexotherapy in the treatment of sensory urgency that persists after transurethral resection of the prostate: a preliminary report,"AIMS: In this study, we wanted to evaluate whether acupuncture reflexotherapy is able to treat the sensory irritative components of LUTS (lower urinary tract symptoms) that persist after transurethral resection of the prostate. METHODS: We have evaluated 42 patients, randomly selected into three groups: 14 patients received placebo, 15 patients received oxybutynin, and 13 patient were treated with electrostimulation by acupuncture reflexotherapy. RESULTS: Before treatment, the mean maximum flow rate (Qmax) was 21.0 +/- 3.2 mL/sec, the mean International Prostate Symptom Score (I-PSS) score was 12.9 +/- 4.2, the mean I-PSS Quality of Life (IPSS QoL) score was 3.6 +/- 1.2. At the first check-up performed after 3 months, we could observe that the I-PSS and QoL scores were 12.6 +/- 4.3 and 3.8 +/- 1.3 in the group who received placebo; the scores decreased to 11.1 +/- 3.2 and to 3.1 +/- 1.0, respectively, in the 15 patients treated with oxybutynin and decreased to 6.1 +/- 2.6 and 1.3 +/- 1.1, respectively, in the 13 patients who underwent acupuncture reflexotherapy. At 1-year follow-up, these parameters were practically similar. The voiding diaries allowed us to deduce that the average number of daytime voidings decreased by 8% in patients who received oxybutynin and decreased by 20% in 13 patients who underwent reflexotherapy; the average number of nocturnal micturitions decreased by approximately 20% and 60%, respectively, in patients who received oxybutynin and reflexotherapy.

#588,"The effects of auricular acupressure on blood pressure, stress, and sleep in elders with essential hypertension: a randomized single-blind sham-controlled trial","AIMS: Reduction of blood pressure and improvement of stress and sleep disorders in patients with essential hypertension were important factors. This study aimed to examine the effects of auricular acupressure on blood pressure, stress, and sleep quality among elderly with essential hypertension in Korea. METHODS AND RESULTS: This study was a single-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study. The experimental group (n = 23) received 8 weeks of auricular acupressure intervention on specific acupoints (superior triangular fossa, Shenmen, kidney, heart, and occiput) related to blood pressure, pulse rate, stress, and sleep, whereas the control group (n = 23) received auricular acupressure on non-specific acupoints. The primary outcomes were the systolic and diastolic blood pressure measured weekly. The secondary outcomes were the pulse rate, heart rate variability, actigraphy measured through Fitbit, and the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) were measured before and after the experiment. There were statistically significant differences between two groups in systolic blood pressure (F = 5.67, P = 0.022), diastolic blood pressure (17.53, P < 0.001), and pulse rate (F = 6.78, P = 0.013) over time. Stress index (χ2 = 2.12, P = 0.040) and sleep efficiency (χ2 = 3.57, P = 0.001) were also significantly different before and after the experiment. However, there was no significant difference in the PSQI. CONCLUSION: The findings showed that auricular acupressure leads to improvements in blood pressure, stress, and sleep in elderly people with essential hypertension. Therefore, auricular acupressure can be used as an alternative nursing intervention for hypertension prevention, stress, and sleep management.

#598,Cost effectiveness of using moxibustion to correct non-vertex presentation,"AIMS: To analyse the cost effectiveness of using the moxibustion technique to correct non-vertex presentation and to reduce the number of caesarean sections performed at term. METHOD: A deterministic model of decision analysis has been developed to analyse the cost of treatment in which heat is applied by moxibustion (the combustion of Artemisia vulgaris) at acupuncture point BL67 for pregnant women with non-vertex fetal position at 33-35 weeks' gestation. This approach was compared with conventional treatment recommendations based on the knee-chest posture technique. The costs were obtained mainly from data provided by the Andalusian Public Health System. Effectiveness data for the baseline analysis were taken from a previous clinical study. A secondary analysis was performed based on a meta-analysis conducted using random effects analysis, by reference to studies published in recent systematic reviews of moxibustion versus conventional treatment, in order to make the results generalisable to other healthcare settings. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed under diverse assumptions to assess the uncertainty of the result. RESULTS: The baseline analysis shows that the application of moxibustion prevents 8.92% of deliveries with non-vertex presentation compared with conventional treatment, with an average cost saving of €107.11 per delivery, mainly due to the cost saving from avoiding the need for caesarean section. The meta-analysis revealed a relative risk of the version of non-vertex presentation at term of 0.34 (95% CI 0.16 to 0.76). The sensitivity analysis showed that moxibustion can avoid 0.34 caesarean sections, with an incremental cost per delivery ranging from €68 to -€640 for moxibustion versus conventional treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Moxibustion treatment applied at acupuncture point BL67 can avoid the need for caesarean section and achieve cost savings for the healthcare system in comparison with conventional treatment.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#600,Acupuncture for temporomandibular disorders: a systematic review,"AIMS: To assess the effectiveness of acupuncture for the symptomatic treatment of temporomandibular disorders (TMD) from a review of studies using randomized controlled trials (RCTs). METHODS: Electronic databases were systematically searched for articles reporting RCTs investigating acupuncture for TMD. The methodological qualities of eligible studies were assessed using the criteria described in the Cochrane Handbook. RESULTS: Nineteen reports were systematically reviewed. There was moderate evidence that classical acupuncture had a positive influence beyond those of placebo (three trials, 65 participants); had positive effects similar to those of occlusal splint therapy (three trials, 160 participants); and was more effective for TMD symptoms than physical therapy (four trials, 397 participants), indomethacin plus vitamin B1 (two trials, 85 participants), and a wait-list control (three trials, 138 participants). Only two RCTs addressed adverse events and reported no serious adverse events. CONCLUSION: This systematic review noted moderate evidence that acupuncture is an effective intervention to reduce symptoms associated with TMD. There is a need for acupuncture trials with adequate sample sizes that address the long-term efficacy or effectiveness of acupuncture.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#606,Acupuncture and sham acupuncture reduce muscle pain in myofascial pain patients,"AIMS: To compare the effectiveness of dry needling in classically recognized acupuncture points (""acupuncture"") with dry needling in skin areas not recognized as acupuncture points (""sham acupuncture"") in reducing masseter muscle pain in a group of patients with myofascial pain of the jaw muscles. METHODS: Eighteen patients were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 experimental groups: Ten patients received acupuncture and 8 received sham acupuncture. A visual analog scale (VAS) was used to measure changes in masseter muscle pain evoked by mechanical stimulation of the masseter muscle before and after the experiment. RESULTS: Both groups showed a statistically significant reduction in VAS pain scores (P = .001). Seven out of 10 acupuncture subjects had a 10 mm or greater VAS reduction in pain, while 4 out of 8 of the sham acupuncture subjects had that great a pain reduction. There was no significant difference between the 2 groups. CONCLUSION: Both acupuncture and sham acupuncture reduced pain evoked by mechanical stimulation of the masseter muscles in myofascial pain patients. However, this reduction in pain was not dependent on whether the needling was performed in standard acupuncture points or in other areas of the skin. These results suggest that pain reduction resulting from a noxious stimulus (i.e., needling) may not be specific to the location of the stimulus as predicted by the classical acupuncture literature.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes
#613,Role of acupuncture in the management of diabetic painful neuropathy (DPN): a pilot RCT,"AIMS: To examine the role of acupuncture in the treatment of diabetic painful neuropathy (DPN) using a single-blind, placebo-controlled RCT and to collect data that would be required in a future definitive study of the efficacy of acupuncture in DPN. METHODS: 45 patients were allocated to receive a 10-week course either of real (53%) or sham (47%) acupuncture. Five standardised acupuncture points on the lower limb of each leg were used in the study: LR3, KI3, SP6, SP10 and ST36. Outcome measures included the Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs (LANSS) scale, lower limb pain (Visual Analogue Scale, VAS); Sleep Problem Scale (SPS); Measure Yourself Medical Outcome Profile (MYMOP); 36-item Short Form 36 Health Survey and resting blood pressure (BP). RESULTS: Over the 10-week treatment period, small improvements were seen in VAS -15 (-26 to -3.5), MYMOP -0.89 (-1.4 to -0.3), SPS -2.5 (-4.2 to -0.82) and resting diastolic BP -5.2 (-10.4 to -0.14) in the true acupuncture group. In contrast, there was little change in those receiving sham acupuncture. A moderate treatment effect in favour of active acupuncture was detected in MYMOP scores -0.66 (-0.96 to -0.35) but non-significant effect sizes in LANSS Pain Scale -0.37 (-2.2 to 1.4), resting diastolic BP -0.50 (-3.0 to 1.99) and the SPS -0.51 (-2.2 to 1.16). CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated the practicality and feasibility of acupuncture as an additional treatment for people with DPN. The treatment was well tolerated with no appreciable side effects. Larger randomised trials are needed to confirm the clinical and cost-effectiveness of acupuncture in the treatment of DPN.

#618,Smoke or smokeless moxibustion treatment for breech presentation: A three-arm pilot trial,"AIMS: We conducted a pilot trial to compare the effects of smoke and smokeless moxibustion with a control as a possible supplement to external cephalic version (ECV) for converting breech to cephalic presentation and increasing adherence to cephalic position, and to assess their effects on the well-being of the mother and child. METHODS: We used a quasi-experimental design with 3 arms: a smoke moxibustion (SM) (n = 20) and smokeless moxibustion (SLM) (n = 20) groups (20-min acupoint BL67 stimulation once or twice daily for 10-14 days), and a control group (n = 20). The participants had singleton breech presentations between 33 and 35 gestation weeks. The primary outcome was cephalic presentation at the conclusion of intervention. The secondary outcomes were cephalic presentation at birth and effects on mother and child well-being. RESULTS: At the conclusion of intervention, cephalic presentation was higher in the SLM (60.0%) than the control groups (25.0%), Relative Risk 2.40, 95% Confidence Interval [1.04-5.56]; there was no significant difference for SM. At birth, there were no significant differences in cephalic presentation or well-being. CONCLUSION: SLM treatment showed an increasing trend towards cephalic presentation at the conclusion of intervention. Although significant differences were not observed at birth possibly due to the small samples and non-randomization, moxibustion was safe, and not associated with perinatal morbidity and mortality. A randomized controlled trial with a larger sample is warranted to ascertain SLM treatment as a possible ECV supplement for converting and increasing adherence to cephalic position.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#623,Moxibustion with Chinese herbal has good effect on allergic rhinitis,"Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a chronic inflammatory disease of rhino-ocular mucosa, affecting up to 40% of population worldwide. Chinese herbal medicines and Acupuncture, adopted thousands of years in China, has good effect on allergic rhinitis. This study evaluates the effects of Moxibustion with Chinese herbal in treating patients with allergic rhinitis over a 1-year follow-up. A randomized controlled trial was conducted in a sample of 355 participants recruited from Guangdong general hospital of China. After baseline measurements, participants were randomly assigned to treatment-group or control group. Treatment group received Moxibustion with Chinese herbal. Control group received Loratadine. The main outcomes, including symptom severity and quality of life were measured using the Allergic Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ). Both moxibustion with Chinese herbal and Loratadine improve nose symptoms such as stuffy/blocked, sneezing, runny nose, itchy nose, sore nose and post-nasal drip in patients with AR. Symptoms fatigue, loss of taste, afraid of cold/wind and cold limb were improved significantly in moxibustion with Chinese herbal group. The mean quality of life scores decreased in both groups after treatment. Compare to control group, moxibustion with Chinese herbal is more effective than Loratadine in improving the quality of life in patients with AR. The results show moxibustion with Chinese herbal was effective to reduce symptoms and enhance quality of life in patients with allergic rhinitis.

#625,The effect of acupuncture on allergic rhinitis: a randomized controlled clinical trial,"Allergic rhinitis is a common health problem usually treated with drug therapy. Some patients experience side effects of drug therapy while others fear the use of drugs. Acupuncture is an interesting alternative to traditional treatment. The few studies evaluating acupuncture indicate a possible clinical effect on allergic rhinitis. This study compared active versus sham acupuncture in 40 consecutive patients with a history of allergic rhinitis and a positive skin test. Patients were randomized and assessed prior to treatment and then reassessed after 12 months. Improvements in symptoms using visual analogue scales, reduction in skin test reactions and levels of specific immunoglobin E (IgE) were used to compare the effect of treatment. For one allergen, mugwort, a greater reduction in levels of specific IgE (p = 0.019, 0.039) and skin test reaction (p = 0.004) was seen in the group receiving active acupuncture compared to the group receiving sham acupuncture. However, this finding might be an artifact. No differences in clinical symptoms were seen between active versus sham acupuncture, thus the conclusion being that the effect of acupuncture on allergic rhinitis should be further evaluated in larger randomized studies.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes
#633,Phantom Acupuncture Induces Placebo Credibility and Vicarious Sensations: A Parallel fMRI Study of Low Back Pain Patients,"Although acupuncture is an effective therapeutic intervention for pain reduction, the exact difference between real and sham acupuncture has not been clearly understood because a somatosensory tactile component is commonly included in the existing sham acupuncture protocols. In an event-related fMRI experiment, we implemented a novel form of sham acupuncture, phantom acupuncture, that reproduces the acupuncture needling procedure without somatosensory tactile stimulation while maintaining the credibility of the acupuncture treatment context. Fifty-six non-specific low back pain patients received either real (REAL) or phantom (PHNT) acupuncture stimulation in a parallel group study. The REAL group exhibited greater activation in the posterior insula and anterior cingulate cortex, reflecting the needling-specific components of acupuncture. We demonstrated that PHNT could be delivered credibly. Interestingly, the PHNT-credible group exhibited bilateral activation in SI/SII and also reported vicarious acupuncture sensations without needling stimulation. The PHNT group showed greater activation in the bilateral dorsolateral/ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC/vlPFC). Moreover, the PHNT group exhibited significant pain reduction, with a significant correlation between the subjective fMRI signal in the right dlPFC/vlPFC and a score assessing belief in acupuncture effectiveness. These results support an expectation-related placebo analgesic effect on subjective pain intensity ratings, possibly mediated by right prefrontal cortex activity.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes
#634,Acupuncture for the treatment of obesity: a review of the evidence,"Although acupuncture is being utilized to treat a variety of important health problems, its usefulness in obesity management has not yet been fully evaluated. The aim of this review paper was to survey and critically evaluate the descriptive and controlled trials of acupuncture for enhancing weight loss. The underlying principles of acupoint stimulation are described, with an emphasis on auricular (ear) acupuncture, the method most often chosen for obesity studies. The difficulties of selecting suitable placebo controls are highlighted. To date, most trials have been descriptive in nature, of short duration (< or = 12 weeks), and designed using nonstandard treatment protocols. Despite the unique challenges involved, further careful study of acupuncture's potential usefulness as an adjunct in weight management is recommended. An agenda for future research in this area is provided.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#642,Electroacupuncture for Temporomandibular Disorders: A Systematic Review of Randomized Controlled Trials,"Although electroacupuncture (EA) is an effective treatment for pain relief, there has been no systematic review of EA treatment for temporomandibular disorder TMD. This systematic review aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of EA in TMD management. We searched 14 databases until April 2021 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effects of EA on TMDs. Eleven RCTs with 667 patients that used three acupuncture points (ST6, ST7, and LI4) were included. Two RCTs reported significant effects of EA plus microwave treatment compared with EA treatment alone on the total effectiveness rate (TER) for TMD. Further, two studies reported that compared with ultrashort wave alone, EA plus ultrashort wave had a significant effect on the TER for TMD and visual analog scale. All RCTs did not report adverse events. Our findings demonstrated the positive potential of EA in TMD management. However, there was weak evidence regarding EA use for TMD management given the poor quality and small sample sizes of the included studies. In the future, well-designed RCTs are required. It is necessary to investigate clinical trials and systematic reviews to compare the effectiveness and safety of EA and acupuncture for TMD.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#674,Characterizing the in-out asymmetry in visual crowding,"An object's processing is impaired by the presence of nearby clutter. Several distinct mechanisms, such as masking and visual crowding, are thought to contribute to such flanker-induced interference. It is therefore important to determine which mechanism is operational in any given situation. Previous studies have proposed that the in-out asymmetry (IOA), where a peripheral flanker interferes with the target more than a foveal flanker, is diagnostic of crowding. However, several studies have documented inconsistencies in the occurrence of this asymmetry, particularly at locations beyond the horizontal meridian, casting doubt on its ability to delineate crowding. In this study, to determine if IOA is diagnostic of crowding, we extensively charted its properties. We asked a relatively large set of participants (n = 38) to identify a briefly presented peripheral letter flanked by a single inward or outward letter at one of four locations. We also manipulated target location uncertainty and attentional allocation by blocking, randomizing or pre-cueing the target location. Using multilevel Bayesian regression analysis, we found robust IOA at all locations, although its strength was modulated by target location, location uncertainty, and attentional allocation. Our findings suggest that IOA can be an excellent marker of crowding, to the extent that it is not observed in other flanker-interference mechanisms, such as masking.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#702,Are patients who use alternative medicine dissatisfied with orthodox medicine?,"Approximately 45% of asthmatic families and 47% of non-asthmatic families had consulted an alternative-medicine practitioner at some time. The most popular form of alternative medicine was chiropractic (21.1% and 26.4%, respectively), followed by homoeopathy/naturopathy (18.8% and 12.7%, respectively), acupuncture (9.4% and 10.9%, respectively), and herbal medicine (4.7% and 6.4%, respectively), while the remainder (20.3% and 11.8% respectively) was distributed among iridology, osteopathy, hypnosis, faith healing and megavitamin therapy. More families were satisfied with orthodox medicine (87.1% and 93.6%, respectively) than with alternative medicine (84.2% and 75.1%, respectively). Crosstabulation analysis of pooled data both from asthma and from non-asthma groups showed that 76.4% were satisfied both with orthodox and with alternative medicine, and 16.4% were satisfied with orthodox, but not with alternative, medicine. In contrast, only 2.7% were dissatisfied with orthodox medicine and satisfied with alternative medicine (chi2 = 9.33; P less than 0.01). These findings do not support the view that patients who use alternative medicine are those who are disgruntled with orthodox medicine.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#704,"Therapeutic options for aromatase inhibitor-associated arthralgia in breast cancer survivors: A systematic review of systematic reviews, evidence mapping, and network meta-analysis","Aromatase inhibitor-associated arthralgia (AIA) is a common problem in breast cancer survivors and is associated with noncompliance with aromatase inhibitor therapy. The aim of this research was to assess the current evidence for the various therapeutic options available for AIA. We searched the PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects for systematic reviews of trials investigating treatments for AIA to June 2018. Eligible systematic reviews were subjected to evidence mapping and the randomized controlled trials included in the systematic reviews were hand-searched for a network meta-analysis. Six systematic reviews were included in the evidence mapping. Acupuncture was the most common treatment modality studied (four randomized controlled trials), and pharmacological interventions, aerobic exercise, Nordic walking, omega-3 fatty acids, and vitamin D were assessed less frequently. In view of the limitations in the overall confidence level for each review, the evidence for acupuncture as an effective treatment for AIA was considered low. Second, data from 6 randomized controlled trials were included in the network meta-analysis. When compared with a waiting list control, acupuncture (mean difference [MD] -2.00, 95% confidence interval [CI] -3.16, -0.84), aerobic exercise (MD -0.80, 95% CI -1.33, -0.016), and omega-3 fatty acids (MD -2.10, 95% CI -3.23, -0.97) significantly improved pain severity scores. Network meta-analysis of adverse events was not possible because of poor reporting. Acupuncture is presently the most widely investigated intervention but is recommended for AIA with low overall confidence based on the current evidence.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#726,[The role of acupuncture in asthma],"Asthma is a chronic inflammatory syndrome of airways, in which different cells and their mediators play a role originating damage clinically expressed by recurrent respiratory symptoms. Current therapy of asthma is focused to reduce airway inflammation, diminishing long-term bronchial hyperactivity and rescue treatment (when required). Unfortunately, the failure of current therapies of asthma has increased the number of patients searching for approximations in complementary and alternative medicine. Scientific evidence is still scarce for establishing that alternative medicine is more effective than placebo in asthma. However, this does not mean that it is ineffective, maybe more multicentric clinical assays are needed, with methodological rigor, to establish final conclusions of efficacy and safety of complementary medicine. Thus, until such results are available, it is better to be skeptical and not to recommend acupuncture for asthma treatment.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#755,Research status and prospects of acupuncture for autism spectrum disorders,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder and has a predilection for children. Its symptoms, such as lifelong social communication deficits and repetitive sensory-motor behaviors, put a huge burden on the patient's family and society. Currently, there is no cure for ASD, and some medications that can improve its symptoms are often accompanied by adverse effects. Among many complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies, acupuncture has shown promising application potential, but after years of practice, it has not been recognized as the preferred CAM therapy for ASD. Therefore, we analyzed and discussed the clinical study reports of acupuncture in the treatment of ASD in the past 15 years from the aspects of study subjects, group setting, intervention modalities, acupoint selection, outcome evaluation, and safety. The data accumulated at present are not sufficient to support the clinical effectiveness of acupuncture in ASD and to justify its use in clinical practice. They provide, however, initial evidence of possible effectiveness and encourage further investigation in order to reach firm conclusions. Based on a comprehensive analysis, we believed that following the Standards for Reporting Interventions in Clinical Trials of Acupuncture (STRICTA) and Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT), screening the optimal combination of acupoints applying a rigorous scientific study design, and performing the related functional experiments may be the effective way to convincingly test the hypothesis that acupuncture may be beneficial in ASD patients. The significance of this review is to provide a reference for researchers to carry out high-quality clinical trials of acupuncture in the treatment of ASD from the perspective of the combination of modern medicine and traditional Chinese medicine.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#760,An eye-tracking approach to Autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR): The physiology and nature of tingles in relation to the pupil,"Autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR) is a sensory phenomenon commonly characterized by pleasant tingling sensations arising from the back of the head and accompanied by feelings of relaxation and calmness. Although research has found ASMR to have a distinct physiological pattern with increased skin conductance levels and reduced heart rate, the specific tingles felt in ASMR have not received much investigation. The aim of the present study was to investigate the physiology and characteristics of ASMR further by examining whether experiencing ASMR is visible from the pupil of the eye. A total of 91 participants were recruited and assigned to three different groups based on their experience of ASMR (ASMR vs. non-ASMR vs. unsure). Participants were instructed to watch a control video and an ASMR video and to report any tingling sensations by pressing down a button on the keyboard. Pupil diameter was measured over the duration of both videos using a tower-mounted eye tracker. Data was analyzed on a general level, averaging pupil diameter over each video, as well as on a more specific level, comparing pupil diameter during reported episodes of tingling sensations to pupil diameter outside of those episodes. On the general level, results revealed no significant differences between the groups. On the specific level, however, the tingling sensations experienced in ASMR were found to cause statistically significant increases in pupil diameter, demonstrating that they have a physiological basis. The results of the study further reinforce the credibility of ASMR and suggest that the tingles felt in ASMR are at the very core of the experience itself.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#772,Canadian Association of Gastroenterology Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS),"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common gastrointestinal (GI) disorders, affecting about 10% of the general population globally. The aim of this consensus was to develop guidelines for the management of IBS. METHODS: A systematic literature search identified studies on the management of IBS. The quality of evidence and strength of recommendations were rated according to the Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Statements were developed through an iterative online platform and then finalized and voted on by a multidisciplinary group of clinicians and a patient. RESULTS: Consensus was reached on 28 of 31 statements. Irritable bowel syndrome is diagnosed based on symptoms; serological testing is suggested to exclude celiac disease, but routine testing for C-reactive protein (CRP), fecal calprotectin or food allergies is not recommended. A trial of a low fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, polyols (FODMAP) diet is suggested, while a gluten-free diet is not. Psyllium, but not wheat bran, supplementation may help reduce symptoms. Alternative therapies such as peppermint oil and probiotics are suggested, while herbal therapies and acupuncture are not. Cognitive behavioural therapy and hypnotherapy are suggested psychological therapies. Among the suggested or recommended pharmacological therapies are antispasmodics, certain antidepressants, eluxadoline, lubiprostone, and linaclotide. Loperamide, cholestyramine and osmotic laxatives are not recommended for overall IBS symptoms. The nature of the IBS symptoms (diarrhea-predominant or constipation-predominant) should be considered in the choice of pharmacological treatments. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with IBS may benefit from a multipronged, individualized approach to treatment, including dietary modifications, psychological and pharmacological therapies.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#786,Noneffectiveness of electroacupuncture for comorbid generalized anxiety disorder and irritable bowel syndrome,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Comorbid generalized anxiety disorder and irritable bowel syndrome are common and therapeutically challenging. We aimed to assess the effectiveness of electroacupuncture in relieving anxiety and bowel symptoms in Chinese adults with this form of comorbidity. METHODS: In a single-blind randomized sham-controlled trial, subjects with comorbid generalized anxiety disorder and irritable bowel syndrome were randomly assigned to receive 10 weekly sessions of electroacupuncture or sham electroacupuncture. Patients were assessed at baseline, immediately after intervention and at 6-week follow-up. Primary outcome was anxiety (7-item Patient Health Questionnaire section for anxiety). Secondary outcomes included bowel symptoms (bowel symptoms questionnaire), depressive symptoms (9-item Patient Health Questionnaire), somatic symptoms (15-item Patient Health Questionnaire), and health-related quality of life (EuroQol-5 Dimensions). RESULTS: Eighty subjects, 40 in each arm, were randomized. All but two in the sham group completed 10 weekly sessions. There was no significant difference in the proportion of patients experiencing significant (≥ 50%) reduction of anxiety symptoms between the two groups immediately after intervention (32.4% vs 21.6%, P = 0.06) and at 6-week follow-up (25.7% in electroacupuncture vs 27% in sham, P = 0.65). Anxiety, depressive symptom, and bowel symptom severity did not differ significantly between electroacupuncture and sham groups.

#790,"Precision laser acupuncture at back-shu points enhances growth performance, feed efficiency, and hormonal regulation in rabbits","BACKGROUND AND AIM: Laser acupuncture has emerged as a promising non-pharmacological approach to enhance productivity in livestock. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of laser acupuncture applied to specific back-shu points (Bladder [BL]13, BL15, and BL21) on growth performance, feed conversion ratio (FCR), feed efficiency (FE), and growth hormone (GH) levels in rabbits. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 24 male Hycole rabbits were randomly assigned to three groups (n = 8): Group A (placebo control), Group B (laser acupuncture on BL13, BL15, and BL21), and Group C (laser acupuncture on non-specific points). Treatments were conducted weekly over a 6-week period using a 0.2-joule semiconductor laser device. Body weight, feed intake, FCR, FE, and GH concentrations were recorded. GH levels were analyzed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Data were statistically evaluated using a one-way analysis of variance followed by Duncan's post hoc test. RESULTS: Group B showed significantly higher final body weight (1.97 ± 0.07 kg), weight gain (919 ± 128 g), GH levels (1.75 ± 0.12 ng/mL), improved FCR (2.67 ± 0.07), and greater FE (37.45% ± 1.09%) compared to Groups A and C (p < 0.05). No significant differences were observed between Groups A and C, indicating the importance of targeting precise acupuncture points for therapeutic effectiveness. CONCLUSION: Laser acupuncture at BL13, BL15, and BL21 significantly enhances metabolic efficiency, growth performance, and hormonal regulation in rabbits. The precision of point application is critical for achieving optimal physiological benefits. This technique provides a sustainable and non-invasive approach to enhancing feed utilization and productivity in rabbit farming and holds promise for broader application in modern animal husbandry.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#793,"""The effect of acupressure on fatigue in individuals with chronic fatigue syndrome""","BACKGROUND AND AIM: Patients with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) often experience fatigue that greatly affects their quality of life. We aimed to investigate the effectiveness of acupressure in alleviating CFS symptoms in office workers. METHODS: We conducted a randomized controlled trial with 39 participants (28 women, 11 men; average age 29.54 ± 1.27). Participants were divided into treatment and control groups. The acupressure group received 10 sessions over 4 weeks, targeting specific acupoints (Li4, HT7, L9, P6, Gb20, Anmian, Du20, Yin-Tang, Sp6). Each point was stimulated for 30-90 s until numbness was felt; otherwise, stimulation lasted 90 s, totaling approximately 30 min per session. The control group did not receive any treatment. We assessed fatigue using the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), quality of life using the Short Form-36 (SF-36), and depressive symptoms using the Beck Depression Scale (BDS) before and after treatment. Data were analyzed using SPSS 22.0. RESULTS: We observed a significant reduction in fatigue severity in the acupressure group compared to the control group, where fatigue severity increased (p = 0.009). The acupressure group also demonstrated significant improvements in depressive symptoms (p = 0.000) and various quality of life sub-parameters: physical function (p = 0.02), physical role difficulty (p = 0.002), emotional role difficulty (p = 0.007), energy (p = 0.002), and mental health (p = 0.05).

#801,Electroacupuncture plus on-demand gastrocaine for refractory functional dyspepsia: Pragmatic randomized trial,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Treatment options for functional dyspepsia (FD) refractory to pharmacological treatments are limited but the effectiveness of electroacupuncture (EA) is uncertain. We assessed the effectiveness of EA combined with on-demand gastrocaine. METHODS: We conducted a single-center, assessor-blind, randomized parallel-group 2-arm trial on Helicobacter pylori negative FD patients of the postprandial distress syndrome subtype refractory to proton pump inhibitor, prokinetics, or H(2) antagonists. Enrolled participants were block randomized in a 1:1 ratio, with concealed random sequence. The treatment and control groups both received on-demand gastrocaine for 12 weeks, but only those in treatment group were offered 20 sessions of EA over 10 weeks. The primary endpoint was the between-group difference in proportion of patients achieving adequate relief of symptoms at week 12. RESULTS: Of 132 participants randomly assigned to EA plus on-demand gastrocaine (n = 66) or on-demand gastrocaine alone (n = 66), 125 (94.7%) completed all follow-up at 12 weeks. The EA group had a compliance rate 97.7%. They had a significantly higher likelihood in achieving adequate symptom relief at 12 weeks, with a clinically relevant number needed to treat (NNT) value of 2.36 (95% CI: 1.74, 3.64). Among secondary outcomes, statistically and clinically significant improvements were observed among global symptom (NNT = 3.85 [95% CI: 2.63, 7.69]); postprandial fullness and early satiation (NNT = 5.00 [95% CI: 2.86, 25.00]); as well as epigastric pain, epigastric burning, and postprandial nausea (NNT = 4.17 [95% CI: 2.56, 11.11]). Adverse events were minimal and nonsignificant. CONCLUSION: For refractory FD, EA provides significant, clinically relevant symptom relief when added to on-demand gastrocaine (ChiCTR-IPC-15007109).",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#810,Randomised controlled trials of non-pharmacological interventions to improve patient-reported outcomes of colonoscopy: a scoping review,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Non-pharmacological interventions to improve patient-reported outcomes of colonoscopy may be effective at mitigating negative experiences and perceptions of the procedure, but research to characterise the extent and features of studies of these interventions is limited. METHODS: We conducted a scoping review searching multiple databases for peer-reviewed publications of randomised controlled trials conducted in adults investigating a non-pharmacological intervention to improve patient-reported outcomes of colonoscopy. Study characteristics were tabulated and summarised narratively and graphically. RESULTS: We screened 5939 citations and 962 full texts, and included 245 publications from 39 countries published between 1992 and 2022. Of these, 80.8% were full publications and 19.2% were abstracts. Of the 41.9% of studies reporting funding sources, 11.4% were unfunded. The most common interventions were carbon dioxide and/or water insufflation methods (33.9%), complementary and alternative medicines (eg, acupuncture) (20.0%), and colonoscope technology (eg, magnetic scope guide) (21.6%). Pain was as an outcome across 82.0% of studies. Studies most often used a patient-reported outcome examining patient experience during the procedure (60.0%), but 42.9% of studies included an outcome without specifying the time that the patient experienced the outcome. Most intraprocedural patient-reported outcomes were measured retrospectively rather than contemporaneously, although studies varied in terms of when outcomes were assessed. CONCLUSION: Research on non-pharmacological interventions to improve patient-reported outcomes of colonoscopy is unevenly distributed across types of intervention and features high variation in study design and reporting, in particular around outcomes. Future research efforts into non-pharmacological interventions to improve patient-reported outcomes of colonoscopy should be directed at underinvestigated interventions and developing consensus-based guidelines for study design, with particular attention to how and when outcomes are experienced and measured.

#811,Acupuncture for alcohol withdrawal: a randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Previous trials on acupuncture in alcohol addiction were in outpatients and focused on relapse prevention. Rates of dropout were high and interpretation of results difficult. We compared auricular laser and needle acupuncture with sham laser stimulation in reducing the duration of alcohol withdrawal. METHODS: Inpatients undergoing alcohol withdrawal were randomly allocated to laser acupuncture (n = 17), needle acupuncture (n = 15) or sham laser stimulation (n = 16). Attempts were made to blind patients, therapists and outcome assessors, but this was not feasible for needle acupuncture. The duration of withdrawal symptoms (as assessed using a nurse-rated scale) was the primary outcome; the duration of sedative prescription was the secondary outcome. RESULTS: Patients randomized to laser and sham laser had identical withdrawal symptom durations (median 4 days). Patients randomized to needle stimulation had a shorter duration of withdrawal symptoms (median 3 days; P = 0.019 versus sham intervention), and tended to have a shorter duration of sedative use, but these differences diminished after adjustment for baseline differences. CONCLUSIONS: The data from this pilot trial do not suggest a relevant benefit of auricular laser acupuncture for alcohol withdrawal. A larger trial including adequate sham interventions is needed, however, to reliably determine the effectiveness of any type of auricular acupuncture in this condition.",No,No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No
#816,Rehabilitation of motor function after stroke: A bibliometric analysis of global research from 2004 to 2022,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The mortality rate of stroke has been increasing worldwide. Poststroke somatic dysfunctions are common. Motor function rehabilitation of patients with such somatic dysfunctions enhances the quality of life and has long been the primary practice to achieve functional recovery. In this regard, we aimed to delineate the new trends and frontiers in stroke motor function rehabilitation literature published from 2004 to 2022 using a bibliometric software. METHODS: All documents related to stroke rehabilitation and published from 2004 to 2022 were retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection. Publication output, research categories, countries/institutions, authors/cocited authors, journals/cocited journals, cocited references, and keywords were assessed using VOSviewer v.1.6.15.0 and CiteSpace version 5.8. The cocitation map was plotted according to the analysis results to intuitively observe the research hotspots. RESULTS: Overall, 3,302 articles were retrieved from 78 countries or regions and 564 institutions. Over time, the publication outputs increased annually. In terms of national contribution, the United States published the most papers, followed by China, Japan, South Korea, and Canada. Yeungnam University had the most articles among all institutions, followed by Emory University, Fudan University, and National Taiwan University. Jang Sung Ho and Wolf S.L. were the most productive (56 published articles) and influential (cited 1,121 times) authors, respectively. ""Effect of constraint-induced movement therapy on upper extremity function 3-9 months after stroke: the Extremity Constraint Induced Therapy Evaluation randomized clinical trial"" was the most frequently cited reference. Analysis of keywords showed that upper limbs, Fugl-Meyer assessment, electromyography, virtual reality, telerehabilitation, exoskeleton, and brain-computer interface were the research development trends and focus areas for this topic.

#824,Randomized controlled trial to treat migraine with acupuncture: design and protocol,"BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATION: The effectiveness of using acupuncture to treat migraine is rarely and even suspectedly reported in the literature. In this article, we report the design and the protocol of a randomized controlled large-scale trial to treat migraine using acupuncture, aiming at testifying it is effective to use acupuncture to treat migraine. We demonstrate also that the effectiveness of the treatment may vary due to using acupoints of different meridians or different acupoints of one meridian. METHODS AND DESIGN: A multi-center randomized controlled trial is currently undergoing, with three acupoints treatment groups and one non-acupoints control group. The acupuncture treatment consists of 20 sessions per patient with a observation period of 20 weeks. In total, 480 patients with migraine are registered in this study within 8 hospitals in China from March 2008 to June 2009. These patients are randomly assigned to receive one of the following four acupoints treatment groups, i.e. 1) specific acupoints of Shaoyang meridians (120 patients), 2) non-specific acupoints of Shaoyang meridians (120 patients), 3) acupoints of other meridians (120 patients); or 4) non-acupoints control group (120 patients). The main outcome measurement in this trial is the effect comparison achieved among these four groups in terms of number of days with migraine and intensity of migraine during and after the baseline phase, i.e. the first 4 weeks before randomization and 4, 8 and 16 weeks after randomization. The intensity of headache including headache intensity grade (0-3) and visual analogue scale (VAS) score will also be used in this study. In addition, the differences of Migraine-Specific Quality-of-Life Questionnaire (MSQ) and Transcranial Doppler Sonography (TCD) before and after randomization are also used as the secondary outcome measurement. DISCUSSION: The result of this trial (which will be available in 2009) will demonstrate the efficacy of using acupuncture to treat migraine, and verify whether the specific effect of acupoints exists and whether this specific effect of acupoints is related to meridian and a collection of meridian Qi.

#840,Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation at the Acupuncture Points to Relieve Pain of Patients Under Mechanical Ventilation: A Randomized Controlled Study,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Electrical stimulation and acupuncture points as nonpharmacological methods have been the focus of pain reduction in different patients. This study is aimed at determining the effects of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) on the acupuncture points of pain in patients under mechanical ventilators. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This randomized double-blind clinical trial study was conducted on 50 patients undergoing mechanical ventilation in intensive care units of Imam Reza hospital in Kermanshah, Iran, in 2017. The patients were randomly allocated into intervention and placebo groups. In the intervention group, TENS electrodes were placed on points Hegu and Zusanli. Pain severity was measured using the Care Pain Observation Tool scale, and the dosages of narcotics and sedation intake were recorded. Data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software, version 19. RESULTS: The level of pain in patients decreased in the intervention group in comparison with the sham group, and this decline was significant during certain hours (p < 0.05). The amount of analgesic and sedation drugs used was less significant in the intervention group than in the sham group (p = 0.01; p = 0.04).

#854,Comparison of acupuncture on specific and non-specific points for the treatment of painful temporomandibular disorders: A randomised controlled trial,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The aim of this single-centre, two-arm, parallel-group, double-blinded, randomised controlled trial was to investigate the disputed specific effectiveness of acupuncture by comparing acupuncture on specific and non-specific points among patients with non-chronic, painful TMDs. METHODS: Following predefined eligibility criteria, 49 consecutive patients of both sexes were recruited to the study. All subjects were diagnosed with a non-chronic (Graded Chronic Pain Scale grade <3) painful TMD, as assessed using the Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders (DC/TMD). Patients were randomly assigned to group A (acupuncture on specific points) or group B (acupuncture on non-specific points) after the initial examination (T0). Both acupuncture treatment sessions were conducted by a trained dentist once a week for four weeks. The examination was repeated five weeks (T5) after T0 by one calibrated examiner who was unaware of the study groups. Characteristic pain intensity (CPI) was evaluated as the main outcome criterion and compared between times and treatment groups by means of non-parametric tests (significance level set at P = .05). Secondary outcomes comprised the maximum corrected active mouth-opening without pain (MAO); patients' expectations regarding acupuncture treatment and pain development; depressivity; and oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL). RESULTS: A total of 41 patients (38 female) successfully completed the study (mean age: 40.17 ± 16.61). The two groups did not differ significantly at any time in terms of age and CPI. However, CPI was significantly (P < .05) lower at T5 than at T0 for both groups (29.66 and 30.35% lower in group A and group B, respectively). An increase in MAO was observed at T5 for both groups but was significant for group B only (P = .016). All patients had positive expectations of acupuncture therapy, and the two groups did not differ significantly at T5 with regard to the extent to which their expectations had been fulfilled by the treatment (P = .717). Comparison of T0 and T5 showed a statistically significant reduction of depressivity for group A (P = .0205), but no significant change for group B (P = .329). At T5, OHRQoL had improved significantly for both groups (group A, P = .018; group B, P < .001) compared with at T0.

The effect of acupuncture on painful TMD cannot be attributed to the specific point selection.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes
#861,Acupuncture Randomized Trials (ART) in patients with migraine or tension-type headache--design and protocols,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: We report the design and essentials of the protocols of two Acupuncture Randomized Trials (ART) investigating whether acupuncture is more efficacious than no treatment and minimal acupuncture in the interval treatment of migraine and tension-type headache. DESIGN: Randomized controlled multicenter trials with three treatment arms and a total observation period of 28 weeks. SETTING: 30 practitioners and outpatient units in Germany specialized in acupuncture treatment. PATIENTS: Per study 300 patients with migraine and episodic or chronic tension-type headache, respectively (diagnosis according to the criteria of the International Headache Society). INTERVENTIONS: Patients are randomly assigned to receive either (1) semi-standardized acupuncture (150 patients), (2) standardized minimal acupuncture (75 patients), or (3) no interval treatment for 12 weeks followed by semi-standardized acupuncture (75 patients, waiting list control). Acupuncture treatment consists of 12 sessions per patient over a period of 8 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Main outcome measure in the migraine trial is the difference between the number of days with headache of moderate or severe intensity during the 4 weeks before randomization and weeks 9 to 12 after randomization. In the study on tension-type headache the main outcome measure is similar to that described above, but for the number of headache days regardless of intensity. OUTLOOK: The results of these two studies (available in 2004) will provide health care providers and policy makers with the information needed to make scientifically sound assessments of acupuncture therapy.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#875,Nonpharmacological Interventions for Chronic Pain in Older Adults: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Gate control theory and fear-avoidance model of chronic pain posit that biopsychosocial factors can modulate pain. Nonpharmacological interventions are recommended in managing chronic pain, but little information is available regarding their efficacy in older adults. We examined and compared the efficacy of different nonpharmacological intervention approaches for chronic pain management among older adults via meta-analysis and subgroup analysis. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines (PROSPERO number CRD42020222767), a systematic search was undertaken using MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO up to March 21, 2022. Randomized controlled trials were included, and data were pooled using a random-effects meta-analysis model. Risk of bias was assessed using a quality rating scale for psychological interventions. RESULTS: Twenty-five trials (N = 2,394 participants) were identified. Six types of nonpharmacological interventions were compared with control conditions (sham/attention control and treatment as usual). Nonpharmacological interventions were associated with significant reductions in pain intensity, pain interference, depressive symptoms, catastrophizing beliefs, and improvement in physical performance (standardized mean differences -0.34 to 0.54). Subgroup analyses based on different nonpharmacological approaches revealed the benefits of psychological approaches combined with physical activity. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Nonpharmacological interventions, particularly those adopting psychological approaches and physical activity, have a small but statistically significant effect on chronic pain management in older adults. Reduction in pain interference may be related to reduced catastrophizing beliefs, thus providing support for the fear-avoidance model. Further research with adequate power is needed to establish the efficacy and mechanism of various intervention modalities for older adults.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#896,Naturopathic Oncology Care for Thoracic Cancers: A Practice Survey,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: There is a lack of information on therapies recommended by naturopathic doctors (NDs) for lung and gastroesophageal cancer care. Study objectives were to: (1) identify the most common interventions considered for use by NDs; (2) identify interventions NDs recommend to support key therapeutic goals; and (3) identify potential contraindications between integrative and conventional therapies. METHODS: Oncology Association of Naturopathic Physicians (OncANP) members (n = 351) were invited to complete an electronic survey. Respondents provided information on interventions considered for thoracic cancer pre- and postoperatively across 4 therapeutic domains (supplemental natural health products, physical, mental/emotional, and nutritional), therapeutic goals, and contraindications. This survey was part of the development of the Thoracic Perioperative Integrative Surgical Evaluation trial. RESULTS: Forty-four NDs completed the survey (12.5% response rate), all of whom were trained at accredited colleges in North America and the majority of whom were Fellows of the American Board of Naturopathic Oncology (FABNO) (56.8%). NDs identified significantly more interventions in the postoperative compared to preoperative setting. The most frequently identified interventions included modified citrus pectin, arnica, omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin D, probiotics, exercise, acupuncture, meditation, stress reduction, low glycemic index diet, and Mediterranean diet. Potential contraindications with conventional treatment (surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy) differed across natural health products. CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight naturopathic interventions with a high level of use in thoracic cancer care, describe and characterize therapeutic goals and the interventions used to achieve these goals, and provide insight on how practice changes relative to conventional cancer treatment phase.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#902,"Effectiveness of dry needling for the treatment of temporomandibular myofascial pain: a double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled study","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: To test the hypothesis that dry needling is more effective than sham dry needling in relieving myofascial pain of the temporomandibular muscles. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Fifty-two subjects with established myofascial trigger points were randomized into two groups; study group (N: 26) and placebo group (N: 26). Dry needling was applied using acupuncture needles. Sham dry needling was applied to the placebo group. Pain pressure threshold was measured with pressure algometry, pain intensity was rated using a 10-cm visual analog scale (VAS) and the unassisted jaw opening without pain measurement was performed. Evaluations were done by a physician blinded to the data. RESULTS: Of 52 patients assigned, 50 completed the study. Mean algometric values were significantly higher in the study group when compared to the placebo group (p values being less than 0.05). There were no differences between the two groups in terms of VAS and unassisted jaw-opening without pain values. CONCLUSION: Dry needling appears to be an effective treatment method in relieving the pain and tenderness of myofascial trigger points.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes
#911,Does acupuncture have additional value to standard poststroke motor rehabilitation?,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: A significant number of patients remain severely disabled after stroke despite rehabilitation with standard treatment modalities. Acupuncture has been reported as an alternative modality. This study aims to examine whether acupuncture has additional value to standard poststroke motor rehabilitation. METHODS: A prospective randomized controlled trial (RCT) was carried out in a stroke rehabilitation unit in Hong Kong. One hundred six Chinese patients with moderate or severe functional impairment were included at days 3 to 15 after acute stroke. They were stratified into the moderate and the severe groups before randomization into the control arm receiving standard modalities of treatment, which included physiotherapy, occupational and speech therapy, and skilled medical and nursing care, and the intervention arm receiving in addition traditional Chinese manual acupuncture. A mean of 35 acupuncture sessions on 10 main acupoints were performed over a 10-week period. Outcome measures included Fugl-Meyer assessment, Barthel Index, and Functional Independence Measure, respectively, at weeks 0, 5, and 10, performed by blinded assessors. RESULTS: At baseline, patients in each arm were comparable in all important prognostic characteristics. No statistically significant differences were observed between the 2 arms for any of the outcome measures at week 10 or outcome changes over time. CONCLUSIONS: Traditional Chinese manual acupuncture on the body has no additional value to standard poststroke motor rehabilitation.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes
#934,Sensory stimulation promotes normalization of postural control after stroke,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In a randomized study of hemiparetic stroke patients with a median age of 75 years, functional recovery was significantly better in those who received additional sensory stimulation (n = 38), including electrostimulation, than in control patients (n = 40) given the same physiotherapy and occupational therapy; group differences for balance, mobility, and activities of daily living were significant. The present study was designed to investigate postural control in patients who survived more than 2 years after stroke onset. METHODS: The 48 survivors (mean, 2.7 years; range, 2.0 to 3.8 years), 22 from the treatment group and 26 from the control group, were compared with 23 age-matched healthy subjects. Subjects were perturbed by vibrators applied to calf muscles or with galvanic vestibular stimulation. We evaluated postural control in terms of sway variances or sway velocities and the dynamics of postural control as a feedback system using system identification with a model previously validated for human postural control. RESULTS: Significantly more patients of the treatment group than of the control group maintained stance during perturbations (P < .01). Among patients capable of maintaining stance during perturbation, the control patients were characterized by significant divergence from normal values in two of the three characteristic parameters of dynamic postural control (ie, swiftness and stiffness; P < .05) compared with the treatment subgroup or age-matched subjects. CONCLUSIONS: The course of sensory stimulation enhanced recovery of postural function, an enhancement still significant 2 years after the lesion and treatment. The differences and near normalization of characteristic parameters of dynamic postural control among treated patients suggest that improved recovery after sensory stimulation may be achieved by patients regaining normal or near normal dynamics of human postural control.",No,No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No
#936,"Acupuncture and transcutaneous nerve stimulation in stroke rehabilitation: a randomized, controlled trial","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In small trials with control groups that receive no intervention, acupuncture has been reported to improve functional outcome after stroke. We studied effects of acupuncture and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation on functional outcome and quality of life after stroke versus a control group that received subliminal electrostimulation. METHODS: In a multicenter randomized controlled trial involving 7 university and district hospitals in Sweden, 150 patients with moderate or severe functional impairment were included. At days 5 to 10 after acute stroke, patients were randomized to 1 of 3 intervention groups: (a) acupuncture, including electroacupuncture; (b) sensory stimulation with high-intensity, low-frequency transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation that induces muscle contractions; and (c) low-intensity (subliminal) high-frequency electrostimulation (control group). A total of 20 treatment sessions were performed over a 10-week period. Outcome variables included motor function, activities of daily living function, walking ability, social activities, and life satisfaction at 3-month and 1-year follow-up. RESULTS: At baseline, patients in each group were closely similar in all important prognostic variables. At 3-month and 1-year follow-ups, no clinically important or statistically significant differences were observed between groups for any of the outcome variables. The 3 treatment modalities were all conducted without major adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS: When compared with a control group that received subliminal electrostimulation, treatment during the subacute phase of stroke with acupuncture or transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation with muscle contractions had no beneficial effects on functional outcome or life satisfaction.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No
#946,Battlefield acupuncture for post-partum pain: A randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Postpartum pain affects quality of life. Clinicians are increasingly using acupuncture for management of pain. Evidence based strategies that incorporate acupuncture for postpartum pain are lacking. METHODS: We performed an exploratory, randomized clinical trial of Battlefield Auricular Acupuncture (BFA) plus standard analgesia versus standard analgesia alone for reduction of pain in the immediate postpartum period. RESULTS: The mean time to 50% sustained reduction of initial pain in the standard analgesia group (n = 33) was 6 days compared to 5 days in the standard analgesia plus BFA (n = 37) group (p = 0.35). The mean total morphine equivalent units (MEUs) in the standard group compared to standard plus BFA group were 88 mg and 82 mg respectively (p = 0.45). CONCLUSIONS: This exploratory comparison suggests that BFA may not provide additional benefit to standard analgesia for immediate postpartum pain; however, the trend toward faster reduction in pain indicates that a larger definitive study may be required.",No,No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No
#953,Is acupuncture safe in the ICU? A systematic review and meta-analysis,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The safety of interventions for critically ill patients is a crucial issue. In recent years, several studies have treated critically ill patients with acupuncture. However, the safety of acupuncture in this setting remains to be systematically measured. METHODS: In May 2022, the electronic databases of PubMed and the Cochrane Library were searched for studies comparing acupuncture interventions to control interventions in critically ill patients. Study outcomes examined the incidence of severe adverse events (AEs), minor AEs, adverse reactions, ICU stays, and 28-day mortality. RESULTS: A total of 31 articles were analyzed, and no serious AEs related to acupuncture treatment were identified. No significant differences were found between the groups in the meta-analysis of minor AEs (risk ratio [RR] 5.69 [0.34, 96.60], P = 0.23, I(2) = 76%). A reduced risk in the incidence of adverse reactions following acupuncture intervention was evidenced (RR 0.33 [0.22, 0.50], P = 0.00001, I(2) = 44%). The patients in the acupuncture arm spent significantly less time in the intensive care unit (ICU) (Mean difference -1.45 [-11.94, -10.97], P = 0.00001, I(2) = 56%) and also exhibited lower 28-day mortality rates (odds ratio 0.61 [0.48, 0.78], P = 0.0001, I(2) = 0%). CONCLUSION: There is no evidence to indicate a higher risk of severe or minor AEs in patients who receive acupuncture. Acupuncture demonstrated favorable results in both ICU stay and 28-day mortality measurements, in addition to presenting with fewer adverse reactions compared to routine ICU care. However, the low certainty of the evidence resulting from a high risk of bias in the included studies merits substantial consideration, and further research is still warranted.

#959,Fostering cultural sensitivity amongst students of pharmacy through an interprofessional book club activity,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To describe a large-scale, cultural sensitivity-focused interprofessional book club activity that is required in the first-professional year of an accelerated pharmacy curriculum. EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITY AND SETTING: An interprofessional book club activity, focusing on the need for cultural sensitivity in health care, is conducted annually for students in the acupuncture, pharmacy, physical therapy, physician assistant, and sonography programs. Each year over 400 students are required to attend and are assigned to interprofessional groups to discuss guided questions pertaining to the book written by Anne Fadiman, The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down: A Hmong Child, Her American Doctors, and the Collision of Two Cultures. Pharmacy students complete multiple assignments before and after the activity. Students are administered a post-survey to collect student feedback and self-assessment data. The book club has been run in both synchronous and asynchronous formats. FINDINGS: Student survey responses have consistently revealed that the majority of students agreed or strongly agreed that they were better prepared for culturally-diverse patient interactions, the activity allowed for interprofessional learning, and the activity should continue for future students. SUMMARY: A book club activity is an effective strategy for delivering content related to cultural sensitivity in an interprofessional format. This activity model can be used to support interactions with multiple professions in different schools within the same university or with multiple professions located at different universities/institutions.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#991,Non-Invasive Auricular Acupoint Stimulation Improves Slow-Transit Constipation: Evidence From a Randomized Controlled Trial,"BACKGROUND Slow-transit constipation lacks optimal therapies due to the adverse effects and limited efficacy of current treatments. Auricular acupoint stimulation offers a potential adjunctive approach through neuromodulation, yet its clinical efficacy and mechanistic role in slow-transit constipation remain unestablished. MATERIAL AND METHODS Sixty patients diagnosed with slow-transit constipation, ranging in age from 40 to 75 years, were randomly allocated into 2 distinct cohorts: a study group and a control group. The study group, comprising 30 individuals, received a combination therapy of non-invasive auricular acupoint stimulation and prucalopride, while the control group, also consisting of 30 patients, was administered prucalopride as a monotherapy. To assess the efficacy of the interventions, various parameters were monitored, including serum levels of neuropeptide Y, nitric oxide, fecal water content, and gastrointestinal transit. The comparative therapeutic outcomes were determined by calculating symptom scores. RESULTS The study group exhibited a significantly higher overall efficacy rate (93.3%) compared to the control group (84.6%, P<0.05). Post-treatment assessments revealed a reduction in neuropeptide Y and nitric oxide levels in both cohorts, while colonic transit capacity and fecal water content showed an increase. Notably, the study cohort demonstrated a more pronounced decrease in neuropeptide Y and nitric oxide concentrations and a more substantial increase in colonic transit capacity and fecal water content compared to the control cohort (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS Non-invasive auricular acupoint stimulation significantly enhances symptom relief in patients with slow-transit constipation, suggesting its potential as a complementary therapy for constipation management.",No,No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No
#996,Efficacy and Safety of Acupuncture for Essential Hypertension: A Meta-Analysis,"BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of acupuncture therapy for patients with hypertension. MATERIAL AND METHODS We searched PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, and the Wan-fang Data Database from inception through 29 April 2017. Randomized controlled trials investigating acupuncture therapy for hypertension were included. Review Manager 5.3 software was used for the data analysis. RESULTS A total of 30 RCTs involving 2107 patients were included. The overall methodological quality of the included studies was low. Pooled results demonstrate that acupuncture plus anti-hypertensive drugs is better than anti-hypertensive drugs alone at reducing systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP). The same result was observed for pooled data from experiments that compared acupuncture plus medication to sham acupuncture plus medication at reducing SBP and DBP. However, studies reveal that using acupuncture alone or anti-hypertensive drugs alone do not differ in the effect on lowering blood pressure. Similarly, acupuncture alone also did not differ from sham acupuncture alone, and electroacupuncture versus anti-hypertensive drugs was not significantly different at reducing SBP and DBP. CONCLUSIONS Our systematic review indicates there is inadequate high quality evidence that acupuncture therapy is useful in treating hypertension, as the exact effect and safety of acupuncture therapy for hypertension is still unclear. Therefore, research with larger sample sizes and higher-quality RCTs is still needed.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#998,Comparative Evaluation of Electronic Acupuncture Pen and 2% Lignocaine Gel as an Intraoral Topical Anesthetic Agent in Children,"Background The most exasperating aspect for pediatric patients in a dental setup is the fear and anxiety caused by injections, called ""blenophobia"". There are numerous local anesthetic agents available to reduce the needle prick pain. Taking into consideration the paradigm shift, there is always a possibility for alternate treatment options. This study aimed to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) application through an electronic acupuncture pen (Meridian Energy Acupuncture Pen W-912 GENERIC) and 2% lignocaine gel as an intraoral topical anesthetic agent in children. Method Patients aged 6 to 12 years were eligible for inclusion. The topical anesthetic agents were administered to the patients in a bilateral split-mouth technique. In Group A, 2% topical anesthetic gel was administered on the first visit on one side of the mandible and topical anesthesia through the electronic acupuncture pen was administered on the next visit, on the opposite side of the mandible. The electronic acupuncture pen was applied on one side of the mandible on the first visit, and on the next appointment, 2% topical anesthetic gel on the other side was administered in Group B. Sound, eye, motor scale (SEM) and faces pain scale-Revised (FPS) were used as tools of evaluation after local anesthesia was administered.  Results  The comparison between electronic acupuncture pen and 2% lignocaine gel using the SEM scale shows a statistically insignificant difference (p-value = 0.082). Similarly, a comparison of FPS values between both groups indicates no significant difference (p-value = 0.582). However, results show a reduced pain perception in both groups. Conclusion Topical anesthetic agents are commonly used to reduce needle prick pain in children. TENS through the electronic acupuncture pen, a revisited aid in scientific research, has proved its efficacy as a topical pain reduction measure during dental treatment. This device overcomes the shortcomings of the anesthetic gels and also nullifies the chances of overdosage, hypersensitivity, and disagreeable taste. Thus, this tool can be used in dental practice for the management of pain in children.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#1003,Acupoint stimulation for fibromyalgia: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials,"Background. Acupoint stimulation is popular for treatment of fibromyalgia though there is lack of comprehensive evaluation of current clinical evidence for its effect and safety. Objective. To systematically review the beneficial effects and safety of acupoint stimulation for fibromyalgia. Methods. We searched six electronic databases for randomized trials on acupoint stimulation for treatment of fibromyalgia. Two authors extracted data and assessed the trial quality independently. RevMan 5.2 software was used for data analyses with effect estimate presented as (standard) mean difference and a 95% confidence interval. We defined minimum, medium, and large SMD effect sizes as 0.3, 0.5, and 0.75. Results. 16 RCTs with 1081 participants were involved in this review. Only two trials were evaluated as low risk of bias. Meta-analysis showed that acupuncture alone or combined with cupping therapy was superior to conventional medications on reducing pain scores and/or the number of tender points. However, acupuncture showed no better than sham acupuncture on pain reduction. There was no serious adverse event reported to be related to acupoint stimulation. Conclusions. Acupoint stimulation appears to be effective in treating fibromyalgia compared with medications. However, further large, rigorously designed trials are warranted due to insufficient methodological rigor in the included trials.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#1014,"A systematic review and meta-analysis of efficacy, cost-effectiveness, and safety of selected complementary and alternative medicine for neck and low-back pain","Background. Back pain is a common problem and a major cause of disability and health care utilization. Purpose. To evaluate the efficacy, harms, and costs of the most common CAM treatments (acupuncture, massage, spinal manipulation, and mobilization) for neck/low-back pain. Data Sources. Records without language restriction from various databases up to February 2010. Data Extraction. The efficacy outcomes of interest were pain intensity and disability. Data Synthesis. Reports of 147 randomized trials and 5 nonrandomized studies were included. CAM treatments were more effective in reducing pain and disability compared to no treatment, physical therapy (exercise and/or electrotherapy) or usual care immediately or at short-term follow-up. Trials that applied sham-acupuncture tended towards statistically nonsignificant results. In several studies, acupuncture caused bleeding on the site of application, and manipulation and massage caused pain episodes of mild and transient nature. Conclusions. CAM treatments were significantly more efficacious than no treatment, placebo, physical therapy, or usual care in reducing pain immediately or at short-term after treatment. CAM therapies did not significantly reduce disability compared to sham. None of the CAM treatments was shown systematically as superior to one another. More efforts are needed to improve the conduct and reporting of studies of CAM treatments.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#1017,"Acupoint application in patients with chronic stable angina pectoris: study protocol of a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial","Background. Chronic stable angina pectoris (CSAP) is a major syndrome of ischemic heart disease (IHD). CSAP manifests as chest pain or discomfort and affects patients' quality of life. Acupoint application (AP) has been reported to be effective for managing the symptoms of CSAP, but the evidence is not convincing. Therefore, we designed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of AP in the treatment of CSAP. Methods and Analysis. Two hundred participants with CSAP will be randomly assigned in a 1 : 1 : 1 : 1 ratio into 4 groups. All participants will receive 12 sessions of treatment in 4 weeks and the same basic treatment procedure. The participants will be visited and assessed for 12 weeks, including a 4-week screening, a 4-week treatment phase, and a 4-week follow-up phase. The primary outcome is the change in the total frequency of self-reported angina attack at 4th week compared with the baseline. The secondary outcomes include the intensity of angina pain, consumption of nitroglycerin or Suxiao Jiuxin pills, CCS angina classification, SAQ, SAS and SDS score. Ethics.

#1041,"""The Monkey on Your Shoulder"": A Qualitative Study of Lymphoedema Patients' Attitudes to and Experiences of Acupuncture and Moxibustion","Background. Lymphoedema, a distressing consequence of cancer treatment, has significant negative impact on health-related quality of life. Multidisciplinary approaches are needed to improve physical and psychosocial wellbeing. Acupuncture and moxibustion (acu/moxa), two modalities of traditional East Asian medicine, may contribute to improved outcomes for cancer survivors with lymphoedema. Aim. To explore how patients with lymphoedema secondary to cancer treatment perceive and experience acu/moxa treatment. Design and Setting. A qualitative focus group study, nested in a 3-step mixed methods observational study, was carried out in a cancer drop-in and information centre in north-west London. Methods. Six focus groups and one telephone interview were conducted with 23 survivors of breast or head and neck cancer, who had completed up to 13 acu/moxa treatments. Scripts were transcribed, coded, and analysed to identify salient and overarching themes. Results. Participants described feeling disempowered by cancer treatment and subsequent diagnosis of lymphoedema. Acu/moxa was valued for its whole-person approach and for time spent with a practitioner who cared, listened, and responded. Participants reported changes in physical and psychosocial health, including increased energy levels and reduced pain and discomfort, and feelings of empowerment, personal control, and acceptance. Many were motivated to improve self-care. Conclusion. Many participants who received acu/moxa treatment reported improved wellbeing and a more proactive attitude towards self-care.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#1046,Electroacupuncture at ST25 Inhibits Cisapride-Induced Gastric Motility in an Intensity-Dependent Manner,"Background. Previous studies have demonstrated the efficacy of frequency-specific EAS. However, evaluation of intensity-response effects is challenging and has yet to be addressed. Aims. Using cisapride to promote gastric emptying, we measured the intensity-response relationship of EA at ST25 on gastric motility. Methods. We determined the effects of EA at ST25 using intensities (0.5, 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 mA) on gastric motility in rats injected with cisapride (0.2, 0.02, and 0.002 mg/kg). Results. Utilizing three concentrations of cisapride yielded significantly differing levels of gastric motility. Furthermore, log IC50 values for EAS were different within each group. Given the same EA intensity, cisapride antagonism decreased progressively in each group as a function of drug concentration. The relative amount of cisapride antagonized by EAS did not change in a linear fashion. Finally, EAS at different intensities within the three groups induced a similar pattern of cisapride antagonism. Conclusions. The ability of EAS to elicit a decrease in cisapride-induced gastric motility pressure was demonstrated in this study. The study encompasses construct validity to mirror individualized treatment being based on patients' subjective feelings, not on a set fixed EA intensity. Clinically utilizing EAS at the smallest intensity can achieve the desired therapeutic effect.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#1056,Bilateral hegu acupoints have the same effect on the heart rate variability of the healthy subjects,"Background. The specificity of acupuncture points (acupoints) is one of the key concepts in traditional acupuncture theory, but the question of whether there is adequate scientific evidence to prove or disprove specificity has been vigorously debated in recent years. Acupoint laterality is an important aspect of acupoint specificity. Data is particularly scarce regarding the laterality of the same channel, namesake acupoint located on opposite sides of the body. Our previous study results suggest that Neiguan acupoint (PC6) has the laterality. The aim of this study was to investigate whether Hegu (LI4) also has laterality from the perspective of heart rate variability. Methods. A total of twenty-eight healthy female volunteers were recruited for this study and were randomly separated into the group I (n = 14) and the group II (n = 14) according to the register order. In the group I, left LI4 was stimulated in the first epoch and the right LI4 was stimulated in the second epoch. In the group II, right LI4 was stimulated in the first epoch and left LI4 was stimulated in the second epoch. Electrocardiogram was recorded and heart rate variability was analyzed. Results. The results show that there were no significant differences of heart rate variablity between the group I and the group II in the time domain and in the frequency domain. Conclusions. Bilateral Hegu acupoints have the same effect on the heart rate variability of the healthy subjects.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#1073,Prevention of propofol injection-related pain using pretreatment transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation,"Background/aim: This study aimed to study the effect of pretreatment transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation (TEAS) in preventing propofol injection-related pain. Materials and methods: A total of 360 patients who were to undergo elective hysteroscopy surgery were randomly divided into the following three groups of 120 patients each: control (Group C), sham TEAS (Group F), and TEAS (Group T). Patients in Group C did not undergo any treatment before surgery; 30 min before the induction of anesthesia, patients in Groups F and T underwent electrical stimulation of the bilateral LI4-PC6 acupoint. Patients in Group F were subjected to 'feeling flow', while those in Group T were subjected to 'tolerance flow.' The stimulation frequency was 2/100 Hz and the duration of stimulation was 30 min. After the induction of anesthesia, propofol injection-related pain scores, hemodynamic parameters, and adverse reactions were recorded. Results: Of the 360 patients, 324 completed the study. There were significant differences among the groups in terms of the incidence of moderate-to-severe pain. In terms of the four-point scaling method, the end of the radial vein, the cubital vein, and the 'back of the hand' vein differed significantly among the three groups (P = 0.05). Finally, using a numerical rating scale, a significant difference was observed among the three groups in terms of the pain scores in the different veins. Conclusions: Pretreatment TEAS effectively reduces the incidence and severity of propofol injection-related pain, the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting, and patient postoperative pain scores.",No,No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No
#1078,Electroacupuncture Regularizes Gastric Contraction and Reduces Apoptosis of Interstitial Cells of Cajal in Diabetic Rats,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Gastric dysmotility is a frequent complication among patients with diabetes mellitus. Electroacupuncture (EA) has been empirically used to relieve gastrointestinal symptoms. The aims of this study were to investigate the effects of EA on gastric contraction and the mechanisms of interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) involved. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized into the normal control, diabetes (DM), diabetic and sham EA (DM + SEA), diabetic and low-frequency EA (DM + LEA), and diabetic and high-frequency EA (DM + HEA) groups. Diabetic models were established and then treated with EA for 8 weeks. Body weight and blood glucose were recorded every 2 weeks. The spontaneous contractions of distal gastric strips were analyzed. Immunostaining and RT-PCR were used to test the apoptotic ICC, IGF-1/IGF-1R, and Nrf2/HO-1 pathways. RESULTS: The body weight in the DM + LEA and DM + HEA groups were increased compared with that of the DM group, though there was no effect on the blood glucose. The gastric contractions were obviously disordered in the DM group, but EA could regularize the contractions. The number of apoptotic ICC was dramatically increased in the DM group, but reduced with EA treatment. Meanwhile, the IGF-1/IGF-1R pathway was verified to be significantly altered in diabetic rats. The Nrf2/HO-1 pathway was not significantly increased in the DM group. EA with different frequencies efficiently improved the expression of IGF-1/IGF-1R signaling and activated the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway. CONCLUSION: EA could improve gastric motility dysfunction and attenuate ICC apoptosis possibly through the regulation of IGF-1/IGF-1R and Nrf2/HO-1 pathways. EA may be a potential therapeutic method for diabetic gastric motility dysfunction.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#1094,Feasibility and Acceptability of Integrating Acupuncture for Management of Multiple Symptoms in Medically Underserved Breast Cancer Survivors,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Breast cancer survivors undergoing long-term endocrine therapy often experience multiple symptoms, including pain, fatigue, sleep disturbance, hot flashes, anxiety, and depression. This study explored the feasibility and acceptability of integrating acupuncture for symptom management in medically underserved breast cancer survivors. METHODS: This randomized controlled trial was conducted at two clinics serving medically underserved populations. Breast cancer survivors (N = 62) were randomized to receive acupuncture (n = 31) or usual care (n = 31). The acupuncture group underwent 10 sessions over 5 weeks. Symptoms were assessed at baseline and Weeks 6 and 12. RESULTS: The majority of participants (55%) were Black, mean age was 55.2 ± 9.3 years, and 62.9% had a household income below $55,000. Retention (90.3%), engagement (93.1%), and acceptability (92.8%) rates were high, demonstrating that integrating acupuncture into care for medically underserved breast cancer survivors is both feasible and acceptable. At Week 6, the acupuncture group showed significant reduction compared to the usual care group in pain, fatigue, sleep disturbance, depression, anxiety, and the symptom cluster score. All improvements persisted to Week 12 except for those in anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: Integrating acupuncture for symptom management in medically underserved breast cancer survivors is both feasible and acceptable. This approach offers potential benefits for reducing multiple symptoms and addressing health disparities.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes
#1103,"Effect of Different Frequencies of Transcutaneous Electrical Acupoint Stimulation (TEAS) on EEG Source Localization in Healthy Volunteers: A Semi-Randomized, Placebo-Controlled, Crossover Study","Background/Objectives: Transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation (TEAS), also known as transcutaneous electroacupuncture stimulation, delivers electrical pulses to the skin over acupuncture points (""acupoints"") via surface electrodes. Electroencephalography (EEG) is an important tool for assessing the changes in the central nervous system (CNS) that may result from applying different TEAS frequencies peripherally-i.e., acting via the peripheral nervous system (PNS)-and determining how these influence cerebral activity and neural plasticity. Methods: A total of 48 healthy volunteers were allocated in a semi-randomized crossover study to receive four different TEAS frequencies: 2.5 pulses per second (pps); 10 pps; 80 pps; and sham (160 pps at a low, clinically ineffective amplitude). TEAS was applied for 20 min to each hand at the acupuncture point Hegu (LI4). The EEG was recorded during an initial 5 min baseline recording, then during TEAS application, and after stimulation for a further 15 min, separated into three periods of 5 min (initial, intermediate, and final) in order to assess post-stimulation changes. Source localization analysis was conducted for the traditional five EEG frequency bands: delta (0.1-3.9 Hz), theta (4-7.9 Hz), alpha (8-13 Hz), beta (14-30 Hz), and gamma (30.1-45 Hz). Results: Within-group source localization analyses of EEG data showed that during the initial 5 min post-stimulation, theta oscillations in the 2.5 pps TEAS group increased over the parahippocampal gyrus (t = 4.42, p < 0.01). The 10 pps TEAS group exhibited decreased alpha rhythms over the inferior parietal gyrus (t = -4.20, p < 0.05), whereas the sham (160 pps) TEAS group showed decreased delta rhythms over the postcentral gyrus (t = -3.97, p < 0.05). During the intermediate 5 min post-stimulation, the increased theta activity over the left parahippocampal gyrus (BA27) remained in the 2.5 pps TEAS group (t = 3.97, p < 0.05). However, diminished alpha rhythms were observed in the 10 pps TEAS group over the postcentral gyrus (t = -4.20, p < 0.01), as well as in the delta rhythms in the sham (160 pps) TEAS group in the same area (t = -4.35, p < 0.01). In the final 5 min post-stimulation, reduced alpha rhythms were exhibited over the insula in the 10 pps TEAS group (t = -4.07, p < 0.05). Interaction effects of condition by group demonstrate decreased alpha rhythms in the 10 pps TEAS group over the supramarginal gyrus during the initial 5 min post-stimulation (t = -4.31, p < 0.05), and decreased delta rhythms over the insula in the sham TEAS group during the final 5 min post-stimulation (t = -4.42, p < 0.01). Conclusions: This study revealed that low TEAS frequencies of 2.5 pps and 10 pps modulate theta and alpha oscillations over the brain areas related to emotional and attentional processes driven by external stimuli, as well as neural synchronization of delta rhythms in the sham group in brain areas related to stimulus expectation at baseline. It is hoped that these findings will stimulate further research in order to evaluate such TEAS modulation effects in clinical patients.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#1111,Laser Diode - GaAlAs Acupuncture in the Treatment of Central Obesity: a Randomized Clinical Trial,"BACKGROUND: : Obesity is a global health challenge. Traditional approaches, including increased physical activity, dietary interventions, and medical therapy, often yield limited success, propelling some patients toward costly and invasive procedures like bariatric surgery. Laser acupuncture has been suggested as a complementary therapeutic approach to overcome this challenge. The present study investigated the effectiveness of laser acupuncture treatment in weight loss and abdominal subcutaneous fat reduction. METHODS: : A randomized, blinded, sham-controlled clinical trial was conducted, with 30 subjects each in the intervention and control groups. Patients in the intervention group underwent 12 sessions of laser acupuncture treatment within a month (three sessions/week), whereas those in the control group received sham laser treatment on identical acupoints. The patients were instructed not to alter their physical activity levels or dietary regimens. All parameters were evaluated before and after the treatment. RESULTS: : Significant reductions in weight, body mass index, and waist circumference were noted in both intervention and control groups. Further analysis revealed a more significant decrease in the laser acupuncture group. Abdominal sonography revealed a marked decrease in periumbilical fat thickness in the intervention group. Conversely, laboratory evaluations showed no significant difference between the two groups. CONCLUSION: : Laser acupuncture is an effective method for weight loss in patients with periumbilical abdominal fat. The observed impact on subcutaneous fat suggests its potential as a non-invasive intervention for individuals seeking weight management alternatives. Further research is warranted to validate these findings and explore the underlying mechanisms of laser acupuncture in adipose tissue modulation.",No,No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No

#1143,Electro-acupuncture attenuates inflammatory responses and intraabdominal pressure in septic patients: A randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: A pathological increase in intraabdominal pressure (IAP) and inflammatory responses have negative effects on splanchnic, respiratory, cardiovascular, renal, and neurological function in septic patients with intestinal dysfunction. Electro-acupuncture (EA) has been evidenced to have a bidirectional neuron-endocrine-immune system regulating effect in patients with intestinal dysfunction. The purpose of current study was to evaluate the effects of EA at ""Zusanli"" (ST36) and ""Shangjuxu"" (ST37) on inflammatory responses and IAP in septic patients with intestinal dysfunction manifested syndrome of obstruction of the bowels Qi. METHODS: Eighty-two septic patients with intestinal dysfunction manifested syndrome of obstruction of the bowels Qi were randomly assigned to control group (n = 41) and EA group (n = 41). Patients in control group were given conventional therapies including fluid resuscitation, antiinfection, vasoactive agents, mechanical ventilation (MV), supply of enteral nutrition, and glutamine as soon as possible. In addition to conventional therapies, patients in EA group underwent 20-minutes of EA at ST36-ST37 twice a day for 5 days. At baseline, posttreatment 1, 3, and 7 days, serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and IAP levels, were measured, respectively. And days on MV, length of stay in intensive care unit (ICU) and 28 days mortality were recorded. RESULTS: The serum levels of TNF-α and IL-1β and IAP levels at posttreatment 1, 3, and 7 days were lower significantly in the EA group compared with the control group (mean [SD]; 61.03 [20.39] vs 79.28 [20.69]; P < .005, mean [SD]; 35.34 [18.75] vs 66.53 [30.43]; P < .005 and mean [SD]; 20.32 [11.30] vs 32.99 [20.62]; P = .001, respectively, TNF-α.

#1144,Effect of 100 Hz electroacupuncture on salivary immunoglobulin A and the autonomic nervous system,"BACKGROUND: A previous study has reported that low-frequency (LF) electroacupuncture (EA) influences salivary secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) and the autonomic nervous system (ANS). The ANS is known to control the secretion volume of sIgA; however, the effect of high-frequency (HF) EA on salivary sIgA has not been determined. We investigated whether HF EA affects salivary sIgA levels and the ANS. METHOD: Sixteen healthy subjects were randomly classified into two groups: a control group and an EA group. After a 5 min rest, subjects in the EA group received EA at 100 Hz bilaterally at LI4 and LI11 for 15 min before resting for a further 40 min post-stimulation. Subjects in the control group rested for a total of 60 min. Measurements of the ANS and sIgA levels in both groups were made before, immediately after, 20 min after, and 40 min after rest or 15 min EA treatment. HF and LF components of heart rate variability were analysed as markers of ANS function. LF/HF ratio and HF were taken as indices of sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve activity, respectively. Salivary protein concentrations and sIgA levels were determined by Bradford protein assay and ELISA, respectively. RESULTS: LF/HF ratio was significantly increased immediately after EA. HF was significantly increased at 20 min after EA and sIgA level was significantly increased at 40 min after EA. In addition, HF and salivary sIgA level were positively correlated with each another. CONCLUSIONS: HF EA exerted sequential positive effects on sympathetic nerve activity, parasympathetic nerve activity, and salivary sIgA level (immediately and after 20 and 40 min, respectively). HF EA may increase salivary sIgA levels by influencing parasympathetic nerve activity.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes
#1150,Group versus Individual Acupuncture (AP) for Cancer Pain: A Randomized Noninferiority Trial,"BACKGROUND: A service delivery model using group acupuncture (AP) may be more cost-effective than individual AP in general, but there is little evidence to assess whether group AP is a comparable treatment in terms of efficacy to standard individual AP. The study aimed to compare the group to individual delivery of 6-week AP among cancer patients with pain. METHODS: The study design was a randomized noninferiority trial of the individual (gold standard treatment) vs. group AP for cancer pain. The primary outcome was pain interference and severity, measured through the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI). Secondary outcomes included measures of mood, sleep, fatigue, and social support. Changes in outcomes from pre- to postintervention were examined using linear mixed effects modeling and noninferiority was inferred using a noninferiority margin, a difference of change between the two arms and 95% CIs. Pain interference was tested with a noninferiority margin of 1 on the BPI, while pain severity and secondary outcomes were compared using conventional statistical methods. RESULTS: The trial included 74 participants randomly allocated to group (35) or individual (39) AP. The noninferiority hypothesis was supported for pain interference [Ө - 1, Δ 1.03, 95% CI: 0.15-2.20] and severity [Ө - 0.81, Δ 0.52, 95% CI:.33-1.38] as well as for mood [Ө - 7.52, Δ 9.86, 95% CI: 0.85-18.86], sleep [Ө - 1.65, Δ 2.60, 95% CI: 0.33-4.88], fatigue [Ө 8.54, Δ - 15.57, 95% CI: 25.60-5.54], and social support [Ө.26, Δ - 0.15, 95% CI:  - 0.42-0.13], meaning that group AP was not inferior to individual AP treatment. Both arms evidenced statistically significant improvements across all symptoms before and after the intervention. Effect sizes for the group vs. individual AP on outcomes of pain, sleep, mood, and social support ranged from small to very large and were consistently larger in the group condition. The total average cost-per-person for group AP ($221.25) was almost half that of individual AP ($420). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to examine the noninferiority of group AP with the gold standard individual AP. Group AP was noninferior to individual AP for treating cancer pain and was superior in many health outcomes. Group AP is more cost-effective for alleviating cancer pain and should be considered for implementation trials.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes
#1171,Evaluating the clinical application and effect of acupuncture therapy in anal function rehabilitation after low-tension rectal cancer surgery,"BACKGROUND: According to the indexes of serum and anal function, acupuncture therapy was applied to patients with low rectal cancer in order to avoid the occurrence of anal incontinence and reduce complications. AIM: To explore the clinical application and evaluate the effect of acupuncture therapy for anal function rehabilitation after low-tension rectal cancer surgery. METHODS: From the anorectal surgery cases, we selected 120 patients who underwent colorectal cancer surgery between January 2020 and December 2022 and randomly divided them into a control group (n = 60), observation group (n = 60), and control group after surgery for lifestyle intervention (including smoking cessation and exercise), dietary factor adjustment, anal movement, and oral loperamide treatment. The serum levels of motilin, 5-hydroxytryptamine, and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), Wexner score for anal incontinence, and incidence of complications were compared between groups. RESULTS: After treatment, the VIP and 5-hydroxytryptamine levels in the observation group were lower than those in the control group (P < 0.05). The motilin level was higher than that in the control group (P < 0.05). Postoperative anal incontinence was better in the observation group than in the control group (P < 0.05). The incidence of complications in the observation group was 6.67%, which was significantly lower than that in the control group (21.67%; P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Acupuncture therapy has a positive effect on the rehabilitation of anal function after low-tension rectal cancer surgery; it can effectively help to improve the serum indices of patients, avoid the occurrence of anal incontinence, and reduce the incidence of complications.

#1190,Polyglycolic acid sutures embedded in abdominal acupoints for treatment of simple obesity in adults: a randomized control trial,"BACKGROUND: Acupoint catgut embedding therapy characterized by acupoint, needle and catgut are superior to traditional acupuncture, due to exerting more comprehensive therapeutic efficacy. However, it is still deficient in clinical evidence for polyglycolic acid sutures, a novel biodegradable material instead of catgut, embedded for the treatment of simple obesity. In our study, we investigate the efficacy and related mechanism of polyglycolic acid sutures embedded in abdominal acupoints on simple obese persons by a randomized control trial. METHODS: A total of 51 eligible participators were randomly allocated to a polyglycolic acid sutures embedding therapy (PASET) group (n = 28) or control group (n = 23). Participators in PASET group received polyglycolic acid sutures alternatively embedded in abdominal I group and II group acupoints in odd and even number therapeutic courses, and participators in control group were required to perform lifestyle modification. The duration of the study was 10 weeks. RESULTS: It suggested that PASET significantly reduced weight, body mass index, hip circumference, waist circumference, waist/hip ratio, waist-to-height ratio and thickness of abdominal subcutaneous fat tissue compared with those before treatment (p < 0.01), but lifestyle modification only illustrated downward trend of weight (p < 0.05). Moreover, PASET group also improved the evaluated scores in aspects of physical function, self-esteem, public distress and sexual life, as well as decreased blood pressure, glycemia, low density lipoprotein, uric acid and the levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1β, and increased high density lipoprotein in comparison with those before treatment (p < 0.05), whose efficacies are superior to control group. Additionally, our results also indicate PASET is relative safe and its pain and discomfort can be tolerable. CONCLUSIONS: PASET distinctly ameliorates anthropometric data and quality of life in obese population, which associates with improvements of metabolic profile and inflammatory response. Based on the advantageous actions, we think PASET is an effective therapeutic approach to simple obesity treatment.Trial registration ChiCTR, ChiCTR1800015591.

This study evaluates the diversity and safety of acupotomy procedures for lumbar spine disorders to aid in developing safety and reporting guidelines for clinical studies. Methods: A literature search was conducted on 30 October 2023 in PubMed, five Korean databases, and relevant journals with keywords like 'low back pain' and 'acupotomy'. The search included clinical trial articles in English or Korean on lumbar spinal disorders treated by acupotomy. We reviewed 22 clinical studies involving 731 Korean patients published from 2008 to 2023. Data extracted included disease types, diagnosis methods, treatment specifics, needling factors, anesthesia, clinical outcomes, and safety reports. Results: Most studies focused on lumbar herniated discs and stenosis, with acupotomy performed on damaged tissue sites. Treatment frequency varied, and outcomes included pain scales and imaging assessments. Reporting gaps were found in needle size, insertion depth, and anesthesia status. Safety measures were poorly documented, with only six studies addressing safety and two reporting adverse events. Conclusions: There is a critical need for standardized clinical and reporting guidelines for acupotomy, akin to acupuncture's existing guidelines, to enhance research consistency and quality.

#1234,Acupuncture with Moxibustion at Conception Vessel 17 on Pulmonary Functions in Patients with Asthma: A Randomized Placebo-Controlled Study,"BACKGROUND: Acupuncture and moxibustion are used worldwide for treating various diseases including asthma. Conception Vessel 17 (CV-17) is the influential point for the respiratory tissues. It is commonly used in the management of asthma. However, there are no known studies that report the effect of needling with moxibustion at CV-17 alone in asthma patients. Thus, this study aimed to examine the effect of acupuncture and moxibustion at CV-17 on pulmonary functions in asthma patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this randomized placebo-controlled study, a total of sixty participants with asthma were recruited from a medical college and hospital located in Chennai, India. All the recruited participants were randomly assigned to either the acupuncture with moxibustion group (AMG) or placebo control group (PCG). AMG received needling with moxibustion at the CV-17 acupuncture point, while PCG received needling with moxibustion at a non-acupuncture point for 20 minutes once a day, daily for 2 weeks. RESULTS: Within-group analysis showed a significant increase in forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expired volume in 1s (FEV1), FEV1/FVC ratio, forced expiratory flow (FEF)25-75%, and peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) in AMG, whereas PCG showed a significant increase in only FEV1, FEV1/FVC ratio, and FEF25-75%. Furthermore, the increase in FVC, FEV1, FEV1/FVC, and PEFR were greater in AMG than PCG. None of the participants reported any serious adverse effects during the study period.

#1235,Warm-needling acupuncture and medicinal cake-separated moxibustion for hyperlipidemia: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Acupuncture and moxibustion has been widely applied to hyperlipidemia treatment in clinical practice in China, serving as an alternative treatment to statins. Warm-needling acupuncture and medicinal cake-separated moxibustion have been separately reported with potential therapeutic effects on hyperlipidemia treatment in several studies but with limitations in study methodology. Combining these two modalities may provide a more advantageous strategy in treating hyperlipidemia. Therefore, a strict evaluation through well-designed randomized controlled trials (RCT) is necessary to determine their efficacy and safety on hyperlipidemia. METHODS: The study a multicenter, open-label, randomized, stratified, active-controlled, noninferiority trial with two parallel groups. Subjects with hyperlipidemia will be stratified into different groups by risk levels of heart diseases. They then will be instructed to the Therapeutic Lifestyle Change (TLC) diet. Those who have not reached the target lipid level will be randomly assigned to the treatments of either acupuncture and moxibustion or simvastatin with a 1:1 allocation. One hundred and thirty subjects are aimed to be recruited. The duration of intervention for this study will be 12 weeks, followed by another 4 weeks for post-treatment assessment. The primary outcome is percentage change from baseline to the end of the study in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Other indicators in lipid change, safety and adherence will also be assessed secondarily. The repeated measures, linear mixed-effects model will be applied to the analysis. DISCUSSION: Acupuncture and moxibustion could be a potentially effective treatment alternative for hyperlipidemia. A study with careful design is developed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of combined acupuncture and moxibustion, by integrating the traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) regimens with the standardized Western medicine appraisal approach.

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to compare the effects of myofascial meridian stretching exercises and acupuncture in patients with low back pain. METHODS: We randomized 81 subjects with acute/subacute low back pain into three groups: an acupuncture (A) group, a myofascial meridian stretching (MMS) group, and a control (C) group. We recorded the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) and Roland- Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMQ) scores at baseline and weeks two and six. We evaluated posterior pelvic tilt and transversus abdominis muscle strenghth with a pressure biofeedback unit, back extensor muscle strength by the Sorenson test, and lumbar range of motion (ROM) with an inclinometer. Group A received acupuncture (BL 57 and BL 62 acupoints) and stretching exercises according to the posterior superficial line were applied to the MMS group. RESULTS: Improvements in the NRS score were more prominent in group A than in group C (p = 0.004). The RMQ score improvement between baseline and weeks two and six was more prominent in groups A and MMS (p < 0.001, p = 0.001, respectively). The Sorenson test showed significant improvement between the baseline and week two in groups A and MMS (p = 0.004, p < 0.001, respectively). The increase in lumbar ROM measurement in the MMS group between baseline and week two was significantly higher than in groups A and C (p = 0.009, p < 0.001, respectively).

#1258,Acupuncture for the treatment of sudden sensorineural hearing loss: A systematic review and meta-analysis: Acupuncture for SSNHL,"BACKGROUND: Acupuncture as an alternative treatment method is widely used in the treatment of sudden sensorineural hearing loss(SSNHL) in China. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the clinical efficacy of acupuncture for the management of SSNHL patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure and WanFang databases were searched. Searches were performed on April 27, 2018 and without language and publication year restrictions. We collected and analyzed the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of acupuncture for the treatment of SSNHL patients to assess its efficacy and safety. The RevMan5.3 software was used for analysis. The fixed-effects model can be applied to calculate the risk ratio (RR) or weighted mean difference (WMD) if the chi-square test shows there was no significance of heterogeneity (p > 0.10, I(2)<50%). Otherwise, the random effects mode was used. RESULTS: Twenty randomized controlled trials met our inclusion criteria. The electroacupuncture(EA), manual acupuncture(MA) plus western medicine(WM) and EA plus WM groups lead to significantly better pure tone audiometry(PTA) than WM alone in cured rate (P = 0.01; P < 00,001; P < 0.006, respectively). However, no significant differences were observed between MA and WM (p = 0.27). In terms of total effective rate, all of them showed significant improvement compared to WM alone (MA: P = 0.03; EA: P = 0.01; MA + WM: P < 0.00001; EA + WM: P = 0.04). In addition, no significant difference was found between the MA plus WM and WM alone groups in the improvement of tinnitus (P = 0.37). No trials reported serious adverse events. CONCLUSION: Acupuncture could be a valid treatment option for SSNHL, especially for patients who could not be cured by drugs alone. However, the outcome was limited temporarily due to the lack of high-quality research support. High-quality evidence is needed to clarify the future efficacy and safety of acupuncture for SSNHL.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#1294,Electroacupuncture for Women with Chronic Severe Functional Constipation: Subgroup Analysis of a Randomized Controlled Trial,"BACKGROUND: Acupuncture has been found to be effective for treating chronic constipation. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this exploratory study was to evaluate the efficacy of electroacupuncture (EA) in the subgroup of women with chronic severe functional constipation. METHODS: This is a subgroup analysis of the multicenter, randomized, sham-acupuncture (SA) controlled trial. The efficacy of 822 (76%) female patients of the 1075 randomized patients with chronic severe functional constipation was evaluated. Patients were randomly assigned to receive 28 sessions of EA or SA over 8 weeks with 12 weeks' follow-up. This study focused on sustained complete spontaneous bowel movements (CSBMs) responders over the 8-week treatment. RESULTS: The primary outcome which was percentage of the sustained CSBMs responders for the subset of women with severe constipation was significantly higher in the EA group (24.3%) than in the SA group (8.1%) with difference of 13.1% (95%CI, 6.5% to 19.7%; P<0.001). As for the secondary outcomes, responders for ≥9 of 12 weeks of follow-up were higher in the EA group than in the SA group. Additionally, EA had significantly better improvement in mean weekly CSBMs, mean weekly spontaneous bowel movements (SBMs), and mean score changes of stool consistency and straining as well as quality of life of patients. The incidence of adverse events (AEs) related to acupuncture was rare and no statistical significance was found between two groups. CONCLUSION: EA improved the spontaneity and the completeness of the bowel movement of women with severe functional constipation during 8-week treatment and the effect sustained for 12 weeks after stopping treatment.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes
#1308,Pain and sensory detection threshold response to acupuncture is modulated by coping strategy and acupuncture sensation,"BACKGROUND: Acupuncture has been shown to reduce pain, and acupuncture-induced sensation may be important for this analgesia. In addition, cognitive coping strategies can influence sensory perception. However, the role of coping strategy on acupuncture modulation of pain and sensory thresholds, and the association between acupuncture sensation and these modulatory effects, is currently unknown. METHODS: Electroacupuncture (EA) was applied at acupoints ST36 and GB39 of 61 healthy adults. Different coping conditions were experimentally designed to form an active coping strategy group (AC group), who thought they could control EA stimulation intensity, and a passive coping strategy group (PC group), who did not think they had such control. Importantly, neither group was actually able to control EA stimulus intensity. Quantitative sensory testing was performed before and after EA, and consisted of vibration (VDT), mechanical (MDT), warm (WDT), and cold (CDT) detection thresholds, and pressure (PPT), mechanical (MPT), heat (HPT) and cold (CPT) pain thresholds. Autonomic measures (e.g. skin conductance response, SCR) were also acquired to quantify physiological response to EA under different coping conditions. Subjects also reported the intensity of any acupuncture-induced sensations. RESULTS: Coping strategy was induced with successful blinding in 58% of AC subjects. Compared to PC, AC showed greater SCR to EA. Under AC, EA reduced PPT and CPT. In the AC group, improved pain and sensory thresholds were correlated with acupuncture sensation (VDTchange vs. MI: r=0.58, CDTchange vs. tingling: r=0.53, CPTchange vs. tingling; r=0.55, CPTchange vs. dull; r=0.55). However, in the PC group, improved sensory thresholds were negatively correlated with acupuncture sensation (CDTchange vs. intensity sensitization: r=-0.52, WDTchange vs. fullness: r=-0.57). CONCLUSIONS: Our novel approach was able to successfully induce AC and PC strategies to EA stimulation. The interaction between psychological coping strategy and acupuncture sensation intensity can differentially modulate pain and sensory detection threshold response to EA. In a clinical context, our findings suggest that instructions given to the patient can significantly affect therapeutic outcomes and the relationship between acupuncture intensity and clinical response. Specifically, acupuncture analgesia can be enhanced by matching physical stimulation intensity with psychological coping strategy to acupuncture contexts.

#1315,A randomized double blind comparison of real and placebo acupuncture in IVF treatment,"BACKGROUND: Acupuncture has been used during IVF treatment as it may improve outcome, however, there are concerns about the true efficacy of this approach. This randomized double blind study aimed to compare real acupuncture with placebo acupuncture in patients undergoing IVF treatment. METHODS: On the day of embryo transfer (ET), 370 patients were randomly allocated to either real or placebo acupuncture according to a computer-generated randomization list in sealed opaque envelopes. They received 25 min of real or placebo acupuncture before and after ET. The endometrial and subendometrial vascularity, serum cortisol concentration and the anxiety level were evaluated before and after real and placebo acupuncture. RESULTS: The overall pregnancy rate was significantly higher in the placebo acupuncture group than that in the real acupuncture group (55.1 versus 43.8%, respectively, P = 0.038; Common odds ratio 1.578 95% confidence interval 1.047-2.378). No significant differences were found in rates of ongoing pregnancy and live birth between the two groups. Reduction of endometrial and subendometrial vascularity, serum cortisol concentration and the anxiety level were observed following both real and placebo acupuncture, although there were no significant differences in the changes in all these indices between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Placebo acupuncture was associated with a significantly higher overall pregnancy rate when compared with real acupuncture. Placebo acupuncture may not be inert.

#1329,Effect of acupuncture on long-term outcomes in patients with post-stroke dysphagia,"BACKGROUND: Acupuncture has been used to treat patients with post-stroke neurological dysfunction. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of our observational study was to observe the long-term efficacy of acupuncture and investigate whether the acupuncture treatment could short the recovery time of patients with post-stroke dysphagia. METHODS: Medical records were reviewed to select patients who met the inclusion criteria for post-stroke dysphagia. Exposure factor was defined as received acupuncture during inpatient. Clinical data were obtained at the 6-month follow-up. The primary outcome was the time to improve the score of Food Intake Level Scale (FILS, 0-10) by 3 grades. Cox regression models were used to assess the relationship between acupuncture and recovery of dysphagia. RESULTS: In acupuncture group, the median time to achieve clinical improvement of dysphagia was 97 days (95% CI, 93-124) compared with 119 days (95% CI, 108-145) in control group, with a statistically significant difference between the two groups (HR = 1.48; 95% CI 1.14-1.92; P = 0.003). At 6 months, 78 patients (60.5%) in acupuncture group reached excellent function and 61 patients (47.3%) in control group (RR = 1.28; 95% CI, 1.02-1.62; P = 0.045). 106 patients (82.2%) in acupuncture group achieved favorable function and 91 patients (70.5%) in control group (RR = 1.17; 95% CI, 1.02-1.35; P = 0.039). The outcome of adjusted multivariable Cox regression models showed that there was a difference in the recovery time of dysphagia between groups, HR = 1.79, 95% CI 1.34-2.39. The rates of adverse events were similar in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Acupuncture can promote the recovery of post-stroke dysphagia, and has a better long-term efficacy. Besides, it can reduce the degree of disability and improve the quality of life.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#1337,Acupuncture for acute low back pain: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"BACKGROUND: Acupuncture has been widely used for acute low back pain (LBP), yet there remains continued controversy regarding its efficacy. Therefore, we aimed to critically evaluate the evidence for acupuncture as an effective treatment for acute LBP. METHODS: English and Chinese databases were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that involved acupuncture for acute LBP published up to May 2020. Data on the outcomes of pain intensity, functional status, and analgesic use were extracted. The meta-analysis was performed using the Cochrane Collaboration's RevMan 5.3, and pooled data were expressed as mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Of the 13 eligible RCTs identified, 11 RCTs (involving 707 patients) provided moderate-quality evidence that acupuncture has a statistically significant association with improvements in VAS (visual analog scale) score [MD: -1.75 (95% CI: -2.39, -1.12)]. Two studies indicated that acupuncture did not influence the RMDQ (Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire) scores more than the control treatment [MD: -2.34 (95% CI: -5.34, 0.67)]. Three studies suggested that acupuncture influenced the ODI (Oswestry Disability Index) scores more than the control treatment [MD: -12.84 (95% CI: -23.94, -1.74)]. Two studies suggested that acupuncture influenced the number of pills more than the control treatment [MD: -3.19 (95% CI: -3.45, -2.92)]. CONCLUSIONS: Acupuncture treatment of acute LBP was associated with modest improvements in the VAS score, ODI score, and the number of pills, but not the RMDQ score. Our findings should be considered with caution due to the low power original studies. High-quality trials are needed to assess further the role of acupuncture in the treatment of acute LBP.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No

#1371,Effect of acupuncture on tic disorder: a randomized controlled clinical trial based on energy metabolomics and infrared thermography,"BACKGROUND: Acupuncture is a method for treating tic disorder. However, there is a lack of sufficient clinical objective basis in regards of its treatment efficacy. Indeed, there are structural abnormalities present in energy metabolism and infrared thermography in children with tic disorder. Therefore, this study proposes a clinical trial scheme to explore the possible mechanism of acupuncture in treating tic disorder. METHODS: This randomized controlled trial will recruit a total of 90 children, in which they will be divided into non-intervention group and intervention group. The non-intervention group consists of 30 healthy children while the intervention group consists of 60 children with tic disorder. The intervention group will be randomly allocated into either the treatment group or the control group, with 30 children randomly assigned in each group. Children either received acupuncture treatment and behavioral therapy (treatment group) or sham acupuncture treatment and behavioral therapy (control group), 3 treatment sessions per week for a period of 12 weeks, with a total of 36 treatment sessions. Outcome measures include YGTSS, urinary and fecal metabolomics, infrared thermography of body surface including governor vessel. For the intervention group, these outcome measures will be collected at the baseline and 90th day prior to intervention. Whereas for the non-intervention group, outcome measures (excluding YGTSS) will be collected at the baseline. DISCUSSION: The main outcome will be to observe the changes of the severity of tic condition, the secondary outcome will be to observe the changes of structural characteristic of infrared thermography of body surface/acupoints along the governor vessel and to evaluate the changes of urinary and fecal metabolomics at the end of the treatment, so as to analyze the relationship between them and to provide further knowledge in understanding the possible mechanism of acupuncture in improving the clinical symptoms via regulating and restoring the body metabolomics network, which in future it can develop as a set of clinical guideline (diagnosis, treatment, assessment, prognosis) in treating tic disorder.

#1411,[Acupuncture for back pain: meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials and an update with data from the most recent studies],"BACKGROUND: Acupuncture is commonly used to treat back pain. A meta-analysis of clinical trials of acupuncture for this condition came to a positive conclusion whilst a qualitative review was negative. AIM: To compare our meta-analysis of trials of acupuncture for the treatment of back pain with a qualitative review and the most recent studies on the subject. METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted to retrieve all randomised controlled trials of any form of acupuncture for any type of back pain in humans. The adequacy of the acupuncture was assessed by consulting six experienced acupuncturists. The main outcome measure for the meta-analysis was numbers of subjects who where improved at the end of treatment. These data are discussed in relation to the qualitative review and the most recent studies. RESULTS: Twelve studies were included of which nine presented data suitable for meta-analysis. The odds ratio of improvement with acupuncture compared with control intervention was 2.30 (95% confidence interval 1.28 to 4.13). For sham-controlled, evaluator-blinded studies, the odds ratio was 1.37 (95% confidence interval, 0.84-2.25). The results from the majority of the most recent studies also support the effectiveness of acupuncture in the treatment of back pain.

#1415,Acupuncture for migraine prophylaxis: a randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Acupuncture is commonly used to treat migraine. We assessed the efficacy of acupuncture at migraine-specific acupuncture points compared with other acupuncture points and sham acupuncture. METHODS: We performed a multicentre, single-blind randomized controlled trial. In total, 480 patients with migraine were randomly assigned to one of four groups (Shaoyang-specific acupuncture, Shaoyang-nonspecific acupuncture, Yangming-specific acupuncture or sham acupuncture [control]). All groups received 20 treatments, which included electrical stimulation, over a period of four weeks. The primary outcome was the number of days with a migraine experienced during weeks 5-8 after randomization. Our secondary outcomes included the frequency of migraine attack, migraine intensity and migraine-specific quality of life. RESULTS: Compared with patients in the control group, patients in the acupuncture groups reported fewer days with a migraine during weeks 5-8, however the differences between treatments were not significant (p > 0.05). There was a significant reduction in the number of days with a migraine during weeks 13-16 in all acupuncture groups compared with control (Shaoyang-specific acupuncture v. control: difference -1.06 [95% confidence interval (CI) -1.77 to -0.5], p = 0.003; Shaoyang-nonspecific acupuncture v. control: difference -1.22 [95% CI -1.92 to -0.52], p < 0.001; Yangming-specific acupuncture v. control: difference -0.91 [95% CI -1.61 to -0.21], p = 0.011). We found that there was a significant, but not clinically relevant, benefit for almost all secondary outcomes in the three acupuncture groups compared with the control group. We found no relevant differences between the three acupuncture groups. INTERPRETATION: Acupuncture tested appeared to have a clinically minor effect on migraine prophylaxis compared with sham acupuncture.

#1426,Acupuncture for pain relief in labour: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"BACKGROUND: Acupuncture is frequently used for pain relief in labour, but the evidence is not clear. OBJECTIVES: To critically evaluate the evidence for or against acupuncture for labour pain management. SEARCH STRATEGY: Nineteen electronic databases, including English, Korean, Japanese, and Chinese databases, were systematically searched. SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving women receiving acupuncture alone, or as an adjunct to conventional analgesia, for pain relief in labour were considered. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Pain intensity on a 100-mm visual analogue scale (VAS; 0, no pain; 100, worst pain) and use of other analgesic methods were used as primary outcomes, and for statistical pooling. Maternal/fetal outcomes were secondary outcomes, and adverse events were also recorded. Risk of bias was assessed regarding randomisation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting, and other biases. MAIN RESULTS: Ten RCTs involving 2038 women were included. VAS for pain intensity data were available in seven studies; the meta-analysis shows that acupuncture was not superior to minimal acupuncture at 1 hour (pooled mean difference -8.02; 95% CI -21.88, 5.84; I(2) = 94%) and at 2 hours (-10.15; 95% CI -23.18, 2.87; I(2) = 92%). Patients reported significantly reduced pain by 4 and 6% during electroacupuncture (EA) treatment at 15 (-4.09; 95% CI -8.05, -0.12) and 30 minutes (-5.94; 95% CI -9.83, -2.06), compared with placebo EA, but the effect was not maintained afterwards. Compared with no intervention, acupuncture reduced pain by only 11% for the first 30 minutes (-10.56; 95% CI -16.08, -5.03). In trials where acupuncture was compared with conventional analgesia, women receiving acupuncture required less meperidine (pooled risk ratio 0.20; 95% CI 0.12, 0.33) and other analgesic methods (0.75; 95% CI 0.66, 0.85). No acupuncture-related adverse events were reported. Most trials did not blind participants, care providers and/or evaluators.

Further research seems warranted.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#1452,Acupuncture for schizophrenia: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"BACKGROUND: Acupuncture is one of the most popular types of complementary/alternative medicine. It is sometimes used as a treatment for schizophrenia. AIMS: The objective of this review is to assess systematically the clinical evidence for or against acupuncture as a treatment for schizophrenia. METHODS: We searched 20 databases from their inception to May 2009 without language restrictions. All randomised clinical trials (RCTs) of acupuncture, with or without electrical stimulation or moxibustion for patients with schizophrenia were considered for inclusion. RESULTS: Thirteen RCTs, all originating from China, met the inclusion criteria. One RCT reported significant effects of electroacupuncture (EA) plus drug therapy for improving auditory hallucunations and positive symptom compared with sham EA plus drug therapy. Four RCTs showed significant effects of acupuncture for response rate compared with antipsychotic drugs [n = 360, relative risk (RR): 1.18, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.03-1.34, p = 0.01; heterogeneity: tau(2) = 0.00, chi(2) = 2.98, p = 0.39, I(2) = 0%]. Seven RCTs showed significant effects of acupuncture plus antipsychotic drug therapy for response rate compared with antipsychotic drug therapy (n = 457, RR: 1.15, 95% CI: 1.04-1.28, p = 0.008, heterogeneity: tau(2) = 0.00, chi(2) = 6.56, p = 0.36, I(2) = 9%). Two RCTs tested laser acupuncture against sham laser acupuncture. One RCT found beneficial effects of laser acupuncture on hallucination and the other RCT showed significant effects of laser acupuncture on response rate, Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale and clinical global index compared with sham laser. The methodological quality was generally poor and there was not a single high quality trial. CONCLUSION: These results provide limited evidence for the effectiveness of acupuncture in treating the symptoms of schizophrenia. However, the total number of RCTs, the total sample size and the methodological quality were too low to draw firm conclusions. As all studies originated from China, international studies are needed to test whether there is any effect.",Yes,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#1454,Acupuncture vs intravenous morphine in the management of acute pain in the ED,"BACKGROUND: Acupuncture is one of the oldest techniques to treat pain and is commonly used for a large number of indications. However, there is no sufficient evidence to support its application in acute medical settings. METHODS: This was a prospective, randomized trial of acupuncture vs morphine to treat ED patients with acute onset moderate to severe pain. Primary outcome consists of the degree of pain relief with significant pain reduction defined as a pain score reduction ≥50% of its initial value. We also analyzed the pain reduction time and the occurrence of short-term adverse effects. We included in the protocol 300 patients with acute pain: 150 in each group. RESULTS: Success rate was significantly different between the 2 groups (92% in the acupuncture group vs 78% in the morphine group P<.001). Resolution time was 16±8 minutes in the acupuncture group vs 28±14 minutes in the morphine group (P<.005). Overall, 89 patients (29.6%) experienced minor adverse effects: 85 (56.6%) in morphine group and 4 (2.6%) in acupuncture group (P<.001). No major adverse effects were recorded during the study protocol. In patients with acute pain presenting to the ED, acupuncture was associated with more effective and faster analgesia with better tolerance. CONCLUSION: This article provides an update on one of the oldest pain relief techniques (acupuncture) that could find a central place in the management of acute care settings. This should be considered especially in today's increasingly complicated and polymedicated patients to avoid adverse drug reactions.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes
#1456,Acupuncture for smoking cessation,"BACKGROUND: Acupuncture is promoted as a treatment for smoking cessation, and is believed to reduce withdrawal symptoms. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this review is to determine the effectiveness of acupuncture in smoking cessation in comparison with: a) sham acupuncture b) other interventions c) no intervention. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group trials register, Medline, PsycLit, Dissertation Abstracts, Health Planning and Administration, Social SciSearch, Smoking & Health, Embase, Biological Abstracts and DRUG. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised trials comparing a form of acupuncture with either sham acupuncture, another intervention or no intervention for smoking cessation. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We extracted data in duplicate on the type of subjects, the nature of the acupuncture and control procedures, the outcome measures, method of randomisation, and completeness of follow-up. We assessed abstinence from smoking at the earliest time-point (before 6 weeks), at six months and at one year follow-up in patients smoking at baseline. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence for each trial, and biochemically validated rates if available. Those lost to follow-up were counted as continuing to smoke. Where appropriate, we performed meta-analysis using a fixed effects model. MAIN RESULTS: We identified 18 publications involving 20 comparisons. Acupuncture was not superior to sham acupuncture in smoking cessation at any time point. The odds ratio (OR) for early outcomes was 1.22 (95% confidence interval 0.99 to 1.49); the OR after 6 months was 1.38 (95% confidence interval 0.90 to 2.11) and after 12 months 1.02 (95% confidence interval 0.72 to 1.43). Similarly, when acupuncture was compared with other anti-smoking interventions, there were no differences in outcome at any time point. Acupuncture appeared to be superior to no intervention in the early results, but this difference was not sustained. The results with different acupuncture techniques do not show any one particular method (i.e. auricular acupuncture or non-auricular acupuncture) to be superior to control intervention. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: There is no clear evidence that acupuncture is effective for smoking cessation.",No,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#1462,Acupuncture as palliative therapy for physical symptoms and quality of life for advanced cancer patients,"BACKGROUND: Acupuncture is underutilized as an adjunct cancer therapy. The main study objectives were to determine the feasibility of administering acupuncture as palliative therapy to patients with advanced ovarian or breast cancer and to assess the effect on symptoms and quality of life (QOL). METHODS: This study was a pilot, single-armed prospective clinical trial for patients with advanced cancer to receive 12 acupuncture sessions over 8 weeks with follow-up at weeks 9 and 12. Ambulatory patients with advanced ovarian or breast cancer were enrolled to receive treatments at an outpatient academic oncology center. Symptom severity was measured before and after each acupuncture session.A composite QOL assessment tool, consisting of validated instruments, was completed at 5 time points. RESULTS: Forty patients enrolled in the study. Twenty-eight patients (70%; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 53%-83%) completed 4 weeks of treatment, and 26 patients (65%; 95% CI = 48%-79%) completed 8 weeks. Eight patients (20%) withdrew before receiving acupuncture, and 6 patients (15%) discontinued treatment early because of disease progression or scheduling demands. Among all 32 assessed patients, there was self-reported improvement immediately post-treatment in anxiety,fatigue, pain, and depression and significant improvement over time for patients with anxiety (P = .001) and depression(P = .02). Among patients experiencing baseline symptoms, there was improvement in anxiety (P = .001), fatigue (P = .0002),pain (P = .0002), and depression (P = .003). QOL measures of pain severity and interference, physical and psychological distress, life satisfaction, and mood states showed improved scores during treatment, with sustained benefit at 12 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study demonstrates that an 8-week outpatient acupuncture course is feasible for advanced cancer patients and produces a measurable benefit that should be evaluated in controlled trials.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#1475,Acupuncture for primary fibromyalgia: Study protocol of a randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Acupuncture is well recognized for its unique therapeutic effect for many diseases as a nonpharmacological therapy in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). However, whether acupuncture can effectively treat fibromyalgia is currently unclear. Therefore, we aim to design a study protocol of a randomized controlled clinical trial and assess the effectiveness of acupuncture for patients with fibromyalgia, which may lead to alleviation of clinical symptoms and improvement of patients' quality of life. METHODS: The study is designed as a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled trial of two cohorts conducted at Guang'anmen Hospital of China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences and Shenzhen Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital, respectively. A total of 68 patients with primary fibromyalgia, diagnosed with the American College of Rheumatology criteria, are randomly allocated with a 1:1 ratio to acupuncture or sham acupuncture groups. All subjects will receive acupuncture intervention for 8 weeks with follow-up assessments every 4 weeks for 16 weeks. The primary outcome will be evaluated using the visual analogue scale (VAS) and revised fibromyalgia impact questionnaire (FIQR) for pain intensity. The secondary outcome measures will include: Multidimensional Assessment of Fatigue scale (MAF), Short Form-36 (SF-36), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Chinese perceived stress scales (pss-14), changes in the number of 18 tender points, patient satisfaction for the treatment and adverse events. The mentioned outcome measurements will be assessed every 4 weeks for 6 months.

#1482,Efficacy of electro-acupuncture and manual acupuncture versus sham acupuncture for knee osteoarthritis: statistical analysis plan for a randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Acupuncture is widely used for knee osteoarthritis (KOA), despite contradictory evidence. This study is designed to determine the efficacy of electro-acupuncture and manual acupuncture versus sham acupuncture for KOA. METHODS/DESIGN: This is a multi-center three-arm randomized controlled trial. It will enroll 480 participants with KOA in China. Participants will be randomly assigned 1:1:1 to receive 24 sessions of electro-acupuncture, manual acupuncture, or sham acupuncture over 8 weeks. The primary outcome is the response rate, which is the proportion of patients who achieve the minimal clinically important improvement in pain and function at 8 weeks. The primary outcome will be analyzed using the Z-test with the intention-to-treat set. Secondary outcomes include pain, function, global patient assessment, and quality of life. Full details of the statistical analysis plan for the primary and secondary outcomes will be described in this article. The statistical analysis plan was written and submitted without knowledge of the study data. DISCUSSION: The data will be analyzed according to this pre-specified statistical analysis plan to avoid data-driven analysis and to enhance the transparency of the trial. The aim of the trial is to provide high-quality evidence on the efficacy of acupuncture for KOA. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov, NCT03366363 .

#1501,Effectiveness and Safety of Acupuncture for Vascular Cognitive Impairment: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Background: Acupuncture may be a promising complementary therapy for vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) and has been extensively applied in China. However, its potential effects remain uncertain, and the clinical findings are inconsistent. This review aimed to systematically appraise the overall effectiveness and safety of acupuncture in treating VCI. Methods: To investigate the effects of acupuncture on VCI from inception to February 28, 2021 using randomized clinical trials (RCTs), seven electro-databases [Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed, Embase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), VIP, and Wanfang] were searched. Two independent investigators identified the eligible RCTs and extracted data into predesigned forms. The risk of bias (ROB) within each individual trial was evaluated using the Cochrane Collaboration's tool. Meta-analyses were conducted for calculating comparative effects in the RevMan software (version 5.3). The strength of attained evidence was rated using the online GRADEpro approach. Results: A total of 48 RCTs involving 3,778 patients with VCI were included. The pooled data demonstrated that acupuncture was more beneficial for a global cognitive function [mean difference (MD) 1.86, 95% CI 1.19-2.54, p < 0.01] and activities of daily living (MD -3.08, 95% CI -4.81 to -1.35, p < 0.01) compared with western medicine (WM). The favorable results were also observed when acupuncture was combined with WM (MD 2.37, 95% CI 1.6-3.14, p < 0.01) or usual care (UC, MD 4.4, 95% CI 1.61-7.19, p = 0.002) in comparison with the corresponding control conditions. Meanwhile, the subgroup analysis did not indicate a statistical effect difference between manual acupuncture (MA) and electroacupuncture (EA) (inter-group I (2) < 50% and p > 0.1) when comparing acupuncture with WM. There were no significant differences in the occurrence of adverse events (AEs) between the acupuncture group and the control group (p > 0.05). Owing to the poor methodological quality and considerable heterogeneity among studies, the certainty of the evidence was low or very low. Conclusions: This review suggests that acupuncture as a monotherapy or an adjuvant therapy may play a positive role in improving the cognition and daily performance of VCI patients associated with few side effects. The difference in styles may not significantly influence its effectiveness. More rigorously designed and preregistered RCTs are highly desirable to verify the therapeutic benefits and determine an optimal acupuncture paradigm. The methodological and reporting quality of future researches should be enhanced by adhering to authoritative standardized statements.

#1542,Mast cell deficiency attenuates acupuncture analgesia for mechanical pain using c-kit gene mutant rats,"BACKGROUND: Acupuncture therapy plays a pivotal role in pain relief, and increasing evidence demonstrates that mast cells (MCs) may mediate acupuncture analgesia. The present study aims to investigate the role of MCs in acupuncture analgesia using c-kit gene mutant-induced MC-deficient rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: WsRC-Ws/Ws rats and their wild-type (WT) littermates (WsRC-+/+) were used. The number of MCs in skin of ST36 area was compared in two rats after immunofluorescence labeling. Mechanical withdrawal latency (MWL), mechanical withdrawal threshold (MWT), and thermal withdrawal latency (TWL) were measured on bilateral plantar for pain threshold evaluation before and after each stimulus. Acupuncture- and moxibustion-like stimuli (43°C, 46°C heat, 1 mA electroacupuncture [EA], 3 mA EA, and manual acupuncture [MA]) were applied randomly on different days. RESULTS: Fewer MCs were observed in the skin of ST36 in mutant rats compared to WT rats (P<0.001). For pain thresholds, MWL and MWT were higher in WsRC-Ws/Ws compared to WsRC-+/+ on bilateral paws (P<0.05), but TWL was not different between the two rats (P>0.05). Bilateral MWL and MWT in WsRC-+/+ rats increased significantly after each stimulus compared to baseline (P<0.01, P<0.001). In WsRC-Ws/Ws rats, only noxious stimuli could produce anti-nociceptive effects for mechanical pain (46°C, 3 mA EA, MA) (P<0.01, P<0.001). Additionally, the net increases in MWL and MWT induced by most stimuli were greater in WT than in mutant rats (P<0.05). For thermal nociception, either high- or low-intensity stimuli could significantly augment TWL in two rats (P<0.001), and the net increases of TWL evoked by most stimuli were to the same extent in two genetic variants. CONCLUSION: MCs influence the basic mechanical but not thermal pain threshold. MCs participate in acupuncture analgesia in mechanical but not in thermal nociception, in that MC deficiency may attenuate the mechanical analgesia evoked by high-intensity stimuli and eliminate analgesia provoked by low-intensity stimuli.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#1544,Effects of acupuncture therapy on insomnia,"BACKGROUND: Acupuncture therapy, commonly used in clinical practice in oriental cultures, has the potential to produce a positive effect with patients experiencing insomnia. AIM: The purposes of this systematic review were: (1) to assess the trends across intervention studies using acupuncture for insomnia from 1975 to 2002, (2) to examine dependent variables, and (3) to evaluate the effects of acupuncture therapy on insomnia in older people. METHOD: Data were collected from November 2001 to January 2003. A wide range of electronic databases was searched using the keywords 'insomnia', 'acupuncture' and 'experimental design'. Papers were included if they were published in the English language between 1975 and 2002 and described an experimental study using acupuncture therapy to treat insomnia. Eleven reports met these criteria. FINDINGS: Most of the studies had been conducted since 1990. The findings showed that the first author was usually a Chinese medical doctor (n = 9) employed in a traditional department of medicine. Most of the papers were published in two journals: International Journal of Clinical Acupuncture and Journal of Traditional Chinese Medicine. Data were limited because of the small number of studies available. Half the studies had small samples (50 subjects or fewer), which were composed mainly of older women who had a variable duration of insomnia from 3 days to 34 years. The main method used to assess outcomes was questionnaire. All the studies reported statistically significant positive results. CONCLUSION: The results of this review suggest that acupuncture may be an effective intervention for the relief of insomnia. Further research, using a randomized clinical trial design, are necessary to determine the effectiveness of acupuncture. More work is also needed to promote the long-term therapeutic effects of acupuncture and to compare it with other therapies for insomnia.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#1546,Meta-Analysis of Electroacupuncture in Cardiac Anesthesia and Intensive Care,"BACKGROUND: Acupuncture treatment has been employed in China for over 2500 years and it is used worldwide as analgesia in acute and chronic pain. Acupuncture is also used in general anesthesia (GA). The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess the efficacy of electroacupuncture (EA) in addition to GA in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. METHODS: We searched 3 databases (Pubmed, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science-from 1965 until January 31, 2017) for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) including patients undergoing cardiac surgery and receiving GA alone or GA + EA. As primary outcomes, we investigated the association between GA + EA approach and the dosage of intraoperative anesthetic drugs administered, the duration of mechanical ventilation (MV), the postoperative dose of vasoactive drugs, the length of intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital stay, and the levels of troponin I and cytokines. RESULTS: The initial search yielded 477 citations, but only 7 prospective RCTs enrolling a total of 321 patients were included. The use of GA + EA reduced the dosage of intraoperative anesthetic drugs (P < .05), leading to shorter MV time (P < .01) and ICU stay (P < .05) as well as reduced postoperative dose of vasoactive drugs (P < .001). In addition, significantly lower levels of troponin I (P < .01) and tumor necrosis factor α (P < .01) were observed. CONCLUSION: The complementary use of EA for open-heart surgery reduces the duration of MV and ICU stay, blunts the inflammatory response, and might have protective effects on the heart. Our findings stimulate future RCT to provide definitive recommendations.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#1563,Acupuncture-assisted embryo transfer techniques: Research frontiers and future directions,"BACKGROUND: Acupuncture, an ancient practice, is gaining recognition as a complementary and alternative medicine, especially in assisted reproductive technology. It plays a crucial role in enhancing embryo transfer success rates. Research indicates that acupuncture can improve blood flow, increase endometrial receptivity regulate pressure, and affect neuroendocrine activities in the ovaries and uterus during embryo implantation, therefore improving pregnancy outcomes. AIM: To highlight recent developments related to acupuncture's influence on embryo transfer and elucidating the precise mechanisms by which acupuncture influences embryo transfer. METHODS: We searched database including PubMed, Cochrane Library up to September 2024 for relevant studies and patents to evaluate the effects of acupuncture on women undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF). The experimental design included an intervention group using needling, and a control group consisting of no needling or sham needling. The main outcome is clinical pregnancy rate (CPR), while secondary includes live birth rate (LBR) and biochemical pregnancy rate (BPR). We examined the influence of adjunctive needling on pregnancy outcomes by analyzing variations in the main outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 145 randomized controlled trials involving 27748 participants were analyzed. Data revealed that the overall CPR was significantly elevated in all acupuncture cohorts compared to the control group [relative risk (RR): 1.21, 95%CI: 1.07-1.38, P = 0.01]. In contrast, the aggregated LBR did not exhibit a corresponding increase, and notable statistical heterogeneity was observed among the studies. Acupuncture-assisted frozen-thawed embryo transfer enhanced the BPR (RR: 1.51, 95%CI: 1.21-1.89, P = 0.03) and improved endometrial morphology (RR: 1.41, 95%CI: 1.13-1.75, P = 0.01). Furthermore, IVF outcomes were significantly superior in the acupuncture group when acupuncture was administered during controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (RR: 1.71, 95%CI: 1.08-2.13, 95%CI: 1.08-4.21, P = 0.03). CONCLUSION: We find that acupuncture positively influences pregnancy rates in women receiving IVF treatment. Nonetheless, there are no established guidelines for optimal acupuncture protocols. Considering the methodological limitations identified in current research, there is a need for larger, methodologically rigorous studies.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#1635,Effect of acupuncture therapy combined with fluticasone propionate in the treatment of persistent allergic rhinitis: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Allergic rhinitis (AR) is an immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated inflammatory response. Persistent allergic rhinitis (PAR) is a subtype of AR, but the treatment of PAR is still a problem. Acupuncture is used as an alternative therapy for AR in clinical practice. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of acupuncture therapy combined with fluticasone propionate nasal spray in comparison to fluticasone propionate nasal spray alone in the relief of symptoms for PAR. METHODS: This study is a multicenter, single-blind, randomized controlled trial. A total of 260 eligible patients will be randomly assigned into the treatment group or the control group. The treatment group will receive the nasal fluticasone propionate combined with acupuncture, and the control group will receive fluticasone propionate nasal spray alone for 6 weeks. The primary outcome is the change in the Reflective Total Nasal Symptom Score (rTNSS) from baseline to the end of treatment, and the Total Non Nasal Symptom Score (TNNSS), reflective total ocular symptom score (rTOSS), Rhinitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ), use of antiallergic drugs, and the Rhinitis Control Assessment Test (RCAT) are used as secondary outcomes. The participants will be followed up for another 24 weeks after treatment. DISCUSSION: This clinical trial will be able to provide high level evidence on the acupuncture therapy combined with fluticasone propionate nasal spray in the treatment of PAR.

#1651,Predictors of Pain Reduction in Trials of Interventions for Aromatase Inhibitor-Associated Musculoskeletal Symptoms,"BACKGROUND: Almost one-half of aromatase inhibitor (AI)-treated breast cancer patients experience AI-associated musculoskeletal symptoms (AIMSS); 20%-30% discontinue treatment because of severe symptoms. We hypothesized that we could identify predictors of pain reduction in AIMSS intervention trials by combining data from previously conducted trials. METHODS: We pooled patient-level data from 3 randomized trials testing interventions (omega-3 fatty acids, acupuncture, and duloxetine) for AIMSS that had similar eligibility criteria and the same patient-reported outcome measures. Only patients with a baseline Brief Pain Inventory average pain score of at least 4 of 10 were included. The primary outcome examined was 2-point reduction in average pain from baseline to week 12. Variable cut-point selection and logistic regression were used. Risk models were built by summing the number of factors statistically significantly associated with pain reduction. Analyses were stratified by study and adjusted for treatment arm. RESULTS: For the 583 analyzed patients, the 4 factors statistically significantly associated with pain reduction were Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Functional Well-Being greater than 24 and Physical Well-Being greater than 14 (higher scores reflect better function), and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index less than 50 and Modified Score for the Assessment and Quantification of Chronic Rheumatoid Affections of the Hands less than 33 (lower scores reflect less pain). Patients with all 4 factors were greater than 6 times more likely to experience at least a 2-point pain reduction (odds ratio = 6.37, 95% confidence interval = 2.31 to 17.53, 2-sided P < .001); similar results were found for secondary 30% and 50% pain reduction endpoints. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with AIMSS who have lower symptom and functional distress at study entry on AIMSS intervention trials are more likely to experience meaningful pain reduction. Baseline symptom and functional status should be considered as stratification factors in future interventional trials.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No
#1678,Acupuncture and dry-needling for low back pain,"BACKGROUND: Although low-back pain is usually a self-limiting and benign disease that tends to improve spontaneously over time, a large variety of therapeutic interventions are available for its treatment. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of acupuncture for the treatment of non-specific low-back pain and dry-needling for myofascial pain syndrome in the low-back region. SEARCH STRATEGY: We updated the searches from 1996 to February 2003 in CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE. We also searched the Chinese Cochrane Centre database of clinical trials and Japanese databases to February 2003. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized trials of acupuncture (that involves needling) for adults with non-specific (sub)acute or chronic low-back pain, or dry-needling for myofascial pain syndrome in the low-back region. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers independently assessed methodological quality (using the criteria recommended by the Cochrane Back Review Group) and extracted data. The trials were combined using meta-analyses methods or levels of evidence when the data reported did not allow statistical pooling. MAIN RESULTS: Thirty-five RCTs were included; 20 were published in English, seven in Japanese, five in Chinese and one each in Norwegian, Polish and German. There were only three trials of acupuncture for acute low-back pain. They did not justify firm conclusions, because of small sample sizes and low methodological quality of the studies. For chronic low-back pain there is evidence of pain relief and functional improvement for acupuncture, compared to no treatment or sham therapy. These effects were only observed immediately after the end of the sessions and at short-term follow-up. There is evidence that acupuncture, added to other conventional therapies, relieves pain and improves function better than the conventional therapies alone. However, effects are only small. Dry-needling appears to be a useful adjunct to other therapies for chronic low-back pain. No clear recommendations could be made about the most effective acupuncture technique. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The data do not allow firm conclusions about the effectiveness of acupuncture for acute low-back pain. For chronic low-back pain, acupuncture is more effective for pain relief and functional improvement than no treatment or sham treatment immediately after treatment and in the short-term only. Acupuncture is not more effective than other conventional and ""alternative"" treatments. The data suggest that acupuncture and dry-needling may be useful adjuncts to other therapies for chronic low-back pain. Because most of the studies were of lower methodological quality, there certainly is a further need for higher quality trials in this area.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#1684,Danggui-Shaoyao-San for dementia: A PRISMA-compliant systematic review and meta-analysis,"BACKGROUND: Although memory loss and other symptoms of dementia pose tremendous burdens on patients and societies, there is currently no cure for dementia. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the anti-dementia effects of Danggui-Shaoyao-San (DSS), which is derived from natural resources. We searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from inception to June 2019. We searched PubMed, Embase, Korean databases (Research Information Service System and Oriental Medicine Advanced Searching Integrated System), Chinese databases (China Knowledge Resource Integrated Database and Wanfang Database), and Japanese databases (CiNii and J-STAGE). Studies were included if they were a RCT, investigated the efficacy of DSS or its modified form, and included participants with dementia. Use of DSS with other treatment (eg, acupuncture, anti-dementia drugs, etc) was included. Items of each trial were evaluated by 2 independent reviewers. Data were pooled by using random-effect models. RESULTS: A total of 482 studies were identified, and 5 eligible studies for Alzheimer disease (AD) and 4 studies for vascular dementia (VD) were included in the final analysis, representing a total of 567 participants. As for AD, pooled results of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) (mean differences [MD] 4.60; 95% confidence interval [CI] 4.29, 4.91) and activities of daily living (MD 11.40; 95% CI 10.94, 11.86) favored DSS. DSS had synergistic effect with acupuncture over acupuncture alone in MMSE (MD 1.69; 95% CI 1.05, 2.34), Hasegawa Dementia Scale (MD.62; 95% CI -0.20, 1.44), and activities of daily living (MD 2.38; 95% CI 1.92, 2.85). In VD, pooled results showed a significant difference in the score of dementia scales such as MMSE and Hasegawa Dementia Scale compared with nootropic drugs. DSS significantly reduced symptoms (odds ratio 5.02, 95%, CI 2.76-9.11) in patients with VD. The respective size of each RCTs was small and some included studies were of low quality due to their limited description on methodological issues. CONCLUSION: These estimates suggest that DSS provides clinically important reductions in symptoms of AD and VD and can be a promising anti-dementia drug candidate.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#1685,Effectiveness of acupuncture as auxiliary combined with Western medicine for epilepsy: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"BACKGROUND: Although more and more clinical studies have shown that acupuncture as an auxiliary combined with Western medicine is effective in the treatment of patients with epilepsy, no systematic reviews of acupuncture as a treatment for epilepsy have been published. Hence, we conducted this meta-analysis to evaluate the effect of acupuncture treatment on patients with epilepsy. METHODS: This study retrieved randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of acupuncture treatment for epilepsy from various electronic databases including PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese BioMedical Literature Database, and Wangfang database. These studies evaluated the effectiveness of acupuncture as an auxiliary treatment combined with Western medicine for patients with epilepsy. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed using the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. RESULTS: A total of 17 RCTs involving a total of 1,389 participants were included. The results showed that acupuncture combined with Western medicine improved the effective rates of treatment (OR: 4.28; 95% CI: 3.04-6.02; p < 0.001), and reduced the seizure frequency of patients (SMD: -3.29; 95% CI: -3.51 to -3.07; p < 0.001) and the EEG discharge frequency (SMD: -5.58; 95% CI: -7.02 to -4.14; p < 0.001). Regarding the quality of life and adverse events, the acupuncture group was superior to the control group in improving the overall quality of life of patients with epilepsy (SMD: 14.41; 95% CI: 12.51-16.32; p < 0.001) and decreased adverse events (OR: 0.38; 95% CI: 0.23-0.63, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The results of the analysis suggested that acupuncture combined with Western medicine is probably helpful in patients with epilepsy, but strong supportive data are not yet available. Given that this study is based on a low to moderate evidence-based analysis, the conclusions should be viewed with caution. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: PROSPERO, identifier no.

#1691,Cardioprotective effect of acupuncture for percutaneous coronary intervention-related myocardial injury in patients with coronary artery disease: A protocol for systematic review and meta-analysis,"BACKGROUND: Although patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) rely increasingly upon percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), this therapy causes subsequent the complications of myocardial injury. Acupuncture safely protects the heart from ischemic injury; however, the efficacy of acupuncture for periprocedural myocardial injury after PCI remains unclear. METHODS: Seven databases in English and Chinese including PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Embase, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Wanfang Database will be searched. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that use acupuncture to treat PCI-related myocardial injury in patients with CAD, regardless of blinding. The crossover randomized trials will be included, but only the pre-crossover data will be analyzed to avoid carryover effects. We will exclude non-RCTs, qualitative studies, uncontrolled clinical trials, and laboratory studies. The measurement of concentration of cardiac troponin (T or I) and MB isoenzyme of creatine kinase will be used as primary outcome. Postprocedural cardiac function and the major adverse cardiac/cerebrovascular event rate will be assessed as secondary outcome. Relevant data were collected independently by 2 reviewers and the third reviewer was responsible for resolving discrepancies through discussion. The Review Manager V.5.3.3 s will be used to perform the data synthesis and subgroup analysis. DISCUSSION: This systematic review and meta-analysis would provide convincing evidence of various types of acupuncture that specifically focuses on cardioprotective effect of acupuncture on PCI-related myocardial injury.

#1702,"Heat-sensitive moxibustion self-administration in patients in the community with primary hypertension: A protocol for a multi-center, pragmatic, non-randomized trial","BACKGROUND: Although the efficacy of antihypertensive drugs has been well established for primary hypertension, their effectiveness is always limited by side effects and poor compliance. Heat-sensitive moxibustion is an innovative acupoint stimulation therapy that is promising as a community health care intervention for hypertension. AIMS: This study aims to evaluate the pragmatic effectiveness and safety of heat-sensitive moxibustion self-administration by patients in the community with primary hypertension. METHODS: This study will adopt a multi-center, pragmatic, nonrandomized design. Six hundred patients with primary hypertension will be recruited from 4 communities. Each patient will choose to either receive heat-sensitive moxibustion self-administration + original antihypertensive drugs or maintain their original antihypertensive drugs without heat-sensitive moxibustion for 1 year. EXPECTED OUTCOMES: The primary outcome will be changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressures and the percentage changes in the doses of antihypertensive drugs. The secondary outcomes will be changes in quality of life assessed by a validated patient-reported outcome scale and the levels of fasting blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin, total cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, urinary albumin, and serum creatinine. The proportion of patients with poor compliance with the heat-sensitive moxibustion regimen will also be evaluated as a secondary outcome. The safety of heat-sensitive moxibustion will be considered by analyzing the incidence of all and serious adverse events and their correlation with heat-sensitive moxibustion. DISCUSSION: The findings of this study will provide pragmatic evidence for heat-sensitive moxibustion self-administration in patients in the community with primary hypertension and may also establish an ethical basis for further randomized controlled trials.

#1710,A comparison of physician and nonphysician acupuncture treatment for chronic low back pain,"BACKGROUND: Although up to a third of the 10,000 acupuncturists in the United States are medical doctors, little is known about the acupuncture techniques they use or how their practices compare with those of nonphysician licensed acupuncturists. This is the first study providing descriptive data on physician acupuncture and comparison to nonphysician acupuncture. PURPOSE: This study describes how a random sample of physician acupuncturists in the United States diagnose and treat chronic low back pain and contrasts their practices with those of nonphysician licensed acupuncturists. METHODS: A total of 464 questionnaires were mailed to physician acupuncturists randomly sampled from 3 sources: web-based Yellow Pages, American Academy of Medical Acupuncturists (AAMA) membership, and Pain Clinics associated with American College of Graduate Medical Education-approved fellowship programs. Responses (n=137, 30%) were analyzed using descriptive statistics. The results of this survey were compared with data published from a similar survey of nonphysician licensed acupuncturists in Washington State. RESULTS: Physicians who perform acupuncture use a mixture of styles and emphasize neuroanatomic approaches to needle placement. Most physicians received training in French Energetic acupuncture. In contrast, most nonphysician licensed acupuncturists use a traditional Chinese medicine approach to needle placement. Despite this apparent difference in their predominant styles of acupuncture, there was a high correlation between physician and nonphysician licensed acupuncturist acupoint selection to treat low back pain. In addition to acupuncture needling, physicians use other medical treatments, whereas nonphysician licensed acupuncturists' employ a variety of traditional Chinese medicine adjuncts to needling. CONCLUSION: This study provides new information about the nature of physician acupuncture practice in the United States and how it compares to acupuncture provided by nonphysician licensed acupuncturists. Further research is necessary to determine if the different types of acupuncture provided by physicians and nonphysician acupuncturists affect treatment outcomes and costs for patients with chronic low back pain.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No

The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility and effect of delivering transcutaneous electrical acupuncture stimulation (TEAS) intervention to elders with aMCI. METHODS: A total of 61 aMCI patients were randomly allocated into the intervention group (receiving a 12-week TEAS) and control group (receiving health education). The feasibility outcomes included recruitment rate, retention rate, adherence rate, and an exploration of patients' views and suggestions on the research. The effective outcomes included cognitive function, sleep quality, and life quality, which were measured by the Montreal cognitive assessment scale (MoCA), auditory verbal learning test-Huashan version (AVLT-H), Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI), and quality of life short-term-12 (QoL SF-12). RESULTS: The recruitment rate, retention rate, and adherence rate were 67.35%, 92.42%, and 85.29%, respectively. Most aspects of the research design and administration of the TEAS intervention were acceptable. The quantitative analysis suggests that compared with the control group, the scores of MoCA, AVLT-H, and SF-12 (mental component summary) were significantly better (p < 0.05); however, the differences were not statistically significant in PSQI and SF-12 (physical component summary) (p > 0.05).

METHODS: Data is drawn from the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS Cycle 3.1, 2005) for people aged 18 or over (n = 32,598) who had a consultation with an alternative health care provider. Four groups of consultations are examined: (1) all consultations (2) massage therapy (3) acupuncture, and (4) homeopath/naturopath. Descriptive statistics, mapping and logistic regression modeling are employed to analyze the data and to compare modalities of alternative health care use. RESULTS: In 2005, more than 1.2 million adults aged 18 or over consulted an alternative health care provider, representing about 13% of the total population of Ontario. The analysis revealed a varied geographic pattern of consultations across the province. Consultations were fairly even across the urban to rural continuum and rural residents were just as likely to consult a provider as their urban counterparts. From a health perspective, people with a chronic condition, lower health status and self-perceived unmet health care needs were more likely to see an alternative health provider. Women with chronic conditions such as fibromyalgia, high blood pressure, chronic fatigue syndrome and chemical sensitivities were more likely to see an alternative provider if they felt their health care needs were not being met. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis revealed that geography is not a factor in determining alternative health care consultations in Ontario. By contrast, there is a strong association between these consultations and socio-demographic characteristics particularly age, sex, education, health and self-perceived unmet health care needs. The results underscore the importance of women's health needs as related to alternative care use. The paper concludes that there is a need for more place-specific research that explores the reasons why people use specific types of alternative health care as tied to socio-economic status, health, place of residence, and knowledge of these treatments.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No

#1779,Acupuncture for Treating Anxiety and Depression in Women: A Clinical Systematic Review,"BACKGROUND: Anxiety and depression are high in prevalence, especially in the female population, whose incidence is approximately double that of the male population. In addition, these conditions are difficult to treat and have high relapse rates and medication side-effects. There is evidence to suggest that acupuncture may be an effective treatment modality. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this review is to summarize the existing evidence on acupuncture as a therapy for anxiety and depression in women and to present a novel method for assessing acupuncture trial quality. METHODS: Published randomized controlled trials were included, whereby acupuncture was compared with any control procedure in subjects with anxiety and/or depression. Two authors extracted data independently. A novel acupuncture trial quality-assessment tool was developed to analyze the literature quality. RESULTS: Six articles used the desired inclusion and exclusion criteria. The quality of research varied heavily. Five studies were properly randomized. Three were double-blinded. Three used individualized acupuncture. Four studies were of at least reasonable quality. One was of marginal quality, and one was of poor quality. There was a significant difference between acupuncture and at least one control in all six trials. CONCLUSIONS: With respect to six reviewed studies, there is high-level evidence to support the use of acupuncture for treating major depressive disorder in pregnancy.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#1791,Revealing the Neuroimaging Mechanism of Acupuncture for Poststroke Aphasia: A Systematic Review,"BACKGROUND: Aphasia is a common symptom in stroke patients, presenting with the impairment of spontaneous speech, repetition, naming, auditory comprehension, reading, and writing function. Multiple rehabilitation methods have been suggested for the recovery of poststroke aphasia, including medication treatment, behavioral therapy, and stimulation approach. Acupuncture has been proven to have a beneficial effect on improving speech functions in repetition, oral speech, reading, comprehension, and writing ability. Neuroimaging technology provides a visualized way to explore cerebral neural activity, which helps reveal the therapeutic effect of acupuncture therapy. In this systematic review, we aim to reveal and summarize the neuroimaging mechanism of acupuncture therapy on poststroke aphasia to provide the foundation for further study. METHODS: Seven electronic databases were searched including PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, the Wanfang databases, and the Chinese Scientific Journal Database. After screening the studies according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, we summarized the neuroimaging mechanism of acupuncture on poststroke aphasia, as well as the utilization of acupuncture therapy and the methodological characteristics. RESULT: After searching, 885 articles were retrieved. After removing the literature studies, animal studies, and case reports, 16 studies were included in the final analysis. For the acupuncture type, 10 studies used manual acupuncture and 5 studies used electroacupuncture, while body acupuncture (10 studies), scalp acupuncture (7 studies), and tongue acupuncture (8 studies) were applied for poststroke aphasia patients. Based on blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) technologies, 4 neuroimaging analysis methods were used including amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF), regional homogeneity (ReHo), seed-based analysis, and independent component analysis (ICA). Two studies reported the instant acupuncture effect, and 14 studies reported the constant acupuncture's effect on poststroke aphasia patients. 5 studies analyzed the correlation between the neuroimaging outcomes and the clinical language scales. CONCLUSION: In this systematic review, we found that the mechanism of acupuncture's effect might be associated with the activation and functional connectivity of language-related brain areas, such as brain areas around Broca's area and Wernicke's area in the left inferior temporal gyrus, supramarginal gyrus, middle frontal gyrus, and inferior frontal gyrus. However, these studies were still in the preliminary stage. Multicenter randomized controlled trials (RCT) with large sample sizes were needed to verify current evidence, as well as to explore deeply the neuroimaging mechanisms of acupuncture's effects.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#1803,Acupuncture for joint symptoms related to aromatase inhibitor therapy in postmenopausal women with early-stage breast cancer: a narrative review,"BACKGROUND: Aromatase inhibitor-induced musculoskeletal syndrome (AIMSS) leads to discontinuation of aromatase inhibitor therapy in a significant proportion of patients with breast cancer. Acupuncture is popular among cancer patients and has previously been shown to improve symptoms in a range of musculoskeletal complaints. AIM: To determine the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture for the management of AIMSS in postmenopausal women with early-stage breast cancer. METHODS: A literature search was carried out for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on acupuncture for AIMSS in postmenopausal women with early-stage breast cancer. Characteristics of trials and outcomes were extracted from the retrieved articles, which were also assessed for risk of bias and quality of reporting. RESULTS: Four RCTs were retrieved of sample size 32-67 (totalling 190 participants). Compliance with treatment was high and rates of adverse events were low. Of the three two-arm RCTs, two found no difference between acupuncture and sham acupuncture and one found that acupuncture was statistically superior to sham acupuncture. The fourth RCT, which incorporated three arms, found acupuncture and sham acupuncture to be statistically superior to usual care but there was no difference between true and sham acupuncture. Three trials that used non-penetrating sham as the control found no effect of acupuncture over sham, but the one trial that used superficial needle insertion found acupuncture to be superior. CONCLUSIONS: Acupuncture is safe and results in improvement in AIMSS symptoms, but similar benefits are also elicited by non-penetrating sham acupuncture. Future research should seek to establish the durability of improvements.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#1811,Randomized trial of acupuncture to lower blood pressure,"BACKGROUND: Arterial hypertension is a prime cause of morbidity and mortality in the general population. Pharmacological treatment has limitations resulting from drug side effects, costs, and patient compliance. Thus, we investigated whether traditional Chinese medicine acupuncture is able to lower blood pressure. METHODS AND RESULTS: We randomized 160 outpatients (age, 58+/-8 years; 78 men) with uncomplicated arterial hypertension in a single-blind fashion to a 6-week course of active acupuncture or sham acupuncture (22 sessions of 30 minutes' duration). Seventy-eight percent were receiving antihypertensive medication, which remained unchanged. Primary outcome parameters were mean 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure levels after the treatment course and 3 and 6 months later. One hundred forty patients finished the treatment course (72 with active treatment, 68 with sham treatment). There was a significant (P<0.001) difference in posttreatment blood pressures adjusted for baseline values between the active and sham acupuncture groups at the end of treatment. For the primary outcome, the difference between treatment groups amounted to 6.4 mm Hg (95% CI, 3.5 to 9.2) and 3.7 mm Hg (95% CI, 1.6 to 5.8) for 24-hour systolic and diastolic blood pressures, respectively. In the active acupuncture group, mean 24-hour ambulatory systolic and diastolic blood pressures decreased significantly after treatment by 5.4 mm Hg (95% CI, 3.2 to 7.6) and 3.0 mm Hg (95% CI, 1.5 to 4.6), respectively. At 3 and 6 months, mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures returned to pretreatment levels in the active treatment group. CONCLUSIONS: Acupuncture according to traditional Chinese medicine, but not sham acupuncture, after 6 weeks of treatment significantly lowered mean 24-hour ambulatory blood pressures; the effect disappeared after cessation of acupuncture treatment.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes
#1826,Efficacy of Fu's subcutaneous needling in the treatment of neck-type cervical spondylosis: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"BACKGROUND: As a minimally invasive technique, Fu's subcutaneous needling (FSN) has been widely adopted in Chinese clinical practice for managing neck-type cervical spondylosis (CS). However, current evidence regarding its therapeutic efficacy remains inconclusive due to methodological limitations in existing studies. This systematic review and meta-analysis therefore sought to quantitatively synthesize available randomized controlled trials to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and safety of FSN for this prevalent musculoskeletal disorder. METHODS: This study protocol was prospectively registered in PROSPERO (Registration ID: CRD420251036627). The databases searched include PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Data Knowledge Service Platform (Wanfang), VIP Database (VIP), and China Biology Medicine disc (CBM). A comprehensive search was conducted across the 8 electronic databases from their inception through April 18, 2025. Eligible studies included randomized controlled trials comparing FSN with non-FSN therapies for neck-type CS. RESULTS: This study included 10 clinical studies with a total of 696 patients suffering from neck-type CS. The results of the meta - analysis revealed that the experimental group had significant advantages over the control group in terms of clinical efficacy. Specifically, for the total effective rate (odds ratio = 5.45, 95% confidence intervals [CI] = [2.75, 10.81], Z = 4.85, P  < .00001), cure rate (odds ratio = 2.25, 95% CI = [1.51, 3.34], Z = 4.01, P < .00001), visual analogue scale score (VAS, mean difference = -1.21, 95% CI = [-1.30, -1.12], Z = 25.10, P < .00001), and Neck Disability Index score (NDI, mean difference = -1.33, 95% CI = [-1.92, -0.75], Z = 4.48, P < .00001), the experimental group outperformed the control group.

#1859,Acupuncture on treating asthma: A protocol for systematic review and meta analysis,"BACKGROUND: Asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases in the world, with approximately 300 million asthma patients worldwide. The mortality rate of asthma is 1.6 to 36.7 / 100,000 people, and China has become one of the countries with the highest asthma death rate in the world. Asthma is a chronic allergic airway inflammatory disease. Patients with this disease may have symptoms such as cough, wheezing, and difficulty breathing. For many years, Western medicine has mainly used anti-inflammatory, anti-bronchial spasm, asthma, cough and oxygen to treat this disease, but the effect is not good. Clinical studies in recent years have found that the use of acupuncture in the treatment of bronchial asthma has a good clinical application prospect. This study was conducted to study the effect of using acupuncture to treat asthma. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will search for PubMed, Cochrane Library, AMED, EMbase, WorldSciNet; Nature, Science online and China Journal Full-text Database (CNKI), China Biomedical Literature CD-ROM Database (CBM), and related randomized controlled trials included in the China Resources Database. The time is limited from the construction of the library to November 2019. We will use the criteria provided by Cochrane 5.1.0 for quality assessment and risk assessment of the included studies, and use the Revman 5.3 and Stata13.0 software for meta-analysis of the effectiveness, recurrence rate, and symptom scores of asthma. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This systematic review will evaluate the efficacy and safety of acupuncture for asthma.

#1911,Acceptance of Traditional Chinese Medicine in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit: A Launching Point,"BACKGROUND: Because neonatology is a relatively new medical specialty, it is host to on-going, rapid adaptation and evolution of medical treatments and practices. This process has almost exclusively focused on Western, biomedical treatment modalities, without inclusion of potentially beneficial Traditional Chinese Medicine practices. It is unclear how receptive health-care providers in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and families of NICU patients would be to the introduction of adapted Traditional Chinese Medicine treatments into the NICU environment. OBJECTIVE: To assess the potential for engagement of patients, families, and staff in the NICU with Traditional Chinese Medicine therapies and to provide targeted education and low-risk Traditional Chinese Medicine treatments to support the health and well-being of those 3 groups. METHODS: A feasibility pilot study including weekly walk-in Traditional Chinese Medicine sessions within the NICU for parents and staff, and neonatal patient consultations, both of which included hands-on therapies and education tailored to each participant's unique needs. Pre- and postsurveys were administered over 3 phases. RESULTS: Walk-in sessions were attended by 83 adults and participants reported benefits, with no ill effects. There were 5 neonatal consultations with staff expressing an interest in more. Several obstacles to accessing Traditional Chinese Medicine modalities were identified in pre-surveys and were addressed with education and preemptive modifications to the therapies offered. CONCLUSION: Acceptance of Traditional Chinese Medicine modalities in the NICU opens the door to future studies implementing integrative health services into the NICU care model.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#1937,Birefringence of collagen fibres in rat calcaneal tendons treated with acupuncture during three phases of healing,"BACKGROUND: Birefringence is an optical anisotropy that is investigated by polarisation microscopy, and has been valuable for the study of the oriented organisation of collagen fibres in tendons. However, the application of this technology to evaluate the effect of different acupuncture points during tendon healing has not yet been described. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the concentration of non-collagenous proteins (NCP) and birefringence in rat calcaneal tendons following injury during the three different phases of healing: inflammatory (7th day), proliferative (14th day), and remodelling (21st day). METHODS: Tendons of 120 Wistar rats were tenotomised and left untreated (teno group, n=24), treated with manual acupuncture at ST36 (ST36 group, n=24), BL57 (BL57 group, n=24) or ST36+BL57 (SB group, n=24), or treated with electroacupuncture at ST36+BL57 (EA group, n=24). Tendon samples were collected at 7, 14 and 21 days after injury (n=8 per group). NCP concentrations were measured using the Bradford method (n=4 each) and birefringence was examined using polarisation microscopy and image analysis (n=4 each). Comparison was also made with healthy (non-tenotomised) tendons in a subgroup of rats (n=4 each). RESULTS: Manual acupuncture at ST36 and BL57 increased molecular organisation of collagen fibres on day 14 and 21 after injury. Isolated use of BL57 and ST36 also increased collagen fibre organisation when examined on day 14 and 21, respectively. No significant increase in NCP concentration was observed in any of the treated tenotomised groups. CONCLUSIONS: Acupuncture, through putative anti-inflammatory and mechanotransductor effects, may have a role in strengthening tendons and increasing resistance to re-rupture.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No

#1956,"Topiramate, acupuncture, and BoNT-A for chronic migraine: a network meta-analysis","BACKGROUND: Botulinum neurotoxin A (BoNT-A) was the primary choice for preventive treatment of chronic migraine. Topiramate and acupuncture showed promising effect for chronic migraine, but their effectiveness relative to BoNT-A was rarely studied. We aimed to perform a network meta-analysis to compare the effectiveness and acceptability between topiramate, acupuncture, and BoNT-A. METHODS: We searched OVID Medline, Embase, the Cochrane register of controlled trials (CENTRAL), the Chinese Clinical Trial Register, and clinicaltrials.gov for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared topiramate, acupuncture, and BoNT-A with any of them or placebo in the preventive treatment of chronic migraine. A network meta-analysis was performed by using a frequentist approach and a random-effects model. The primary outcomes were reduction in monthly headache days and monthly migraine days at week 12. Acceptability was defined as the number of dropouts owing to adverse events. RESULTS: We included 15 RCTs (n = 2545). Eleven RCTs were at low risk of bias. The network meta-analyses (n = 2061) showed that acupuncture (2061 participants; standardized mean difference [SMD] -1.61, 95% CI: -2.35 to -0.87) and topiramate (582 participants; SMD -0.4, 95% CI: -0.75 to -0.04) ranked the most effective in the reduction of monthly headache days and migraine days, respectively; but they were not significantly superior over BoNT-A. Topiramate caused the most treatment-related adverse events and the highest rate of dropouts owing to adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Topiramate and acupuncture were not superior over BoNT-A; BoNT-A was still the primary preventive treatment of chronic migraine. Large-scale RCTs with direct comparison of these three treatments are warranted to verified the findings.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#1970,Effects of Gua-Sha therapy on breast engorgement: a randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Breast engorgement is a common problem that affects the initiation and duration of breastfeeding. Limited solutions are available to relieve the discomfort associated with breast engorgement. Thus, further investigation of methods to achieve effective relief of symptoms is critical to promote breastfeeding success. PURPOSE: : The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of two breast care methods, that is, scraping (Gua-Sha) therapy (administered to the experimental group) and traditional breast care (i.e., massage and heating; administered to the control group). METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was conducted on 54 postpartum women at a Level III medical teaching hospital. Participant inclusion criteria included postpartum breastfeeding women (a) who had an uncomplicated delivery and (b) who were experiencing breast engorgement problems. The Gua-Sha protocol selected appropriate acupoint positions, which included ST16, ST18, SP17, and CV17. Each position was lightly scraped seven times in two cycles. For the control group, we used hot packs and massage for 20 min in accordance with recommendations given in an obstetrical technique textbook. RESULTS: Results showed no statistical differences between the two groups at baseline. Body temperature, breast temperature, breast engorgement, pain levels, and discomforting levels were statistically different between the two groups at 5 and 30 min after intervention (p < .001). The results of generalized estimating equation analysis indicated that, with the exception of body temperature, all variables remained more significant (p < .0001) to improving engorgement symptoms in the experimental group than those in the control group, after taking related variables into account. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Our findings provided empirical evidence supporting that Gua-Sha therapy may be used as an effective technique in the management of breast engorgement. By using Gua-Sha therapy, nurses can handle breast engorgement problems more effectively in primary care and hence help patients both physically and psychologically.",No,No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No

#1991,Research on Electroacupuncture Parameters for Cancer Pain Based on Data Mining,"BACKGROUND: Cancer pain, a common complication of this disease, has been widely treated by electroacupuncture in recent years. However, there are numerous treatment parameters that are not conducive to clinical translation applications. This study aims to summarize the stimulation parameters commonly used in electroacupuncture treating cancer pain by data mining and visualization techniques to provide a basis for the future acupuncture technology transformation and selection of optimal stimulation parameters. METHODS: Nine databases, including Pubmed, Cochrane Library, Embase, Web of Science, OVID, China National Knowledge Infrastructure Database, China Biology Medicine disk, China Science and Technology Journal Database, and Wanfang Database, were searched for clinical studies on electroacupuncture treatment cancer pain published between January 2012 and September 2022. A database was established using Microsoft Excel 2020 and analyzed with SPSS Modeler 18.1 software and SPSS statistics 26.0 software. RESULTS: Twenty-four articles were included according to the established criteria. The most used electroacupuncture stimulation parameters were a dilatational wave, the current frequency of 2/100 Hz, stimulation duration of 30 minutes per treatment, and frequency of treatment once a day. Fifty-eight acupoints were mentioned, and the total frequency of acupoints involved was 156 times. The most used ones include Zusanli (ST36), Sanyinjiao (SP06), Hegu (LI04), Neiguan (PC06), Quchi (LI11), Taichong (LR03), Ashi point, Jiaji point, and those most generally used acupoints that are closely arranged on the Stomach Channel of Foot Yangming and the Spleen Channel of Foot Taiyin. The association analysis of acupoints revealed that the most supported acupoint pair was Sanyinjiao (SP06) and Zusanli (ST36). Cluster analysis demonstrated 3 groups, 1 for obligatory acupoints, 1 for Ashi point, and the third for Jiaji point. CONCLUSIONS: A dilatational wave, the current frequency of 2/100 Hz, 30-minute stimulation, and acupoints of the Stomach Channel of Foot Yangming and the Spleen Channel of Foot Taiyin selection are frequently used in electroacupuncture for treating cancer pain.

#2004,"Acupuncture for cancer-related fatigue in lung cancer patients: a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled pilot trial","BACKGROUND: Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is a distressing symptom that is the most common unpleasant side effect experienced by lung cancer patients and is challenging for clinical care workers to manage. METHODS: We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot trial to evaluate the clinical effect of acupuncture on CRF in lung cancer patients. Twenty-eight patients presenting with CRF were randomly assigned to active acupuncture or placebo acupuncture groups to receive acupoint stimulation (LI-4, Ren-6, St-36, KI-3, and Sp-6) twice per week for 4 weeks, followed by 2 weeks of follow-up. The primary outcome was the change in intensity of CFR based on the Chinese version of the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI-C). As the secondary endpoint, the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Lung Cancer Subscale (FACT-LCS) was adopted to assess the influence of acupuncture on patients' quality of life (QOL). Adverse events and safety of treatments were monitored throughout the trial. RESULTS: Our pilot study demonstrated feasibility among patients with appropriate inclusion criteria and good compliance with acupuncture treatment. A significant reduction in the BFI-C score was observed at 2 weeks in the 14 participants who received active acupuncture compared with those receiving the placebo (P < 0.01). At week 6, symptoms further improved according to the BFI-C (P < 0.001) and the FACT-LCS (P = 0.002). There were no significant differences in the incidence of adverse events in either group (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Fatigue is a common symptom experienced by lung cancer patients.

However, there is no meta-analytic synthesis explored the efficacy of acupuncture for cancer-related insomnia among cancer patients undergoing active cancer treatments. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to explore the efficacy and safety of acupuncture for insomnia in people diagnosed with cancer. STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis of existing randomized controlled trials on acupuncture in the treatment of cancer-related insomnia. METHODS: According to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) Statement, we identified and extracted the trials through November 2021 from ten databases and two trials record platforms (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PUBMED, Web of Science, PsycINFO, Allied and Complementary Medicine, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Digital Journals, ClinicalTrials, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform). The quality of the trials was assessed using Jadad score and Risk of Bias (2.0). A meta-analysis was synthesized using the random-effects model if the included studies were in high methodological quality. RESULTS: A total of 690 studies were identified, with 22 were included in the review, and 6 of them were included in the quantitative synthesis. Studies were highly heterogeneous in terms of participant characteristics and study methodologies. Most studies recruited patients diagnosed with a specific cancer type, and breast cancer patients were the subgroup most represented. The qualitative review of available evidence suggested a beneficial efficacy of acupuncture on sleep without serious adverse events in several studies (55%). The meta-analysis revealed that acupuncture produced a significant improvement in the total Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score relative to the wait-list control among breast cancer patients undergoing active cancer treatments (MD -1.92, 95% CI -3.25 to -0.59, p = 0.005). Similar improvement of real and sham acupuncture on PSQI score change post-intervention was found (MD: -0.68, 95% CI: -2.44 to 1.07, p = 0.44). Manual acupuncture had similar effective rate as compared to estazolam immediately post-intervention (RR: 0.94, 95% CI: 0.87 to 1.01, p = 0.09), and had significantly better effective rate than estazolam at 1-week post-intervention follow-up (RR: 1.25, 95% CI: 1.10 to 1.43, p = 0.0009). All reported acupuncture related adverse events were mild or moderate in severity. CONCLUSION: Acupuncture has great potential to be used to manage cancer-related insomnia for cancer patients or survivors. More studies with rigorous designs and larger sample size are warranted to verify the efficacy and safety of acupuncture for insomnia among people diagnosed with cancer, in particular among those with clinically significant insomnia.

#2017,A Cochrane systematic review of acupuncture for cancer pain in adults,"BACKGROUND: Cancer-related pain is a significant and debilitating problem. Non-pharmacological treatments such as acupuncture may have an adjunctive role in controlling pain without the undesirable side effects of drug regimens and yet the evidence base remains limited. OBJECTIVES: The main objective of this systematic review was to evaluate the effectiveness of acupuncture in the management of cancer-related pain in adults. Subgroup analyses were planned for acupuncture dose and for the outcome of studies investigating acupuncture for cancer-induced bone pain. METHODS: Six electronic databases were searched, including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, AMED and SPORTDiscus. Studies included in the review were randomised controlled trials investigating the use of acupuncture for cancer pain using pain as a primary outcome measure. In total, 253 published references were identified but only three studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the final review. RESULTS: Of the three included studies, only one was judged to be of high methodological quality and showed auricular acupuncture to be superior to placebo acupuncture and ear seeds at placebo points. However, the study was relatively small and blinding was compromised. The two low-quality studies gave positive results in favour of acupuncture for cancer pain, but these results should be viewed with caution due to methodological limitations, small sample sizes, poor reporting and inadequate analysis. CONCLUSION: There is insufficient evidence to judge whether acupuncture is effective in treating cancer pain in adults.",No,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#2030,The treatment effect of intramuscular stimulation on carpal tunnel syndrome: A blinded randomized trial on 75 patients,"BACKGROUND: Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a disorder with a prevalence of about 5.8% for females and 0.6% for males. This study aims to determine whether intramuscular stimulation (IMS) to the pronator teres muscle subsequently reduces the severity of clinical parameters and the diameter of the median nerve. METHODS: Seventy-five individuals with a cross-sectional diameter of the median nerve of more than 2 mm were included in this randomized clinical trial. Thirty-seven individuals received IMS to the pronator teres muscle with a depth of up to 45-50 mm. The 38 individuals in the control group received an acupuncture needle at Li11 with a depth of 4-5 mm. Both groups had 7 treatments within 7 weeks. The primary outcome was the cross-section of the median nerve in the carpal tunnel. Additionally, Phalen's test, Tinel's sign, VAS for pain intensity, and pincer grip strength were measured. RESULTS: Both IMS subjects and controls showed significant reductions in the cross-section of the median nerve from baseline to follow-up (p < 0.001 and p = 0.002 respectively). The IMS group had the largest change, but the difference in change between the groups was not significant (p = 0.39). On all clinical tests, IMS subjects showed significant improvement from baseline compared with the control group (largest p = 0.002). CONCLUSION: In this study we found that IMS to the pronator teres muscle significantly improved all clinical variables measured, compared with the group receiving acupuncture. Furthermore, the cross-section of the median nerve reduced over time for both groups. IMS may be a low-risk alternative while patients are waiting for surgery.

#2067,"Efficacy of acupuncture in the prevention and treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in patients with advanced cancer: a multi-center, single-blind, randomized, sham-controlled clinical research","BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) is a common and distressing side effect. We conducted this clinical trial to compare the effectiveness of true acupuncture vs. sham acupuncture in controlling chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) among patients with advanced cancer. METHODS: A total of 134 participants were randomly allocated into true acupuncture (TA) (n = 68) and sham acupuncture (SA) (n = 66) groups. Participants in both groups received acupuncture session twice on the first day of chemotherapy, and once consecutively on the following 4 days. The primary outcome was using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) to assess CINV. The secondary outcome measures were the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score (ECOG), Simplified Nutritional Appetite Questionnaire (SNAQ), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HADS). RESULTS: Compared to the SA group, the TA group didn't show significant improvement in complete response rates of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (all P > 0.05). However, the TA group could modestly reduce the severity of nausea (from day-3 to day-21, P < 0.05) or vomiting (from day-4 to day-21, P < 0.05), which is notably superior to the control group. Besides, TA promoted the nutritional status of patients with a significantly higher score comparing to the SA group on day 14 (21.82 vs.20.12, P = 0.003) and day 21 (22.39 vs. 20.43, P = 0.001). No apparent differences were found in anxiety and depression assessment between these groups. Participants in both groups were well tolerant of acupuncture therapy. There was no adverse event occurs in our study. CONCLUSION: Acupuncture as an adjunctive approach could alleviate the severity of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting compared to the sham control, even though the effect of acupuncture in preventing CINV occurring is relatively modest.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes
#2091,Non-pharmacological therapy for chemotherapy-induced peripheral neurotoxicity: a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials,"BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neurotoxicity (CIPN) is the most common adverse effect in patients undergoing chemotherapy, and no effective interventions are currently available for its prevention and treatment. Non-pharmacological therapies appear to be beneficial for the prevention and treatment of CIPN, but it remains unclear which therapy is most effective. The aim of this study was to identify the most effective non-pharmacological therapy for CIPN patients. METHODS: PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane Library were searched for randomized controlled trials on non-pharmacological therapies for CIPN. The primary outcomes included pain and peripheral neuropathological symptoms, and the secondary outcomes included quality of life, sensory and motor symptoms. The pairwise analysis and a network meta-analysis were performed using a random effects model. RESULTS: A total of 46 articles were included in this study, involving 2,878 participants. Our study showed that massage was more effective in pain-alleviating compared with acupuncture [SMD = 0.81, 95%CI (0.04, 1.57)], vitamin and gabapentin [SMD = 2.56, 95%CI (1.39, 3.74)], and usual care and placebo [SMD = 0.9, 95%CI (0.31, 1.49)]. As for attenuating peripheral neuropathological symptoms, massage was more effective than usual care and placebo [SMD = 0.75, 95%CI (0.33, 1.17)], sensorimotor training [SMD = 1.17, 95%CI (0.24, 2.10)], electrostimulation [SMD=-1.18, 95%CI (-2.14, -0.21)], multimodal exercise [SMD=-0.82, 95%CI (-1.57, -0.08)], and resistance training [SMD = 1.03, 95%CI (0.11, 1.95)]. Massage was also more effective than other non-pharmacological therapies in improving quality of life, sensory and motor symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: According to our study, massage has advantages in alleviating pain, improving quality of life, and improving peripheral neuropathological symptoms and has better effect than other non-pharmacological interventions, representing certain clinical significance.

#2130,[Effects of summer acupoint application therapy in reducing exacerbation frequency of chronic lung diseases: protocol of a retrospective and prospective study],"BACKGROUND: Chronic lung diseases, including bronchial asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic bronchitis, allergic rhinitis and repeated respiratory tract infection (RRTL) in infants, exacerbate frequently in winter because of respiratory viral infections and low temperature. Summer acupoint application therapy (SAAT) is thought to be effective in reducing exacerbation frequency of chronic lung diseases in winter. It is a kind of therapy using a herbal mixture for external application on special acupoints during summer. The herbal mixture basically contains Semen Sinapis Albae, Herba Asari, Radix Euphorbiae Kansui and Rhizoma Corydalis. The acupoints include Feishu (BL13), Dazhui (GV14) and Danzhong (CV17). Through a large-scale multicenter trial based on three years of clinical observation, and retrospective and prospective analyses, this study aims to explore the efficacy of SAAT. METHODS AND DESIGN: In this clinical observation trial, patients who have been diagnosed with bronchial asthma, COPD, chronic bronchitis, allergic rhinitis or RRTL will be enrolled from 13 centers. All patients enrolled will be treated with SAAT over a two-year period by medical practitioners. After this, an initial case report form (CRF) will be completed and forwarded to the central study site (China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing, China). The CRF is designed to investigate patients' history of medical treatment (including SAAT) and chronic lung disease exacerbation, also self-reported health condition. For retrospective analyses, the authors will focus on those who have accepted SAAT before enrollment and will collect their SAAT history and chronic lung disease exacerbation history, to evaluate the effects of SAAT. For prospective analyses, medical students will follow up with patients by phone interviews in winter once a year. The primary outcome is frequency of chronic lung disease exacerbation in winter. The secondary outcomes include conditions of lung disease recovery, non-SAAT therapy, and a self health report. DISCUSSION: The authors aim to collect 7 400 patients from July 2008 to August 2009. The final follow-up has been completed in December 2010. To reduce the selection bias, a total of 13 clinical centers from different areas of China have participated in this study.

#2180,A systematic review and meta-analysis of moxibustion for chronic prostatitis,"BACKGROUND: Chronic prostatitis (CP) is a common condition that affects many individuals. Previous clinical trials have explored the use of moxibustion as a potential treatment for CP. However, the evidence on the effectiveness of moxibustion for CP remains limited. Therefore, this study aimed to comprehensively assess the effects of moxibustion for CP. METHODS: In order to gather relevant and up-to-date information, we conducted a systematic literature search of databases including Cochrane Library, PUBMED, EMBASE, CNKI, and Wangfang from inception until June 30, 2023. Only randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that investigated the use of moxibustion for CP were included in this study. The primary outcomes of interest were the National Institutes of Health-Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (NIH-CPSI) scores and the overall response rate. To evaluate the quality of the included studies, we used the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. RESULTS: After analyzing the data from 8 RCTs involving a total of 664 patients, we found significant differences in NIH-CPSI scores between moxibustion and other treatment modalities. Specifically, when compared with herbal medicine, moxibustion was associated with a mean difference (MD) of -1.78 in NIH-CPSI scores (95% confidence interval [CI] [-2.78, -0.78], P < .001), and when compared with western medicine, moxibustion was associated with a MD of -5.24 in NIH-CPSI scores (95% CI [-7.80, -2.67], P < .08). In terms of the overall response rate, moxibustion was found to be superior to herbal medicine, with a MD of 2.36 (95% [19, 4.67], P = .01). Additionally, when moxibustion was combined with herbal medicine, it yielded a higher overall response rate with a MD of 4.07 (95% CI [1.54, 10.74], P = .005) compared to herbal medicine alone. Moxibustion also outperformed western medicine in terms of the overall response rate, with a MD of 4.56 (95% CI [2.24, 9.26], P < .001). CONCLUSION: Based on the findings of this study, moxibustion appears to be a potentially efficacious treatment for CP. The results suggest that moxibustion can improve NIH-CPSI scores and overall response rate in patients with CP. However, further high-quality studies are needed to validate these results and establish the long-term effects of moxibustion as a treatment for CP.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No

#2214,The impact of STRICTA and CONSORT on reporting of randomised control trials of acupuncture: a systematic methodological evaluation,"BACKGROUND: Clear and unambiguous reporting is essential for researchers and clinicians to be able to assess the quality of research. To enhance the quality of reporting, consensus-based reporting guidelines are commonly used. OBJECTIVES: To update and extend previous research by evaluating the more recent impact of STRICTA (STandards for Reporting Interventions in Controlled Trials of Acupuncture) and CONSORT (CONsolidated Standards Of Reporting Trials) guidelines on the quality of reporting of acupuncture trials. METHODS: By random sampling, approximately 45 trials from each of five 2-year time periods between 1994 and 2015 were included in the study. Using scoring sheets based on the STRICTA and CONSORT checklist items (range 0 to 7 and 0 to 5, respectively), the distribution of items reported over time was investigated, with changes shown using scatterplots. The primary analysis used a before-and-after t-test to compare time periods. A meta-analysis investigated whether or not trials published in journals that endorsed STRICTA were associated with better reporting. RESULTS: The study included 207 trials. Improved reporting of items over time was observed, as represented by changes in the scatterplot slope and intercept. The mean STRICTA score increased from 4.27 in the 1994-1995 period to 5.53 in 2014-2015, an 18% improvement. The mean CONSORT score rose from 1.01 in the 1994-1995 period to 3.32 in 2014-2015, an increment of 46%. There was proportionately lower reporting for items related to practitioner background (STRICTA) and for randomisation implementation and allocation concealment (CONSORT). Trials published in journals that endorsed STRICTA had statistically significantly superior reporting of both STRICTA and CONSORT items overall. CONCLUSION: This study has provided evidence of an improvement in reporting of STRICTA and CONSORT items over the time period from 1994 to 2015. Journals that endorse STRICTA have a better record in terms of reporting quality. Some evidence suggests that the publication of STRICTA has had a positive impact on reporting quality.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No

However, the intrinsic neuroimaging mechanisms underlying the antidepressant effects of these nPHTs are not yet fully understood. METHODS: We analyzed longitudinal resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data from a randomized, single-blind clinical trial involving 96 first-episode, drug-naïve college students with subclinical depression and sleep disorders (sDSD; mean age 20.43 ± 2.72 years; 66.7% female) and 90 healthy controls (HCs; mean age 21.02 ± 2.68 years; 61.1% female). Participants with sDSD were randomly assigned to receive either scalp EA (n = 47) or CS (n = 49) for six weeks. The regional homogeneity (ReHo) and amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) before and after nPHT were calculated. Correlation and mediation analyses were performed to investigate the complex relationships between fMRI indicators and clinical symptoms. RESULTS: The ALFF in the left paracentral lobule in sDSD patients presented an interaction effect between group and time following six weeks of nPHT. In the CS group, the ALFF in the left paracentral lobule decreased (p < 0.001), and in the EA group, it increased (p < 0.05). Compared with HCs, the baseline sDSD has many abnormal brain regions in terms of ALFF and ReHo. The whole-brain average ReHo was negatively correlated with depression scores (r = -0.26, p < 0.001) and sleep quality scores (r = -0.25, p < 0.001) and mediated the association between depression and sleep disorders [β = 0.2857, p < 0.001, 95% CI (0.23, 0.35)]. CONCLUSIONS: Nonpharmacological therapies provide different therapeutic outcomes in terms of the same rs-fMRI indicator. ALFF in the left paracentral lobule could be used as an imaging biomarker in nPHT selection. Rs-fMRI indicators are promising for understanding the neural basis of the complex relationship between subclinical depression and insomnia comorbidities in young adults.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes
#2222,Combination Electroacupuncture and Guidelines Directed Medical Therapy Maintained Stability of Heart Rate and Mean Arterial Pressure in Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction,"BACKGROUND: Clinical studies have shown that electroacupuncture (EA) has therapeutic and modulatory effects on managing heart failure (HF) risk factors. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the impact of combination drugs and EA on chronic HF patients with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) to maintain a stable heart rate (HR) and mean arterial pressure (MAP). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This single-blind clinical randomized controlled trial included 42 patients with chronic HFrEF. The patients were divided into 3 groups: patients taking drugs and EA, patients taking drugs and sham EA (sham acupuncture [SA]), and patients taking drugs without EA. All patients underwent 16 sessions of therapy for 8 weeks. RESULTS: There was a significant difference in the average MAP based on therapy duration in the drugs + EA group, whereas there was no significant difference between drugs + SA and drugs without EA groups. There was a substantial difference between the average MAP in the drugs + EA group at the beginning of therapy compared with that at midtherapy (P < 0.05) and at the beginning of treatment and at the end of therapy (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in the mean HR between the groups. Clinically, after 16 treatment sessions, patients receiving combined drugs and EA treatment presented with stable MAP and HR. CONCLUSIONS: Drugs combined with EA maintained the stability of MAP and HR in patients with chronic HFrEF.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes
#2242,Comparative analysis of efficacy of different combination therapies of α-receptor blockers and traditional Chinese medicine external therapy in the treatment of chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome: Bayesian network meta-analysis,"BACKGROUND: Combination therapy of α-receptor blockers (α-RBs) and traditional Chinese medicine external therapy can serve as a treatment of chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS). α-RBs includes tamsulosin, terazosin and so on and the traditional Chinese medicine external therapy includes needling, moxibustion, acupoint catgut embedding, acupoint application, auricular point sticking and hot medicated compress and so forth. Currently, there is no study in which Bayesian network meta-analysis is applied to making a comparative analysis of efficacy of different combination therapies of α-RBs and traditional Chinese medicine external therapy in the treatment of CP/CPPS. Therefore, based on Bayesian algorithm, a network meta-analysis was conducted by us to make a comparison between different combination therapies of α-RBs and traditional Chinese medicine external therapy. METHODS: A document retrieval was conducted in the databases PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, Web of science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, WanFang Data Dissertations of China database, VIP China Science and Technology Journal Database, SinoMed. Literatures were searched for published in biomedical journals concerning clinical study on α-RBs combined with various traditional Chinese medicine external therapies in the treatment of CP/CPPS from inception of database to July 2022. Newest version risks of bias assessment tool (RoB2) was used to assess the risks of bias of studies included in this analysis. Stata 16.0 software and R4.1.3 software were used to make a Bayesian network meta-analysis and charts. RESULTS: 19 literatures were included involving 1739 patients concerning 12 interventions which were used in the treatment of CP/CPPS. With respect to the total effective rate, α-RBs+ needling was most likely to be the optimal treatment. Concerning National Institutes of Health Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (NIH-CPSI) total score, α-RBs+ moxibustion+ auricular point sticking was most likely to be optimal treatment, the therapy ranking second was α-RBs+ needling, and the therapy ranking third was α-RBs+ moxibustion. Pain score, voiding score and quality-of-life score are subdomains of the NIH-CPSI total score. With regard to pain score, α-RBs+ moxibustion was most likely to be optimal treatment. In reference to voiding and quality-of-life score, there was no statistically significant difference between the efficacy of various interventions. CONCLUSIONS: α-RBs+ needling, α-RBs+ moxibustion and α-RBs+ moxibustion+ auricular point sticking provided relatively good efficacy in the treatment of CP/CPPS. In these treatments, attention should be paid on α-RBs+ needling and α-RBs+ moxibustion which ranked higher many times in the evaluation of various outcome indicators. However, there still were certain limitations in this study, so large-sample clinical randomized control trials with a rigor design following the evidence-based medicine standards need to be conducted to justify the results of this study.

#2251,Systematic review: Complementary and alternative medicine in the irritable bowel syndrome,"BACKGROUND: Complementary and alternative medical therapies and practices are widely employed in the treatment of the irritable bowel syndrome. AIM: To review the usage of complementary and alternative medicine in the irritable bowel syndrome, and to assess critically the basis and evidence for its use. METHODS: A systematic review of complementary and alternative medical therapies and practices in the irritable bowel syndrome was performed based on literature obtained through a Medline search. RESULTS: A wide variety of complementary and alternative medical practices and therapies are commonly employed by irritable bowel syndrome patients both in conjunction with and in lieu of conventional therapies. As many of these therapies have not been subjected to controlled clinical trials, some, at least, of their efficacy may reflect the high-placebo response rate that is characteristic of irritable bowel syndrome. Of those that have been subjected to clinical trials most have involved small poor quality studies. There is, however, evidence to support efficacy for hypnotherapy, some forms of herbal therapy and certain probiotics in irritable bowel syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Doctors caring for irritable bowel syndrome patients need to recognize the near ubiquity of complementary and alternative medical use among this population and the basis for its use. All complementary and alternative medicine is not the same and some, such as hypnotherapy, forms of herbal therapy, specific diets and probiotics, may well have efficacy in irritable bowel syndrome. Above all, we need more science and more controlled studies; the absence of truly randomized placebo-controlled trials for many of these therapies has limited meaningful progress in this area.",No,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#2272,Use of non-assigned smoking cessation programs among participants of a Web-based randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Concurrent with their enrollment in Web-based Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs), participants can easily choose to use treatment programs that are not assigned in the study. The prevalence of using non-assigned treatments is largely unknown although it is likely to be related to the extent to which non-assigned treatments are: (a) easy to find and use, (b) low in cost, (c) well publicized, and (d) available from trusted sources. The impact of using other programs--both beneficial and detrimental--warrants additional research investigation. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this report is to explore the extent to which participants enrolled in a Web-based intervention for smoking cessation used treatment methods that were not explicitly assigned (""non-assigned treatment""). In addition to describing the relation between using non-assigned treatments and smoking cessation outcomes, we also explore the broader issue of non-assigned program use by RCT participants in Web-based behavioral interventions, generally. METHODS: We describe the use of other programs (as measured by self-report at the 3-month follow-up assessment) by 1028 participants who were randomized to the Web-based SHIP (Smokers' Health Improvement Program) RCT which compared the Quit Smoking Network (QSN) treatment program and the Active Lives control condition. We examine the extent to which pharmacotherapy products were used by participants in the QSN condition (which explicitly recommended their use) and the Active Lives condition (which purposefully omitted mention of the use of pharmacotherapy). We also test for any between-condition impact of using non-assigned treatments and pharmacotherapy products on smoking cessation outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 24.1% (248/1028) participants reported using one or more smoking cessation treatment programs that were not explicitly recommended or assigned in their treatment protocol. Types of non-assigned treatments used in this manner included individual counseling (1.7%), group counseling (2.3%), hypnotherapy/acupuncture (4.5%), pamphlets/books (12.6%), and other Web-based smoking cessation programs (9.0%). Participants who used non-assigned treatments were more likely to be female and have at least a high school education. Use of non-assigned Web programs was related to greater levels of self-reported smoking cessation measured at the 3-month assessment (OR = 2.63, CI = 1.67 - 4.14, P < .001) as well as the combined 3- and 6-month assessments (OR = 2.09, CI = 1.11 - 3.91, P = .022). In terms of reported medication use, there were no differences between conditions in the number of pharmacotherapy products used. However, more participants in the QSN condition used at least one pharmacotherapy product: 50.0% (262/524) vs 43.8% (221/504); chi(2)(1, N = 1028) = 3.90, P = .048. The use of pharmacotherapy and non-assigned treatment types showed a small but marginally significant correlation: r(1028) = .061, P = .05. CONCLUSIONS: A noteworthy proportion of individuals recruited via the Internet to participate in a Web-based intervention used treatment programs and tools not formally assigned as a part of their research protocol. We consider factors likely to influence using non-assigned treatments and suggest ways that future research can begin to study more fully this important phenomenon which is likely to be found in any type of research, but may be particularly pronounced in minimal contact, Web-based intervention trials.",No,No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No
#2298,Acupuncture as an alternative or in addition to conventional treatment for chronic non-specific low back pain: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"BACKGROUND: Conventional therapies (CTs), pharmacological (PH) and non-pharmacological (NPH), do not always achieve benefits in the treatment of chronic low back pain (CLBP). We assessed efficacy and safety of acupuncture for CLBP as alternative or addition to CT. METHODS: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing acupuncture alone or in combination with CT to CT. We searched Medline, Cochrane Library, Embase up to May 2022. We assessed risk of bias with the original Cochrane tool and GRADE certainty of evidence. Results were pooled through meta-analysis. RESULTS: Ten RCTs (2122 participants) were included comparing acupuncture versus CT and 4 RCTs (374 participants) were comparing acupuncture plus CT to CT alone. In terms of comparing acupuncture with NPH or PH, no differences were found for pain and disability. Comparing acupuncture with PH and NPH combined, pain and disability were reduced (SMD=-0.50, 95% CI -0.62 to -0.37; SMD=-0.71, 95% CI -1.17 to -0.24). Comparing acupuncture plus NPH with NPH alone, pain and disability were reduced (SMD=-0.70, 95% CI -0.94 to -0.46; SMD=-0.95, 95% CI -1.36 to -0.54). Comparing acupuncture plus PH with PH alone, pain and disability were reduced (MD=-0.21, 95% CI -433.28 to -10.42; MD=-3.1, 95% CI -4.87 to -1.83). Comparing acupuncture plus combined treatment versus combined treatment alone, no differences were found in pain, while disability was reduced (MD=-3.40 95% CI -5.17 to -1.63). No studies assessed adverse event. Certainty of evidence ranged from moderate to very low. CONCLUSIONS: We are uncertain whether acupuncture is more effective and safer than CT. In the comparisons without estimates' imprecision, acupuncture showed promising results. Acupuncture could be an option based on patients' preferences.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#2302,Efficacy of acupuncture in prevention of postoperative nausea in cardiac surgery patients,"BACKGROUND: Coronary artery bypass graft and cardiac valve surgeries are frequently performed in medical facilities in the United States, and postoperative nausea (PON) is a prevalent problem in this patient population. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a single preoperative acupuncture treatment in the prevention of PON in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft or cardiac valve surgery, or both. METHODS: Ninety participants presenting for coronary artery bypass graft or cardiac valve surgery, or both, were recruited for this study. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either one preoperative acupuncture and standard postoperative care (acupuncture group) or solely standard postoperative care (control group). Acupuncture was performed 0.5 to 3 hours before surgery. The PON incidence and severity on postoperative day (POD) 2 and POD 3 were measured with validated nausea tools. RESULTS: The acupuncture group had a significantly lower incidence of nausea compared with the control group (POD 2, odds ratio [OR], 0.38; p = 0.05; and POD 3, OR, 0.26; p = 0.01). The acupuncture group also had a significantly lower score of nausea severity than the control group (POD 2, OR, 0.29; p = 0.01; and POD 3, OR, 0.25; p = 0.01). No adverse effects due to acupuncture treatment were reported. Antiemetics, pain medications, and anesthetics administered intraoperatively did not differ between the two groups and did not influence study results. CONCLUSIONS: A single preoperative acupuncture treatment decreased incidence and severity of PON in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft or cardiac valve surgery, or both, and caused no adverse effects.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes
#2324,NK cells mediate the cumulative analgesic effect of electroacupuncture in a rat model of neuropathic pain,"BACKGROUND: Cumulating evidence has revealed the effectiveness of acupuncture therapy in relieving pain via immunoregulation. However, its underlying mechanism remains unknown. The present study was designed to determine the changes of immunogenic responses at different time-points of electroacupuncture (EA) interventions in neuropathic pain rats. METHODS: The neuropathic pain model was established by ligature of the left sciatic nerve to induce chronic constriction injury (CCI). EA was applied at Zusanli (ST36) and Yanglingquan (GB34) for the EA groups. The thermal pain threshold was detected with an algesia-detector. The subgroups of plasma and splenic lymphocytes were determined via fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Specific inflammatory cytokines were assayed using an ELISA-based bead multiplex assay. The activities of splenic natural killer (NK) cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes were detected by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium colorimetric method. For confirming the involvement of NK cell in EA-analgesia, anti-asialo-ganglio-N-tetraosylceramide (anti-asialo-GM1) antibody was given to CCI rats before EA. RESULTS: Following CCI, the thermal pain threshold of the affected hind footpad was significantly decreased, and increased from the 3rd day to the 12th day after EA interventions, presenting a time-dependent tendency from the 5th day on. From day 3 to 5 of EA interventions, the percentages and activity of splenic NK cells, concentrations of splenic interleukin-2 (IL-2) and beta-endorphin (β-EP) were significantly increased. Meanwhile, the concentrations of plasma IL-2, IL-1β and gamma-interferon (IFN-γ) were significantly decreased and returned to the normal level on day 12 following EA. Plasma transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) levels were considerably upregulated on day 5 and 12 following EA. The CD4+/CD8+ T cell ratio was markedly downregulated compared with the control and CCI groups on day 5 and returned to the normal level on day 12 following EA. After depleting NK cells by anti-asialo-GM1 antibody, the increased thermal pain threshold following EA intervention was obviously reduced. CONCLUSIONS: Repeated EA interventions have a time-dependent cumulative analgesic effect in neuropathic pain rats, which is closely associated with its regulatory effects on NK cells, splenic IL-2, β-EP, and plasma IL-2, IL-1β, IFN-γ and TGF-β levels.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#2326,The Effectiveness and Safety of Cupping Therapy on CV8 Shenque for Urticaria: A Systematic Review and Meta‑Analysis,"BACKGROUND: Cupping therapy (CT) on acupoint CV8 Shenque is a potential treatment of urticaria. This review will analyze the efficacy and safety of CT on CV8 Shenque. METHODS: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing CT on CV8 Shenque with other treatments were retrieved from 14 worldwide databases from their inception to June 2024. Primary outcomes were symptom scores (SS), quality of life (QoL), and effective rate (ER). Using Review Manager, results were presented as risk ratio (RR) or mean difference (MD), with a 95% confidence interval (CI). The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane ""risk of bias"" tool, and the quality of evidence was evaluated with the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE). RESULTS: A total of six RCTs with 409 patients were included. Compared with other treatments, CT on CV8 Shenque significantly improved ER (RR = 1.20, 95% CI [1.07, 1.35], P = .002, 6 RCTs, n = 409), SS (including wheal scores (MD = -0.64, 95% CI [-0.91, -0.37], 2 RCTs, n = 123), symptom duration scores (MD = -0.37, 95% CI [-0.62, -0.12], 2 RCTs, n = 123), and QoL (MD = -2.08, 95% CI [-3.28, -0.88], 1 RCT, n = 66). CONCLUSION: CT on CV8 Shenque can be a potential therapy for urticaria. Since the overall quality and quantity of the included RCTs were not satisfactory, high-quality research is necessary to further verify the results in the future.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#2340,Commonalities in the central nervous system's involvement with complementary medical therapies: limbic morphinergic processes,"BACKGROUND: Currently, complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) are experiencing growing popularity, especially in former industrialized countries. However, most of the underlying physiological and molecular mechanisms as well as participating biological structures are still speculative. Specific and non-specific effects may play a role in CAM. Moreover, trust, belief, and expectation may be of importance, pointing towards common central nervous system (CNS) pathways involved in CAM. MATERIAL/METHODS: Four CAM approaches (acupuncture, meditation, music therapy, and massage therapy) were examined with regard to the CNS activity pattern involved. CNS commonalities between different approaches were investigated. RESULTS: Frontal/prefrontal and limbic brain structures play a role in CAM. Particularly, left-anterior regions of the brain and reward or motivation circuitry constituents are involved, indicating positive affect and emotion-related memory processing--accompanied by endocrinologic and autonomic functions--as crucial components of CAM effects. Thus, trust and belief in a therapist or positive therapy expectations seem to be important. However, besides common non-specific or subjective effects, specific (objective) physiological components also exist. CONCLUSIONS: Non-specific CNS commonalities are involved in various CAM therapies. Different therapeutic approaches physiologically overlap in the brain. However, molecular correspondents of the detected CNS analogies still have to be specified. In particular, fast acting autoregulatory signaling molecules presumably play a role. These may also be involved in the placebo response.",No,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#2374,The Effect of Acupressure at GB-21 and SP-6 Acupoints on Anxiety Level and Maternal-Fetal Attachment in Primiparous Women: a Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial,"BACKGROUND: Delivery is one of the most stressful events in women's life. Excessive anxiety, in turn, increases delivery and pregnancy complications. Mother's positive experience of delivery leads to more effective maternal-fetal attachment in the first few hours of birth. OBJECTIVES: The present study aimed to compare the effects of acupressure at two different acupoints on anxiety level and maternal-fetal attachment in primiparous women. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, 150 primiparous women were allocated to acupressure at GB-21 acupoint, acupressure at SP-6 acupoint, and control group. The women in their active phase of delivery were enrolled in the study and pressure was applied to the acupoints for 20 minutes. Mother's anxiety level was assessed using Spielberger's questionnaire before and one hour after the intervention. In addition, maternal-fetal attachment behaviors were evaluated using Avant's questionnaire during the first breastfeeding. Then the data were introduced to the SPSS (v. 13) and were analyzed using t test and one way ANOVA. RESULTS: The results revealed no significant difference among the three groups regarding the anxiety level before the intervention (P > 0.05). One hour after the intervention, this measure was significantly lower in the intervention groups in comparison to the control group (P < 0.001). However, no significant difference was found between the two intervention groups in this regard (P > 0.05). Moreover, maternal-fetal attachment was higher in the intervention groups in comparison with the control group (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Acupressure at both acupoints reduced anxiety level and increased maternal-fetal attachment. This method can be easily used in the delivery room.",No,No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No
#2392,Acupuncture in treating cardiovascular disease complicated with depression: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"BACKGROUND: Depression is a serious risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Improving depression can alleviate cardiac symptoms and improve quality of life. Studies have shown that acupuncture has a positive effect on depression and CVD. This systematic review and meta-analysis will evaluate the efficacy and safety of acupuncture in the treatment of depression complicated with CVD. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, CNKI, Wanfang, VIP, and China Biomedical Literature databases. Randomized controlled trials of acupuncture vs. standard care or sham acupuncture or antidepressants were included. The retrieval time is from database construction to 07 April 2022. We used the ""risk of bias"" tool of Cochrane Collaboration, and the Review Manager (RevMan.) Version 5.4.1 for statistics analysis. Primary outcomes included Hamilton scale for depression (HAMD), self-rating depression scale (SDS), and the effective rate of depression. Secondary outcomes included frequency of angina pectoris and visual analogue scale (VAS) scores for angina pain. RESULTS: A total of 2,366 studies were screened based on the search strategy. Twelve eligible studies with a total of 1,203 participants have been identified. The result showed that acupuncture reduced the HAMD score [weighted mean difference (WMD): -3.23; 95% confidence interval (CI): -5.38 to -1.09; P = 0.003] and the SDS score (WMD: -1.85; 95% CI: -2.14 to -1.56; P < 0.00001) in patients with depression complicated with CVD. Acupuncture also improved the effective rate of depression (risk ratio: 1.15; 95% CI: 1.03 to 1.29; P = 0.01). The result also showed that acupuncture reduced the attack frequency of angina pectoris (WMD: -4.54; 95% CI: -5.96 to -3.11; P < 0.00001) and the VAS score for angina pain (WMD: -0.72; 95% CI: -1.06 to -0.38; P < 0.0001). This article reviewed the significant advantages of acupuncture for depression and the superiority of acupuncture over no-intervention therapy, antidepressant therapy, and psychotherapy in reducing angina frequency and pain intensity in patients with CVD. CONCLUSION: This systematic review suggested that acupuncture was a good complementary and alternative therapy for CVD complicated with depression. Considering the limitations of the included research literature, it is still necessary to perform multi-center, large-sample, and double-blind high-quality studies to provide higher-level evidence in the later stage.

#2438,Effects of electroacupuncture stimulation at different spinal segmental levels in a rat model of diabetes mellitus,"BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is associated with high morbidity, mortality and economic cost. Studies have shown that acupuncture can improve many symptoms of DM. OBJECTIVES: To examine for differences in effects of electroacupuncture (EA) stimulation at Weiwanxiashu, BL15 and BL23 in the streptozotocin (STZ)-induced DM rat model, to help guide clinical selection of acupuncture points. METHODS: 90 male rats weighing 160Â±5 g were used. 12 rats were control fed (Normal group) and 78 were fed a high-fat high-sugar diet for 8 weeks and underwent intraperitoneal STZ injection to model DM. 60 animals that met modelling criteria were randomly divided into an untreated DM group and four groups receiving EA at Weiwanxiashu (DM+WWX group), BL15 (DM+BL15 group), BL23 (DM+BL23 group) or a non-traditional acupuncture point on the tail (DM+Tail group). Fasting blood glucose, total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and insulin levels were determined and an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) performed. RESULTS: EA at Weiwanxiashu had a glucose-lowering effect on the 21st and 28th days, decreased TC, TG and LDL-C levels, increase insulin levels and improved glucose tolerance. EA at BL15 had a glucose-lowering effect on the7th, 14th and 21st days of intervention but did not impact lipids, insulin or OGTT parameters. EA at BL23 or on the tail had no significant effects. CONCLUSION: EA at Weiwanxiashu and BL15 had differential effects on metabolic markers in the STZ-induced rat model of DM. These effects may be explained neuroanatomically by variations in the segmental innervation of the tissues at these locations.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#2461,Traditional medicine treatment for thoracic outlet syndrome: A protocol for systematic review of randomized controlled trials,"BACKGROUND: Diagnosis of thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) is challenging; however, proper evaluation and treatment ensure relief from symptoms in most patients. A comprehensive approach to treatment is important, considering the multifactorial etiology of TOS. The objective of this systematic review is to describe the methods for evaluating the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture-based traditional medicine treatments for TOS.

ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The results of this systematic review will be published in a peer-reviewed journal and disseminated both electronically and in print. The review will be updated to inform and guide health care practices. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: PROSPERO 2020 CRD42020164869.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#2504,Electroacupuncture Enhances Gastric Accommodation via the Autonomic and Cytokine Mechanisms in Functional Dyspepsia,"BACKGROUND: Due to complex pathophysiology of functional dyspepsia, medications to treat functional dyspepsia are not effective for all patients. Transcutaneous electrical acustimulation (TEA) is an potentially effective therapy for functional dyspepsia without proofs of definite mechanisms. AIMS: We aimed to investigate the therapeutic impacts of TEA on postprandial distress syndrome (PDS) and explore potential neuroimmune mechanisms. METHODS: We conducted a double-blinded, randomized, controlled trial in 30 PDS patients randomized for 4-week TEA or sham-TEA. Dyspeptic symptoms, gastric accommodation, gastric emptying and heart rate variability (HRV) were assessed. Duodenal mucosal inflammation was also evaluated. RESULTS: The dyspeptic symptoms were improved with TEA compared with sham-TEA (P = 0.03). The initial satiety volume and the maximum tolerable volume (MTV) were both improved after the TEA treatment, compared with the sham-TEA group (P all < 0.05). The gastric emptying time (T1/2) was not altered with TEA or sham-TEA. The TEA treatment increased vagal activity and decreased sympathovagal ratio assessed by HRV (P all < 0.01). The IL-6 expression in bulb mucosa was downregulated by the TEA treatment compared to the baseline (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Noninvasive TEA improves gastric accommodation and dyspeptic symptoms, possibly by downregulating the IL-6 expression in duodenal bulb mucosa via the vagal efferent pathway.",No,No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No
#2507,Auriculotherapy to control chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in patients with cancer: protocol of a systematic review,"BACKGROUND: Due to the worldwide rise in cancer incidence, and therefore the rise in the need for antineoplastic chemotherapy, it is important for both healthcare professionals and patients alike that the side effects of chemotherapy, such as chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), are treated and prevented. Auriculotherapy is a type of acupuncture and may be a low-cost and safe antiemetic measure to control the side effects of chemotherapy. The goal of this systematic review is to synthesize the available evidence in the literature regarding the auriculotherapy effects to treat CINV in people with cancer. METHODS: The review will only include randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compare the clinical effects of the auriculotherapy intervention (used alone or as an add-on), with sham auriculotherapy, routine treatment with antiemetic drugs, or other non-pharmacological interventions in patients with cancer with CINV who are undergoing chemotherapy. The outcomes to be evaluated are nausea and vomiting: in acute, delayed, or anticipated stages, when induced by chemotherapy. A comprehensive search for studies will be carried out in these databases: MEDLINE via PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, ICTRP, LILACS, CUMED, IBECS, BVS MTCI Americas, Web of Science, Scopus, PEDro, CNKI, and CBMdisc up until December 31, 2018. Only articles in English, Portuguese, and Spanish will be selected. Two independent reviewers will evaluate full texts, extract data, and assess the risk of bias of eligible articles. The quality of evidence will be assessed using Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE). A meta-analysis will be undertaken to assess the interventions and outcomes' homogeneity, assessing statistical heterogeneity using the Cochran's Q test and quantified using Higgins' inconsistency index. If there is insufficient data for a meta-analysis, a narrative synthesis will be presented. This protocol has been prepared according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) guidelines. DISCUSSION: The results of this systematic review will summarize the strength of evidence for the use of auriculotherapy in the control of CINV of patients with cancer and will be used to identify evidence gaps.

#2521,Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation and acupuncture for primary dysmenorrhoea,"BACKGROUND: Dysmenorrhoea is the occurrence of painful menstrual cramps of the uterus. Medical therapy for dysmenorrhoea commonly consists of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or the oral contraceptive pill both of which work by reducing myometrial (uterine muscle) activity. However, these treatments are accompanied by a number of side effects, making an effective non-pharmacological method of treating dysmenorrhoea of potential value. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is a treatment that has been shown to be effective for pain relief in a variety of conditions. Electrodes are placed on the skin and electric current applied at different pulse rates (frequencies) and intensities is used to stimulate these areas so as to provide pain relief. In dysmenorrhoea. TENS is thought to work by alteration of the body's ability to receive or perceive pain signals rather than by having a direct effect on the uterine contractions. Acupuncture may also be indicated as a useful, non-pharmacological method for treating dysmenorrhoea. Acupuncture is thought to excite receptors or nerve fibres which, through a complicated interaction with mediators such as serotonin and endorphins, blocks pain impulses. Acupuncture typically involves penetration of the skin by fine, solid metallic needles, which are manipulated manually or by electrical stimulation. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness of high and low frequency transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation and acupuncture when compared to each other, placebo, no treatment, or medical treatment for primary dysmenorrhoea. SEARCH STRATEGY: Electronic searches of the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Register of controlled trials, CCTR (Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2001), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Bio extracts, PsycLIT and SPORTDiscus were performed in August 2001 to identify relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs). The Cochrane Complementary Medicine Field's Register of controlled trials (CISCOM) was also searched. Attempts were also made to identify trials from the UK National Research Register, the Clinical Trial Register and the citation lists of review articles and included trials. In most cases, the first or corresponding author of each included trial was contacted for additional information. SELECTION CRITERIA: The inclusion criteria were randomised controlled trials of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation and acupuncture that compared these treatments to each other, placebo, no treatment, or medical treatment for primary dysmenorrhoea. Exclusion criteria were: mild, infrequent or secondary dysmenorrhoea and dysmenorrhoea associated with an IUD. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Nine RCTs were identified that fulfilled the inclusion criteria for this review, seven involving TENS, one acupuncture, and one both treatments. Quality assessment and data extraction were performed independently by two reviewers. Meta analysis was performed using odds ratios for dichotomous outcomes and weighted mean differences for continuous outcomes. Data unsuitable for meta-analysis was reported as descriptive data and was also included for discussion. The outcome measures were pain relief (dichotomous, visual analogue scales, descriptive), adverse effects, use of analgesics additional to treatment and absence from work or school. MAIN RESULTS: Overall high frequency TENS was shown to be more effective for pain relief than placebo TENS. Low frequency TENS was found to be no more effective in reducing pain than placebo TENS. There were conflicting results regarding whether high frequency TENS is more effective than low frequency TENS. One small trial showed acupuncture to be significantly more effective for pain relief than both placebo acupuncture and two no treatment control groups. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: High frequency TENS was found to be effective for the treatment of dysmenorrhoea by a number of small trials. The minor adverse effects reported in one trial requires further investigation. There is insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of low frequency TENS in reducing dysmenorrhoea. There is also insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of acupuncture in reducing dysmenorrhoea, however a single small but methodologically sound trial of acupuncture suggests benefit for this modality.",Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#2522,Interventions for dysphagia and nutritional support in acute and subacute stroke,"BACKGROUND: Dysphagia (swallowing problems) are common after stroke and can cause chest infection and malnutrition. Dysphagic, and malnourished, stroke patients have a poorer outcome. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of interventions for the treatment of dysphagia (swallowing therapy), and nutritional and fluid supplementation, in patients with acute and subacute (within six months from onset) stroke. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (February 2012), MEDLINE (1966 to July 2011), EMBASE (1980 to July 2011), CINAHL (1982 to July 2011) and Conference Proceedings Citation Index- Science (CPCI-S) (1990 to July 2011). We also searched the reference lists of relevant trials and review articles, searched Current Controlled Trials and contacted researchers (July 2011). For the previous version of this review we contacted the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists and equipment manufacturers. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in dysphagic stroke patients, and nutritional supplementation in all stroke patients, where the stroke occurred within six months of enrolment. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently applied the inclusion criteria, assessed trial quality, and extracted data, and resolved any disagreements through discussion with a third review author. We used random-effects models to calculate odds ratios (OR), 95% confidence intervals (95% CI), and mean differences (MD). The primary outcome was functional outcome (death or dependency, or death or disability) at the end of the trial. MAIN RESULTS: We included 33 studies involving 6779 participants.Swallowing therapy: acupuncture, drug therapy, neuromuscular electrical stimulation, pharyngeal electrical stimulation, physical stimulation (thermal, tactile), transcranial direct current stimulation, and transcranial magnetic stimulation each had no significant effect on case fatality or combined death or dependency. Dysphagia at end-of-trial was reduced by acupuncture (number of studies (t) = 4, numbers of participants (n) = 256; OR 0.24; 95% CI 0.13 to 0.46; P < 0.0001; I(2) = 0%) and behavioural interventions (t = 5; n = 423; OR 0.52; 95% CI 0.30 to 0.88; P = 0.01; I(2) = 22%). Route of feeding: percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) and nasogastric tube (NGT) feeding did not differ for case fatality or the composite outcome of death or dependency, but PEG was associated with fewer treatment failures (t = 3; n = 72; OR 0.09; 95% CI 0.01 to 0.51; P = 0.007; I(2) = 0%) and gastrointestinal bleeding (t = 1; n = 321; OR 0.25; 95% CI 0.09 to 0.69; P = 0.007), and higher feed delivery (t = 1; n = 30; MD 22.00; 95% CI 16.15 to 27.85; P < 0.00001) and albumin concentration (t = 3; n = 63; MD 4.92 g/L; 95% CI 0.19 to 9.65; P = 0.04; I(2) = 58%). Although looped NGT versus conventional NGT feeding did not differ for end-of-trial case fatality or death or dependency, feed delivery was higher with looped NGT (t = 1; n = 104; MD 18.00%; 95% CI 6.66 to 29.34; P = 0.002). Timing of feeding: there was no difference for case fatality, or death or dependency, with early feeding as compared to late feeding. Fluid supplementation: there was no difference for case fatality, or death or dependency, with fluid supplementation. Nutritional supplementation: there was no difference for case fatality, or death or dependency, with nutritional supplementation. However, nutritional supplementation was associated with reduced pressure sores (t = 2; n = 4125; OR 0.56; 95% CI 0.32 to 0.96; P = 0.03; I(2) = 0%), and, by definition, increased energy intake (t = 3; n = 174; MD 430.18 kcal/day; 95% CI 141.61 to 718.75; P = 0.003; I(2) = 91%) and protein intake (t = 3; n = 174; MD 17.28 g/day; 95% CI 1.99 to 32.56; P = 0.03; I(2) = 92%). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There remains insufficient data on the effect of swallowing therapy, feeding, and nutritional and fluid supplementation on functional outcome and death in dysphagic patients with acute or subacute stroke. Behavioural interventions and acupuncture reduced dysphagia, and pharyngeal electrical stimulation reduced pharyngeal transit time. Compared with NGT feeding, PEG reduced treatment failures and gastrointestinal bleeding, and had higher feed delivery and albumin concentration. Nutritional supplementation was associated with reduced pressure sores, and increased energy and protein intake.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#2526,Effect of He's Santong Needling Method on Dysphagia after Stroke: A Study Protocol for a Prospective Randomized Controlled Pilot Trial,"BACKGROUND: Dysphagia is a common complication of stroke, affecting up to 78% of stroke patients. The existence of dysphagia after stroke has been associated with an increased risk for pulmonary complications and even mortality. Previous studies have shown that acupuncture could be potential therapeutic method for treatment of dysphagia after stroke. A prospective randomized controlled pilot trial is designed to evaluate the effect of He's Santong needling method on dysphagia after stroke. METHODS AND DESIGN: Sixty eligible participants will be recruited and randomly assigned into treatment group (He's Santong needling method and swallowing rehabilitation training) and control group (swallowing rehabilitation training) in a 1:1 ratio. All treatments will be provided everyday on weekdays with a two-day interval at the weekend, during a total treatment course of four weeks. The Penetration-Aspiration Scale with Fiberoptic Endoscopic Examination of Swallowing will be assessed at baseline and endpoint (Week 4) as primary outcomes. The Saitoh's classification score, Swallowing-Related Quality of Life score, the Modified Mann Assessment of Swallowing Ability score, and Surface Electromyography will be evaluated at baseline and endpoint as secondary outcomes. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The trial protocol has been approved by the Research Ethical Committee of Beijing Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine Affiliated to Capital Medical University on 9 May 2017 (ethical batch number: 2017BL-013-02).

#2527,"Therapeutic effect of acupuncture on post-stroke dysphagia: A multicenter, randomized controlled trial","BACKGROUND: Dysphagia is a common complication of stroke, significantly affecting patient prognosis and quality of life. Acupuncture is commonly used for treating post-stroke dysphagia in China, often combined with traditional swallowing rehabilitation training. However, the therapeutic effect of acupuncture alone on post-stroke dysphagia remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: To compare the clinical efficacy of acupuncture and traditional swallowing rehabilitation training in patients with post-stroke dysphagia. METHOD: A multicenter, evaluator-blind, randomized controlled trial was conducted to recruit participants with post-stroke dysphagia. The experimental group received acupuncture treatment, whereas the control group received traditional swallowing rehabilitation training for 2 weeks. The Standardized Swallowing Assessment score and modified Barthel Index were compared between groups 1 and 2 weeks after the intervention. Surface electromyography (sEMG) was used to quantitatively evaluate the electromyographic activity in the suprahyoid and infrahyoid hyoid muscle groups. RESULT: Overall, 254 participants were included. After 1 week of intervention, there was no significant between-group difference in efficacy (p > 0.05). After 2 weeks of intervention, the Standardized Swallowing Assessment score of the experimental group showed a greater decrease (-1.56, 95 %CI [-2.83, -0.29], p < 0.05). There was no significant between-group difference in the modified Barthel Index (2.00, 95 %CI [-2.00, 6.00], p > 0.05). sEMG analysis showed that after 2 weeks of intervention, participants in the experimental group experienced greater increase in the root mean square value of the suprahyoid muscle group during fluid swallowing (1.02, 95 %CI [0.11, 2.27], p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Acupuncture may improve the swallowing function in patients with post-stroke dysphagia, offering therapeutic advantages for patients with pharyngeal phase dysphagia.

#2530,A meta-analysis of the efficacy of acupuncture in treating dysphagia in patients with a stroke,"BACKGROUND: Dysphagia, or deglutition difficulty, is a common manifestation in patients with a stroke and its management is an important aspect of rehabilitation. Acupuncture, a complementary and alternative therapy, is the subject of growing public interest for treatment of stroke. OBJECTIVE: A meta-analysis was performed to study the effect of acupuncture for treatment of dysphagia in patients affected by a stroke. METHODS: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing acupuncture treatment with non-acupuncture treatment of dysphagia in patients with a stroke were identified from the databases of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library and CBM disc (China Biological Medicine Database). Eligible investigations were included and data on the effectiveness of acupuncture were extracted and synthesised by meta-analysis using RevMan 5.1.4. Results were expressed as OR for dichotomous data; 95% CIs were also calculated. RESULTS: Seventy-two RCTs (3208 patients in the treatment group and 2926 patients in the control group) were identified. Details of randomisation and blinding were not reported and information on withdrawals and dropouts was missing in most of included reports. Meta-analysis showed that the effectiveness of treatment in the group receiving acupuncture was higher than that in the non-acupuncture group (OR=5.17, 95% CI 4.18 to 6.38; p<0.00001). However, the study quality was generally low and of insufficient quality to make recommendations about using acupuncture in the rehabilitation of patients with dysphagia due to stroke. CONCLUSIONS: Acupuncture might be beneficial in the rehabilitation of patients with dysphagia caused by stroke, and the evidence justifies future high-quality studies.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#2533,Acupuncture for dyspnea and breathing physiology in chronic respiratory diseases: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials,"BACKGROUND: Dyspnea, a common symptom of chronic respiratory diseases (CRDs), is closely linked to higher levels of functional impairment and death, leading to significant societal and financial challenges. Despite numerous clinical trials and systematic reviews suggested the potential benefits of acupuncture for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer, there is currently insufficient evidence to conclusively prove its effectiveness in alleviating dyspnea in patients with CRDs. METHODS: To compile and evaluate the existing data on the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture for managing dyspnea in CRDs. Randomized controlled trials investigating acupuncture for the treatment of dyspnea in patients with CRDs, such as COPD, lung cancer, asthma, bronchiectasis, interstitial lung disease, chronic pulmonary heart disease and bronchitis, were searched and retrieved from five electronic databases in English or Chinese. RESULTS: A total of 23 studies meeting the inclusion criteria were found in databases, covering various CRDs such as COPD, lung cancer, and asthma. A meta-analysis that compared acupuncture to a control group (which included no acupuncture and sham acupuncture) found significant advantages for acupuncture in reducing dyspnea severity (P = 0.0003), increasing 6MWD (P < 0.00001), improving quality of life measured by St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (P = 0.03) and karnofsky performance status score (P < 0.00001). No significance was found in breathing physiology represented by FEV(1) (P = 0.34) and FVC (P = 0.15). There was a comparable incidence of negative outcomes in both groups (P = 0.07). Results were consistent when compared to sham acupuncture. In addition, subgroup analyses were also consistent when different diseases or types of acupuncture were analyzed. CONCLUSIONS: Acupuncture may be an effective and safe non-pharmacological complementary intervention to relief dyspnea for patients with CRDs. Nevertheless, research with high quality and large sample sizes is needed for further investigation.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#2535,A randomised study comparing the effectiveness of acupuncture or morphine versus the combination for the relief of dyspnoea in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer and mesothelioma,"BACKGROUND: Dyspnoea is one of the commonest symptoms of lung cancer. Opioids can reduce dyspnoea. This study investigates acupuncture for relief of breathlessness in lung cancer. METHODS: We performed a single-centre, randomised phase II study of 173 patients with non-small cell lung cancer or mesothelioma with dyspnoea score of ≥4 on visual analogue scale (VAS). Randomisation was to acupuncture alone (A), morphine alone (M) or both (AM). Acupuncture was administered at upper sternal, thoracic paravertebral, trapezius trigger points and LI4. Manubrial semi-permanent acupuncture studs were inserted and massaged when symptomatic. Arm A patients received rescue morphine. Primary end-point was proportion of patients achieving ≥1.5 improvement in VAS dyspnoea at 4 h. Measurements continued to day 14 and included VAS relaxation, line analogue rating (Lar) anxiety, hospital anxiety and depression and European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer quality-of-life scores. RESULTS: Dyspnoea VAS improved ≥1.5 in 74%, 60% and 66% of arms A, M and AM, respectively, and was maintained in 45% at 2 weeks. There was no statistically significant difference between arms. VAS relaxation improved in arms A (1.06 points) and AM (1.48 points) compared to arm M (-0.19 points, p<0.001). At 7 d, the Lar anxiety score improved in arm A (1.5 points), arm AM (1.2 points) and arm M (no change, p=0.003). Fewer patients received at least one morphine dose in arm A compared with arm M or AM (21% versus 87% versus 87%, respectively, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: A, M and AM were effective in relieving dyspnoea. Acupuncture relieved anxiety and was morphine sparing, providing an alternative to morphine.",No,No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No
#2549,Short-term effect of electroacupuncture on rehabilitation after arthroscopic triangular fibrocartilage complex repair: a randomised study,"BACKGROUND: Electroacupuncture (EA) alleviates chronic pain and acute postoperative pain after several surgical procedures. However, whether EA facilitates postoperative functional recovery after arthroscopic surgery has yet to be determined. This study investigated the short-term effect of EA on a rehabilitation course after arthroscopic triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) repair. METHODS: Forty-two patients undergoing arthroscopic TFCC repair were randomised to an EA group (n = 19) or control group (n = 23). In the EA group, patients received EA treatment and standard active rehabilitation for 4 weeks. In the control group, patients received standard active rehabilitation for 4 weeks. At the end of the treatment and at the follow-up visit 4 weeks after the treatment, Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) scores, wrist range of motion (ROM), handgrip strength, and key pinch strength were collected and analysed. RESULTS: The EA group improved significantly than the control group in terms of DASH scores, all wrist motion arcs, and key pinch strength (P < 0.05) at the end of the 4-week treatment and the follow-up visit another 4 weeks later. CONCLUSION: Patients treated with 4 weeks of EA after the arthroscopic TFCC repair had better wrist ROM and DASH scores than patients of control group.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes
#2552,Electro-acupuncture for pain relief after nasal septoplasty: a randomized controlled study,"BACKGROUND: Electro-acupuncture (EA) can be effective in some pain conditions, but still there have been no randomized controlled studies of EA for treatment of acute postoperative pain in nasal septoplasty. Therefore, we did a study to test whether EA of specific points is superior to sham acupuncture for complementary analgesia after nasal septoplasty. METHODS: Ninety (90) patients with an American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) physical status of I-II scheduled for elective septoplasty were randomly allocated to acupuncture group or control group. Postoperative pain was treated with intravenous meperidine. The time to the first analgesic request, and pain intensity on a 100-mm visual analogue scale (VAS-100) were used to evaluate postoperative pain, and the amount of postoperative meperidine and incidence of analgesia related to side-effects were recorded. RESULTS: Postoperative pain intensity on VAS-100 and respiratory depression were similar in both groups (p > 0.05), but nausea and vomiting were less in the acupuncture group than in the control group (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Findings from our study demonstrate that both uses of EA and 0.1 mg/kg IV morphine given intraoperatively resulted in a similar postoperative pain score, and meperidine was not given in any patient in the two groups during postoperative period because the VAS scores of all patients were less than 40 mm.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes
#2573,Imaging the functional connectivity of the Periaqueductal Gray during genuine and sham electroacupuncture treatment,"BACKGROUND: Electroacupuncture (EA) is currently one of the most popular acupuncture modalities. However, the continuous stimulation characteristic of EA treatment presents challenges to the use of conventional functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) approaches for the investigation of neural mechanisms mediating treatment response because of the requirement for brief and intermittent stimuli in event related or block designed task paradigms. A relatively new analysis method, functional connectivity fMRI (fcMRI), has great potential for studying continuous treatment modalities such as EA. In a previous study, we found that, compared with sham acupuncture, EA can significantly reduce Periaqueductal Gray (PAG) activity when subsequently evoked by experimental pain. Given the PAG's important role in mediating acupuncture analgesia, in this study we investigated functional connectivity with the area of the PAG we previously identified and how that connectivity was affected by genuine and sham EA. RESULTS: Forty-eight subjects, who were randomly assigned to receive either genuine or sham EA paired with either a high or low expectancy manipulation, completed the study. Direct comparison of each treatment mode's functional connectivity revealed: significantly greater connectivity between the PAG, left posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), and precuneus for the contrast of genuine minus sham; significantly greater connectivity between the PAG and right anterior insula for the contrast of sham minus genuine; no significant differences in connectivity between different contrasts of the two expectancy levels. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate the intrinsic functional connectivity changes among key brain regions in the pain matrix and default mode network during genuine EA compared with sham EA. We speculate that continuous genuine EA stimulation can modify the coupling of spontaneous activity in brain regions that play a role in modulating pain perception.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes
#2574,Electroacupuncture at ST36 acupoint regulates stem cells during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis,"BACKGROUND: Electroacupuncture (EA) is given to assist in the treatment of MS, which is an effective therapeutic method. However, the therapy mechanism of EA related to stem cells in the treatment of MS is not yet known. In this study, we used a classic animal model of multiple sclerosis: experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) to evaluate the therapeutic effect of EA at Zusanli (ST36) acupoint in EAE and shed light on its potential roles in the effects of stem cells in vivo. METHODS: The EAE animal models were established. From the first day after immunization, EAE model mice received EA at ST36 acupoint, named the EA group. The weight and clinical score of the three groups were recorded for 28 days. The demyelination, inflammatory cell infiltration, and markers of neural stem cells (NSCs), hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were compared. RESULTS: We showed that EAE mice treated with EA at ST36 acupoint, were suppressed in demyelination and inflammatory cell infiltration, and thus decreased clinical score and weight loss and mitigated the development of EAE when compared with the EAE group. Moreover, our data revealed that the proportions of NSCs, HSCs, and MSCs increased in the EA group compared with the EAE group. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggested that EA at ST36 acupoint was an effective nonpharmacological therapeutic protocol that not only reduced the CNS demyelination and inflammatory cell infiltration in EAE disease but also increased the proportions of various stem cells. Further study is necessary to better understand how EA at the ST36 acupoint affects EAE.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#2585,Transcriptomic Insights into Different Stimulation Intensity of Electroacupuncture in Treating COPD in Rat Models,"BACKGROUND: Electroacupuncture (EA), with varying stimulation intensities, has demonstrated therapeutic potentials in both animal and clinical studies for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, a comprehensive investigation of the intensity-related effects, particularly 1mA and 3mA of EA, and the underlying mechanisms remains lacking. METHODS: A COPD rat model was established by prolonged exposure to cigarette smoke and intermittent intratracheal instillation of lipopolysaccharide. EA treatment was administered at acupoints BL13 (Feishu) and ST36 (Zusanli), 20 minutes daily for 2 weeks, with intensities of 1mA and 3mA. EA effectiveness was evaluated by pulmonary function, histopathological change, serum level of inflammatory cytokines, and level of oxidative stress markers in serum and lung tissues. Transcriptome profiling and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) were performed to reveal gene expression patterns and identify hub genes. Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and Western blot (WB) were performed to detect the mRNA and protein expression levels, respectively. RESULTS: EA at both 1mA and 3mA exerted differing therapeutic effects by improving lung function and reducing inflammation and oxidative stress in COPD rats. Transcriptome analysis revealed distinct expression patterns between the two groups, functionally corresponding to shared and intensity-specific (1mA and 3mA) enriched pathways. Eight candidate genes were identified, including Aqp9, Trem1, Mrc1, and Gpnmb that were downregulated by EA and upregulated in COPD. Notably, Msr1 and Slc26a4 exclusively downregulated in EA-1mA, while Pde3a and Bmp6 upregulated solely in EA-3mA. WGCNA constructed 5 key modules and elucidated the module-trait relationship, with the aforementioned 8 genes being highlighted. Additionally, their mRNA and protein levels were validated by RT-qPCR and WB. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated that 1mA and 3mA intensities induce distinct gene expression patterns at the transcriptional level, associated with shared and 1mA vs 3mA-specific enriched pathways. Genes Mrc1, Gpnmb, Trem1, and Aqp9 emerge as promising targets, and further studies are needed to elucidate their functional consequences in COPD.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#2595,Electromoxibustion for knee osteoarthritis in older adults: A pilot randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Electromoxibustion devices are commercially available and can be self-administered by patients. Nevertheless, little is known about the effectiveness and potential burn injury of these devices as this topic is under-investigated. OBJECTIVE: To assess the preliminary effects and safety of an electromoxibustion (EM) device for improving knee pain and joint functions in older adults with knee osteoarthritis (KOA). DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS AND INTERVENTION: This was a pilot two-armed assessor-blinded randomized controlled trial to assess the effects of electromoxibustion (EM) on older adults with KOA. A total of 38 subjects aged 60 or above, with KOA for 3 months or above were recruited. Participants were randomized to the EM group or the knee health education group. The intervention group (n = 21) received 12 sessions of EM spanning across four weeks, while the control group (n = 17) received two sessions of knee health education. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome included the pain severity Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) at baseline and week 4. Secondary outcomes included the Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), Short-Form Six-Dimension (SF6D), Timed Up & Go Test (TUG) and Fast Speed Gait (FSG). RESULTS: Both groups showed a decreasing trend in knee pain intensity by NRS at post-intervention. There were also trends of improvement in the WOMAC score, TUG score, FGS test score and SF-6D score at week 4. Only a small between-group effect size (d = 0.13) was found, but medium between-group effects sizes were found in the WOMAC total score (d = 0.40) and WOMAC functional sub-score (d = 0.51). However, the differences were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: This study suggested that EM may be beneficial for KOA in older adults, particularly in terms of improving knee function. Replication of similar studies in larger RCTs is warranted to confirm the effectiveness of EM on reducing pain and knee function of older adults with KOA.

#2609,Acupuncture for pain in endometriosis,"BACKGROUND: Endometriosis is a prevalent gynaecological condition, significantly affecting women's lives. Clinical presentations may vary from absence of symptoms to complaints of chronic pelvic pain, most notably dysmenorrhoea. The management of pain in endometriosis is currently inadequate. Acupuncture has been studied in gynaecological disorders but its effectiveness for pain in endometriosis is uncertain. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture for pain in endometriosis.  SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group (MSDG) Specialised Register of controlled trials, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED, PsycINFO, CNKI and TCMDS (from inception to 2010) and reference lists of retrieved articles. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised single or double-blind controlled trials enrolling women of reproductive age with a laparoscopically confirmed diagnosis of endometriosis and comparing acupuncture (body, scalp or auricular) to either placebo or sham, no treatment, conventional therapies or Chinese herbal medicine. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Three authors independently assessed risk of bias and extracted data; we contacted study authors for additional information. Meta-analyses were not performed as only one study was included. The primary outcome measure was decrease in pain from endometriosis. Secondary outcome measures included improvement in quality of life scores, pregnancy rate, adverse effects and rate of endometriosis recurrence. MAIN RESULTS: Twenty-four studies were identified that involved acupuncture for endometriosis; however only one trial, enrolling 67 participants, met all the inclusion criteria. The single included trial defined pain scores and cure rates according to the Guideline for Clinical Research on New Chinese Medicine. Dysmenorrhoea scores were lower in the acupuncture group (mean difference -4.81 points, 95% confidence interval -6.25 to -3.37, P < 0.00001) using the 15-point Guideline for Clinical Research on New Chinese Medicine for Treatment of Pelvic Endometriosis scale. The total effective rate ('cured', 'significantly effective' or 'effective') for auricular acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine was 91.9% and 60%, respectively (risk ratio 3.04, 95% confidence interval 1.65 to 5.62, P = 0.0004). The improvement rate did not differ significantly between auricular acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine for cases of mild to moderate dysmenorrhoea, whereas auricular acupuncture did significantly reduce pain in cases of severe dysmenorrhoea. Data were not available for secondary outcomes measures. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The evidence to support the effectiveness of acupuncture for pain in endometriosis is limited, based on the results of only a single study that was included in this review. This review highlights the necessity for developing future studies that are well-designed, double-blinded, randomised controlled trials that assess various types of acupuncture in comparison to conventional therapies.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#2610,Manual acupuncture plus usual care versus usual care alone in the treatment of endometriosis-related chronic pelvic pain: study protocol for a randomised controlled feasibility study,"BACKGROUND: Endometriosis is the most common cause of chronic pelvic pain worldwide. Non-surgical treatments are effective for only 30-50% of women and have a significant side effect burden that leads to high discontinuation rates. Surgery can be effective but is expensive and invasive, and symptoms tend to recur within 5 years. There is early evidence that acupuncture may be effective in treating endometriosis-related chronic pelvic pain, showing clinically significant analgesia. Both levels of inflammation and pain processing have been shown to be altered in women with chronic pelvic pain. Acupuncture has been shown to reduce inflammation and change central pain processing in other conditions, but research on women with endometriosis is currently lacking. The aim of this feasibility study is to provide data on recruitment rates, retention, appropriateness of outcome measures, minimal clinically important difference in numeric rated scales for pain and the potential effect of acupuncture on pain processing and markers of inflammation in endometriosis-related CPP. METHODS: We will include women aged 18-45 years with a diagnosis of endometriosis via laparoscopy in the past 5 years. A total of 30 participants will be recruited and randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to receive acupuncture or usual care. Women in the acupuncture group will receive two 45-min treatment sessions per week for 8 weeks (total of 16 sessions). Women in the usual care group will continue with their current treatment regimen. The primary feasibility outcomes are recruitment rates, retention rates and the safety and acceptability of the intervention; secondary patient-centred outcomes include a change in 0-10 daily pelvic pain ratings, the Endometriosis Health Profile 30 (EHP-30) and changes in conditioned pain modulation, resting and task-related EEG activity and inflammatory markers. Analyses will be performed blind to group allocation. DISCUSSION: This is a two-armed, assessor blind, randomised controlled feasibility trial. Data will be compared at baseline and trial completion 8 weeks later. Outcomes from this feasibility study will inform a larger, fully powered clinical trial should the treatment show trends for potential effectiveness.

#2621,Comprehensive preventive treatments for episodic migraine: a systematic review of randomized clinical trials,"BACKGROUND: Episodic migraine is a prevalent and disabling neurological disorder with a significant impact on quality of life and productivity. Preventive treatment aims to reduce the frequency, intensity, and disability associated with migraine attacks. However, the comparative efficacy and safety of available preventive strategies remain insufficiently addressed in the literature, especially in low- and middle-income countries. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of pharmacological and non-pharmacological preventive treatments for episodic migraine through a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). METHODS: Following PRISMA guidelines, a comprehensive literature search was conducted across Wiley Online, BVS, MEDLINE, and OVID databases through November 2024. Eligible studies were RCTs comparing preventive treatments with placebo or active comparators in adults with episodic migraine. This review was not registered in PROSPERO due to institutional constraints at the time of project initiation. Primary outcomes included changes in monthly migraine days (MMD), monthly headache days (MHD), acute medication days (AMD), adverse events (AE) and serious adverse events (SAE). Meta-analysis was performed using fixed- or random-effects models depending on heterogeneity. RESULTS: Thirty-nine RCTs involving over 15,000 patients were included. Anti-CGRP monoclonal antibodies and gepants demonstrated the most consistent reduction in MMD (-3.2 to -4.4 days) with favorable tolerability. Traditional agents such as topiramate and propranolol showed modest efficacy with higher AE rates. Combination therapies offered superior MMD reductions (up to -5.1 days) but were associated with increased side effects. Non-pharmacological interventions (e.g., neuromodulation, acupuncture) showed promising results but lacked standardization. Meta-analysis of allopathic treatments revealed a significant MMD reduction vs. placebo (-1.25 days; 95% CI - 1.47 to -1.04; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: CGRP-targeted therapies and gepants are effective first-line options for episodic migraine prevention. Combinations may enhance efficacy but at the cost of tolerability. Non-pharmacological treatments represent useful adjuncts. These findings support individualized, multimodal preventive strategies, particularly in resource-limited settings. However, interpretation should consider potential publication and language bias, as well as the short follow-up duration in many included trials.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#2622,"Subjective well-being in patients with chronic tension-type headache: effect of acupuncture, physical training, and relaxation training","BACKGROUND: Episodic tension-type headache is a common problem affecting approximately 2 of 3 of the population. The origin of tension-type headache is multifactorial, but the pathogenesis is still unclear. In some individuals episodic tension-type headache transforms into chronic tension-type headache (CTTH). Subjective symptoms related to the central nervous system might affect patients subjective well-being and quality of life. OBJECTIVE: This study compared 3 nonpharmacologic treatments; acupuncture, relaxation training, and physical training on subjective well-being in patients with CTTH. METHODS: Ninety consecutive patients with CTTH were randomly allocated to acupuncture, relaxation training, or physical training. At baseline 88 age-matched and sex-matched healthy controls were compared with the patients with CTTH. Subjective, central nervous system-related symptoms that might affect patients' subjective well-being and quality of life were assessed with the Minor Symptom Evaluation Profile, which contains 24 self-administered standardized items with visual analog scale responses. Fifteen items are categorized into 3 dimensions: contentment, vitality, and sleep. Assessments were made before treatment, immediately after, and 3 and 6 months after the last treatment. RESULTS: Baseline values of the total score of the 24 items and the 3 dimensions were generally lower in patients with tension-type headache compared with the reference group. No significant differences were found among the 3 treatment groups during the baseline period. All treatments proportionally improved the subjective, central nervous system-related symptoms in patients with CTTH. The 3-month follow-up, the total score of the Minor Symptom Evaluation Profile was significantly improved in the physical training group compared with the acupuncture group (P=0.036). Total mean over period was also highest in the physical training group compared with the acupuncture group (P=0.025). The vitality and sleep dimension was significantly improved at the 6-month follow-up in the relaxation training group compared with the acupuncture group (P=0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Physical training and relaxation training seem to be preferable nonpharmacologic treatments for improvement of central nervous system-related symptoms and subjective well-being for patients with CTTH.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes
#2624,The safety and efficacy of acupuncture for erectile dysfunction: A network meta-analysis,"BACKGROUND: Erectile dysfunction is a common male disease, the constant pace of life, increasing pressure on life, and changes in diet, living environment, lifestyle, etc., lead to an increase in the number of patients with erectile dysfunction (ED). Acupuncture has been widely used in clinical trials of ED in recent years. There are many clinical trials that confirm that acupuncture can improve male erectile function. This study used a network meta-analysis (NMA) to compare the effectiveness and safety of different forms of acupuncture on ED. METHODS: We will search for PubMed, Cochrane Library, AMED, EMBASE, WorldSciNet; Nature, Science online and China Journal Full-text Database (China National Knowledge Infrastructure), China Biomedical Literature CD-ROM Database (CBM), and related randomized controlled trials (RCTs) included in the China Resources Database. The time is limited from the construction of the library to December 2018. The quality of the included RCTs will be evaluated with the risk of bias tool and evidence will be evaluated by Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation.

#2663,Effects of Self-Administered Acupressure on Fatigue Following Traumatic Brain Injury: A Randomized Controlled Trial,"BACKGROUND: Fatigue is a common symptom after a traumatic brain injury (TBI) and may persist for weeks or years. However, nonpharmacological management strategies for fatigue alleviations are almost nonexistent; thus, effective fatigue management programs are needed urgently. PURPOSES: We aimed to evaluate the effects of self-administered acupressure programs on post-TBI fatigue and heart rate variability and identify the possible correlation between the improvements in fatigue symptoms and the changes in heart rate variability. DESIGN: This randomized controlled trial included 2-point acupressure (TPA; n = 27), 5-point acupressure (FPA; n = 27), and usual care (UC, control; n = 27) groups who underwent several assessments before and after the study intervention. Heart rate variability was evaluated at baseline, weeks 2 and 3, and treatment completion. METHODS: The TPA and FPA groups self-administered acupressure (3 minutes per acupoint; bilateral), thrice daily for 4 weeks, whereas the UC group received routine treatment without acupressure. RESULTS: Both the TPA and FPA groups exhibited substantial improvements in fatigue symptoms compared with the baseline findings in the UC group. In addition, the TPA and FPA groups exhibited increased high-frequency power and mean number of times per hour in which the changes in successive normal sinus intervals (RR) gradually exceeded 50 ms (pNN50). Changes in high-frequency power and pNN50 were correlated with improvements in post-TBI fatigue symptoms. CONCLUSION: Acupressure may alleviate chronic fatigue and enhance parasympathetic activity in TBI survivors. The enhancement of parasympathetic activity may be correlated with improvements in post-TBI fatigue symptoms. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Healthcare providers should incorporate self-administered acupressure into the care plans for TBI survivors to improve their fatigue symptoms.",No,No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No
#2674,The effect of acupressure on the level of fatigue in hemodialysis patients,"BACKGROUND: Fatigue is one problem that is seen in high numbers in hemodialysis patients. Fatigue decreases quality of life by negatively affecting an individual's daily performance, activities, professional life, relations with family and friends, and treatment process. OBJECTIVE: This study was carried out to determine the effect of acupressure on the level of fatigue in hemodialysis patients. METHODS/DESIGN: The study was conducted as experimental research with an acupressure (intervention) group and a control group. SETTING: The research, for which an ethics committee's approval and institutional permission was obtained, was conducted in two central provinces of Turkey, Nevşehir and Aksaray, at two hemodialysis centers with similar characteristics. PARTICIPANTS: The research was completed with a total of 118 participants (52 in the intervention group and 66 in the control group) who met the inclusion criteria. INTERVENTIONS: A total of 12 acupressure sessions, 3 ×/wk for 1 mo, were performed for all participants in the intervention group, as required by the acupressure application protocol, applying acupressure at the Stomach 36 (ST-36), Gallbladder 34 (GB-34), Spleen 6 (SP-6), and Kidney 1 (K-1) acupuncture points with a transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) acupuncture pen (XFT-320 acupuncture pen, Shenzhen Xunfegtong Electronics Co, Ltd, Shenzhen, China). PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: A visual analog scale (VAS) for fatigue and the Piper Fatigue Scale (PFS) were used to evaluate the fatigue level of the participants before and after the acupressure application. RESULTS: After the acupressure applications for 1 mo, the subscale and total fatigue scores for the VAS (P < .001) and PFS were lower (P < .05) for participants in the intervention group compared to the controls, except for the cognitive subscale on the PFS (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: The study found that acupressure, applied using an acupuncture pen, was effective in decreasing fatigue in hemodialysis patients. Based on this result, the current research team suggests that hemodialysis patients and nurses should be informed about acupressure application so as to extend the use of acupressure in reducing fatigue symptoms.",No,No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No
#2687,The Consistency between Registered Acupuncture-Moxibustion Clinical Studies and Their Published Studies and Update Status of Registered Information,"BACKGROUND: Few studies have analyzed the consistency between registered acupuncture-moxibustion clinical studies and their published research results as well as their update status of registered information. METHODS: We searched for acupuncture-moxibustion clinical studies that were registered at the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform between 2013 and 2015 and collected data regarding their characteristics and update status. Published results of these registered studies were identified and compared with registered information. RESULTS: A total of 425 registered acupuncture-moxibustion clinical studies were included; 379 (89.2%) of them were interventional studies, and the remaining 46 (10.8%) were observational studies. Forty-six studies (10.8%) were found to have published results, and 51 published articles were identified. Overall, 73.2% (311) of registered studies did not update the research status in time; 46.6% (198) stopped updating before recruiting; 21.6% (92) stopped updating after recruiting; and 4.9% (21) stopped updating after completion. Regarding the 46 studies with published results, 29 (63.0%) were considered to be affected by reporting bias. These reporting biases predominantly involved the omission of some predefined outcomes or endpoints (16 studies), contradictions regarding descriptions of sample sizes (9 studies), discrepancies in treatment measurements or group distribution (7 studies), and inconsistent treatment durations (4 studies). When compared with other studies, significant and various reporting biases could also be commonly found in fields other than acupuncture-moxibustion. CONCLUSIONS: There were many discrepancies between registered information and published reports on acupuncture-moxibustion, which could also be commonly observed in other fields. Moreover, a large proportion of registered studies did not update their research status in time. Efforts should be made to improve the reporting quality and timely updates. <title>Hintergrund</title>Es gibt nur wenige Studien, in denen die Übereinstimmung zwischen den registrierten klinischen Studien zur Akupunktur und Moxibustion mit den veröffentlichten Studienergebnissen und dem Aktualisierungsstand der Informationen im Register untersucht wurde.<title>Methoden</title>Wir suchten nach klinischen Studien zur Akupunktur und Moxibustion, die zwischen 2013 und 2015 auf der International Clinical Trials Registry Platform der Weltgesundheitsorganisation registriert wurden, und erhoben Daten zu ihren Merkmalen und ihrem Aktualisierungsstand.

#2695,Electroacupuncture Mitigates TRPV1 Overexpression in the Central Nervous System Associated with Fibromyalgia in Mice,"BACKGROUND: Fibromyalgia (FM) is characterized by chronic pain, significantly affecting the quality of life and functional capabilities of patients. In addition to pain, patients may experience insomnia, chronic fatigue, depression, anxiety, and headaches, further complicating their overall well-being. The Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) receptor responds to various noxious stimuli and plays a key role in regulating pain sensitivity and inflammation. Thus, targeting TRPV1 may provide analgesic and anti-inflammatory benefits. This study investigates the efficacy of electroacupuncture (EA) in alleviating chronic pain in FM through TRPV1 and its downstream molecules in the central nervous system (CNS). METHODS: To model FM, we subjected mice to intermittent cold stress (ICS) for three days. The study comprised five rodent groups: Control (CON), ICS, ICS + EA, ICS + Sham EA, and ICS + KO (TRPV1 knockout mice). RESULTS: Our findings revealed that ICS induced allodynia and hyperalgesia in mice by day four, persisting until day 21. EA at 2 Hz and TRPV1 KO significantly decreased both mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity (Withdrawal-Day 14: 2.43 ± 0.19 g; Day 21: 5.88 ± 0.47 g, n = 6, p < 0.05; Latency-Day 14: 2.77 ± 0.22 s; Day 21: 5.85 ± 0.41 s, n = 6, p < 0.05). In contrast, sham EA did not produce significant effects. Additionally, TRPV1 and several pain-related proteins were significantly elevated in the thalamus, somatosensory cortex (SSC), medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), hippocampus, hypothalamus, cerebellum regions V (CB V), VI (CB VI) and VII (CB VII) after the ICS model. Both EA at the ST36 acupoint and TRPV1 KO mice showed diminished overexpression of pain-related proteins, with the sham EA group showing no significant changes compared to the ICS group. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic widespread pain was reduced by EA and TRPV1 KO, with the effects of EA on the TRPV1 pain pathway clearly evident in the CNS after 21 days.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#2703,Influence of comorbidities on improvement of fibromyalgia symptoms when treated with acupuncture: a short report,"BACKGROUND: Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is associated with chronic widespread pain, mood alteration, and disability. A definitive treatment plan has not been identified. The genesis of FMS is unclear and generally occurs in women. PURPOSE: To determine whether patient-identified most disruptive comorbidity (MDC) secondary to FMS may have mediated recovery for individual patients. This is a probative analysis of data from an effectiveness study published in the March 2006 issue of Alternative Therapies in Health and Medicine. (2006;12(2):34-41.) METHODS: The American College ofRheumatology (ACR) criteria for FMS was used in participant selection; 21 participants completed the study. RESULTS: The original outcome study indicated significant changes on standardized measures using specific points and numbers of treatment within an 8-week period. The preliminary data on influence ofMDC on improvement were differential related to self-report MDC by patients.

#2744,Electroacupuncture versus 5-HT4 receptor agonist for functional constipation: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials,"BACKGROUND: Functional constipation (FC) has been found as a chronic gastrointestinal disease that is commonly diagnosed in patients. However, patients have a low satisfaction level with the treatment of constipation drugs (e.g., 5-HT4 agonists). A meta-analysis was performed to compare the efficacy and safety between electroacupuncture and 5-HT4 agonists. METHODS: The included study were randomized controlled trials (RCTs), in which EA was used in the experimental group and 5-HT4 receptor agonist was used in the control group. Four English databases (PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Embase) and 4 Chinese databases (China National Knowledge Infrastructure, CBM, WanFang, VIP) were searched. Relevant studies retrieved were published before September 30, 2024. The risk of bias was assessed by tool of Cochrane and GRADEpro. The Review Manager 5.4 was used for analyzing Data analysis, and Endnote X9 for screening studies. RESULTS: In this paper, we included 12 studies, involving 1473 participants. We found that EA significantly improved patient assessment of cab quality of life questionnaire (PAC-QOL) (MD = -0.52, P = .03), self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) (MD = -3.00, P < .00001) and self-rating depression scale (SDS) (MD = -4.13, P < .00001) compared with 5-HT4 receptor agonists. In addition, we failed to identify any significant difference in Stool consistency, the number of weekly complete spontaneous bowel movements and weekly spontaneous bowel movements (SBMs) between the 2 groups. CONCLUSION: EA has been indicated to be better than 5-HT4 receptor agonists since it can more effectively improve FC patients' life quality and mental state without an increased risk of adverse even. However, the previous evidence is characterized by low quality and small sample size, which should be further confirmed by high-quality and large-sample multicenter RCTs.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#2745,A randomized controlled trial of acupuncture to treat functional constipation: design and protocol,"BACKGROUND: Functional constipation (FC) is a common functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) which has a major impact on the quality of life. Acupuncture is widely used as an alternative and complementary medicine (CAM) for FC, but the available evidence of its effectiveness is scarce. Therefore, we will perform a randomized controlled trial to determine whether acupuncture improves symptom and quality of life in FC patients more effectively than sham acupuncture or gastrointestinal prokinetic agent. This article will report the protocol of the trial. METHODS: The current trial is a multicenter, randomized, three-arm controlled study undergoing in China. About 243 people who aged from 18 to 65 years with FC will be recruited in this study. These participants will be randomly allocated into three treatment groups, including electro-acupuncture (EA), Mosapride (M) and Mosapride & Sham Electro-acupuncture (MS) groups in a 1:1:1 ratio. Both the EA and sham EA receives 16 sessions of needling at Quchi (LI11) and Shangjuxu (ST37) during 4 weeks of treatment, and a follow-up period of 4 weeks. These groups will be compared on the primary outcomes of the number of times of defecation at baseline and 2, 4, 8 weeks after randomization. The secondary outcome measures include: stool consistency, intensity of defecating difficulty, MOS item Short Form health survey (SF-36), Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS), and the validated Patient Assessment of Constipation Quality of Life (PAC-QOL). These outcomes are measured at baseline and 2, 4 weeks after randomization, but SF-36 is measured at baseline and 4 weeks after randomization.

#2851,Efficacy and safety of electroacupuncture plus warm needling therapy for heel pain: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Heel pain is a common foot disorder that causes pain and functional limitations. The prevalence of disabling foot pain will increase as the population ages. Previous studies have reported the positive therapeutic effects of electroacupuncture, warm needling, or the combination of both for heel pain but with limitations in the study methodologies. The current study is a rigorously designed randomized controlled trial that aims to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of electroacupuncture plus warm needling therapy in patients with heel pain. METHODS/DESIGN: The study protocol describes a prospective, open-label, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial to be conducted in Hong Kong. Eighty patients aged 50-80 years who have reported heel pain and first-step pain equal to or exceeding 50 mm on the 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS) will be recruited. They will be randomly assigned (1:1 ratio) to the electroacupuncture plus warm needling therapy (i.e., treatment) group or the waitlist (i.e., control) group. The treatment group will undergo six treatment sessions in 4 weeks. The control group will receive no treatment during the study period. The primary outcome measure is a mean change in the first-step pain VAS score from the baseline to week 4. Secondary outcome measures include a mean change in first-step pain VAS score from the baseline to week 2, a mean change in Foot Function Index (FFI) subscale scores and the total score from the baseline to week 2 and week 4, and patients' self-reported level of improvement at week 4. Additional week 8 follow-up assessments with first-step pain VAS and FFI measurements will be arranged for the treatment group. Any adverse events will be recorded throughout the study to evaluate safety. An intention-to-treat approach will be used to analyze the study results. DISCUSSION: This study will provide evidence on the efficacy and safety of electroacupuncture plus warm needling therapy as an alternative treatment method for heel pain. The findings will determine whether the treatment protocol is efficacious in relieving pain and improving foot function among older adults with heel pain. The study will also provide information for subsequent large-scale randomized controlled trials in the future. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, ChiCTR1800014906 .

#2859,"Effects of the pestle needle therapy, a type of acupoint stimulation, on post-hemorrhoidectomy pain: A randomized controlled trial","BACKGROUND: Hemorrhoids are one of the most common conditions that lead to surgery, and until now surgical hemorrhoidectomy has been the major effective treatment. Post-operative pain from hemorrhoidectomy has been experienced by thousands of patients and remains a major inconvenience of the operation. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluates the clinical efficacy of the pestle needle therapy, an acupoint stimulation method, for relief of post-hemorrhoidectomy pain. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS AND INTERVENTIONS: This was a single-center, patient-assessor-blinded and randomized controlled trial with 154 patients receiving Milligan hemorrhoidectomy surgery. Eligible patients were randomly assigned to either a treatment group or a control group at a ratio of 1:1. The treatment group received the pestle needle therapy, with manual stimulation at Yaoshu (DU2), Mingmen (DU4), Changqiang (DU1), Chengshan (BL57), Erbai (EX-UE2) and the perianal points (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11o'clock around the lesion); while the control group received a sham treatment with very light pressure. Three sessions of treatment were performed at 30 min, 4 h and 12 h after the surgery, and each lasted for 15 min. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was post-operative pain measured with the visual analogue scale (VAS) at 12 h after surgery. The secondary outcomes included the VAS scores measured at 0.5, 2, 4, 6, 8, 24 and 48 h after surgery, the analgesic dose, the time and the VAS score of the patients' first defecation after surgery, as well as the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAMA) evaluated before discharge. RESULTS: The mean pain score of the treatment group was significantly lower than that of the control group (3.10 ± 1.27 vs 4.82 ± 1.29; P < 0.001) at 12 h after surgery. Compared with the control group, patients in the treatment group needed a smaller dose of analgesic within the first 24 hours after surgery (P = 0.002); and their HAMA scores before discharge were lower (4.07 ± 2.40 vs 5.10 ± 2.45, P = 0.009). Compared to the treatment group, patients in the control group had a greater time to the first defecation after surgery ([52.34 ± 15.72] h vs [27.08 ± 13.68] h; P < 0.001), but there was no difference in their VAS scores at the first defecation (P = 0.092). CONCLUSION: The pestle needle therapy was effective for relieving pain, reducing anxiety and improving bowel function after hemorrhoidectomy, and it is worthy of clinical application.",No,No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No
#2891,Acupuncture for HIV-associated distal symmetric peripheral neuropathy: A protocol for systematic review and meta-analysis,"BACKGROUND: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated distal symmetric peripheral neuropathy (DSPN) is one of the most frequent neurological complications of HIV infection, and causes pain and dysaesthesias in millions globally. Many individuals with this infection report using acupuncture to manage their symptoms, but evidence supporting the use of acupuncture is limited. This systematic review will assess the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture for patients with HIV-associated DSPN. METHODS: Databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Scopus, Web of science, AMED (Allied and Complementary Medicine), the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, the China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Database, VIP Database and clinical trials registers (the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform portal and www.ClinicalTrials.gov) will be electronically searched from inception to December 1, 2020. All randomized controlled trials in English or Chinese without restriction on publication status will be included.

#2902,Attenuation of blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats by acupuncture was associated with reduction oxidative stress and improvement from endothelial dysfunction,"BACKGROUND: Hypertension can be treated effectively by acupuncture; however, the association between acupuncture and endothelial function remains unknown. This study aimed to investigate the effects of acupuncture on endothelial dysfunction and oxidative stress-related parameters in spontaneously hypertensive animals. METHODS: Eighteen-week-old Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKYs) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) were arbitrarily divided into four groups: WKY control (n = 8), SHR control (n = 8), SHR sham-acupuncture (n = 8) and SHR acupuncture (n = 8). The SHR acupuncture group had electroacupuncture for 6 consecutive weeks on acupoints ST36 and LR3. Blood pressure was monitored during the treatment period, and animals were euthanized at the 6th week. Aortas were harvested for determination of angiotensin II levels, NADPH oxidase activity and nitrate/nitrite levels. The level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was determined by dihydroethidium (DHE) imaging, and functional studies were performed to assess vascular reactivity. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase was measured by Western blot assay. RESULTS: Blood pressure at the end of treatment was significantly lower in the SHR acupuncture group (185.0 ± 5.6 mmHg) compared with the SHR sham-acupuncture and the SHR control groups (201.0 ± 5.4 and 197.4 ± 5.9 mmHg, respectively; P < 0.001). Serum angiotensin II level in the SHR control group was significantly higher than in the WKY control group (P < 0.001), while it was significantly attenuated by acupuncture treatment (P = 0.023). DHE staining showed that ROS level was reduced in the aortas (P = 0.0017) and carotid arteries (P = 0.039) of acupuncture-treated SHRs. Biochemical assays showed that acupuncture inhibited the NADPH oxidase activity (P = 0.022) and enhanced antioxidant capacity (P = 0.0039). In functional studies, endothelium-dependent relaxation of aortic rings (P = 0.018) and carotid arteries (P = 0.022) in response to acetylcholine was improved in the SHR acupuncture group. Aortas of SHRs receiving acupuncture also expressed an elevated level of eNOS (P > 0.001) and p-eNOS (P = 0.012) and a reduced nitrotyrosine level (P = 0.0012). The nitrate/nitrite level in aortic tissue was also attenuated after acupuncture (P = 0.0018). CONCLUSION: The effects of acupuncture in treating hypertension were associated with reduced oxidative stress, increased nitric oxide bioavailability and endothelial function in SHRs.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No

#2934,Auricular acupuncture versus sham acupuncture in the treatment of women who have insomnia,"BACKGROUND: Improvement in sleep parameters in relation to acupuncture treatment is often found and referred to as being a positive side-effect in the treatment of other illnesses. There is a lack of randomized studies, which primarily study the direct effect of acupuncture on sleep. OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether or not auricular acupuncture has an effect on sleep parameters among people with insomnia. DESIGN: A single-blind, randomized pilot study where the treatment group received auricular acupuncture treatment (AAT) on active points and the control group received AAT on sham points during a 6-week treatment period. SETTING: Participants were recruited from the psychiatric outpatient clinics in the geographical area connected to a local hospital in central Sweden. SUBJECTS: In all, 28 women were included in the study, with 14 in each group. Their mean and median age was 53 years. OUTCOME MEASURES: Sleep parameters were obtained by using the Karolinska Sleep Diary. RESULTS: No statistically significant differences were observed between the groups relating to parameters associated with the definition of insomnia. The treatment group experienced that it was easier to wake up in the morning compared with the control group (repeated-measures analysis of variance, p = 0.04). Both groups showed a statistically significant recovery in subjective sleep parameters during the study period (weeks 1-6) compared with baseline values (week 0). CONCLUSIONS: Only modest evidence was found supporting the hypothesis that AAT may have an effect on insomnia. Least improvements were found in total sleep time and number of awakenings, 2 parameters directly associated with the definition of insomnia. AAT may have a role in the treatment of insomnia, especially in combination with other treatments such as cognitive behavioral therapy. This study provides an example of how to perform studies using alternative therapies for sleep disorders.",No,No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No
#2948,The benefit from whole body acupuncture in major depression,"BACKGROUND: In a single-blind placebo-controlled study design we investigated the efficacy of acupuncture additionally applied to drug treatment in major depression. METHODS: We randomly included 70 inpatients with a major depressive episode in three different treatment groups: verum acupuncture, placebo acupuncture and a control group. All three groups were pharmacologically treated with the antidepressant mianserin. The verum group received acupuncture at specific points considered effective in the treatment of depression. The placebo group was treated with acupuncture at non-specific locations and the control group received pharmacological treatment plus clinical management. Acupuncture was applied three times a week over a period of 4 weeks. Psychopathology was rated by judges blind to verum/placebo conditions twice a week over 8 weeks. RESULTS: Patients who experienced acupuncture improved slightly more than patients treated with mianserin alone. CONCLUSIONS: Additionally applied acupuncture improved the course of depression more than pharmacological treatment with mianserin alone. However, we could not detect any differences between placebo and verum acupuncture.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes
#2949,Determining the precise cerebral response to acupuncture: an improved FMRI study,"BACKGROUND: In acupuncture brain imaging trials, there are many non-acupuncture factors confounding the neuronal mapping. The modality of the placebo, subjects' psychological attitude to acupuncture and their physical state are the three most confounding factors. OBJECTIVE: To obtain more precise and accurate cerebral fMRI mapping of acupuncture. DESIGN AND SETTING: A 2×2 randomized, controlled, participant-blinded cross-over factorial acupuncture trial was conducted at Xuanwu Hospital in Beijing, China. PARTICIPANTS: Forty-one college students with myopia were recruited to participate in our study and were allocated randomly to four groups, Group A, Group B, Group C and Group D. INTERVENTIONS: Group A received real acupuncture (RA) and treatment instruction (TI); Group B received RA and non-treatment instruction (NI); Group C received sham acupuncture (SA) and TI; Group D received SA and NI. RESULTS: Stimulation at LR3 activated some areas of the visual cortex, and the cerebral response to non-acupuncture factors was complex and occurred in multiple areas. CONCLUSIONS: The results provide more evidence regarding the credibility of acupuncture therapy and suggest that more precise experimental designs are needed to eliminate sources of bias in acupuncture controlled trials and to obtain sound results.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#2967,Acupuncture in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis: a double-blind controlled pilot study,"BACKGROUND: In planning a randomized controlled trial of acupuncture, we conducted a pilot study using validated outcome measures to assess the feasibility of the protocol, and to obtain preliminary data on efficacy and tolerability of 3 different forms of acupuncture treatment as an adjunct for the treatment of chronic pain in patients with Rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: The study employs a randomized, prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the effect of electroacupuncture (EA), traditional Chinese acupuncture (TCA) and sham acupuncture (Sham) in patients with RA. All patients received 20 sessions over a period of 10 weeks. Six acupuncture points were chosen. Primary outcome is the changes in the pain score. Secondary outcomes included the changes in the ACR core disease measures, DAS 28 score and the number of patients who achieved ACR 20 at week 10. RESULTS: From 80 eligible patients, 36 patients with mean age of 58 +/- 10 years and disease duration of 9.3 +/- 6.4 years were recruited. Twelve patients were randomized to each group. Twelve, 10 and 7 patients from the EA, TCA and Sham group respectively completed the study at 20 weeks (p < 0.03); all except one of the premature dropouts were due to lack of efficacy. At week 10, the pain score remained unchanged in all 3 groups. The number of tender joints was significantly reduced for the EA and TCA groups. Physician's global score was significantly reduced for the EA group and patient's global score was significantly reduced for the TCA group. All the outcomes except patient's global score remained unchanged in the Sham group. CONCLUSION: This pilot study has allowed a number of recommendations to be made to facilitate the design of a large-scale trial, which in turn will help to clarify the existing evidence base on acupuncture for RA.

#2970,Placebo response varies between different types of sham acupuncture: A randomized double-blind trial in neck pain patients,"BACKGROUND: In prospective experimental studies of neck pain patients, it is difficult to determine whether responses to sham acupuncture differ from responses to real acupuncture due to the heterogeneous methodologies in control/sham interventions. Here we aim to compare the specific and nonspecific effects of electroacupuncture with four types of sham acupuncture. METHODS: In this double-blind, sham-controlled study, we randomly assigned 175 patients with neck pain to receive 10 sessions of electroacupuncture, shallow puncture, nonacupoint deep puncture, nonacupoint shallow puncture, or nonpenetration acupuncture. We used the Northwick Park Neck Pain Questionnaire (NPQ) as our primary outcome, and Short-form McGill Pain Questionnaire, visual analog scale (VAS), and Pain Threshold as secondary outcomes to measure the changes from baseline to a 3-month follow up. RESULTS: All groups, except nonacupoint shallow puncture, had significant improvement in all outcome measurements. Electroacupuncture only showed superior improvements than the shallow puncture, nonacupoint shallow puncture, and nonpenetration groups when compared using the NPQ and VAS scale (*p < 0.001). Interestingly, the nonacupoint shallow puncture produced even less placebo response than nonpenetration acupuncture. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates the high variability of placebo response among different types of sham controls depending on the depth of needle insertion and the puncture location. An important implication of our results is nonacupoint deep puncture produced similar analgesic effects as electroacupuncture. Our study may shed a new light on the predominant underlying mechanisms among different types of sham acupuncture controls, which can help with interpreting the effect of acupuncture in other studies. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Chinese clinical trial registry (ChiCTR-IOR-15006886). SIGNIFICANCE: This study compared the observed specific and nonspecific analgesia effect in four different types of sham acupuncture stimulation with neck pain patients, assessed by four outcomes. Although all of the sham controls produced significant reduction in neck pain, electroacupuncture had superior significant improvement. Importantly, placebo responses differed significantly between the sham controls and responses were inconsistent according to different outcome assessments. This study emphasizes the importance of taking into consideration which sham control and method of outcome measurement were used in a pain research study when evaluating its results.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes
#2974,Effects of acupuncture on age-related macular degeneration: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials,"BACKGROUND: In recent years, an increasing number of patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) have received acupuncture treatment, but there has been no systematic review to evaluate the effect of acupuncture on patients with AMD. PURPOSE: This meta-analysis aims to review the clinical efficacy of acupuncture in the treatment of AMD. METHODS: Randomized controlled trials up to September 4, 2022 were searched in the following databases: PubMed, Ovid Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, The Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure Database, VIP, Wanfang, and SINOMED. Two reviewers independently performed literature screening and data extraction. RevMan 5.4 was used for the meta-analysis. RESULTS: Nine of the 226 articles were finally included. A total of 508 AMD patients (631 eyes) were enrolled, including 360 dry eyes and 271 wet eyes. The results showed that acupuncture alone or as an adjunct therapy improved both the clinical efficacy and best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of AMD patients and reduced their central macular thickness. The certainty of the evidence ranged from ""low"" to ""very low"". CONCLUSION: There is no high-quality evidence that acupuncture is effective in treating patients with AMD; patients with dry AMD may benefit from acupuncture treatment. Considering the potential of acupuncture treatment for AMD, it is necessary to conduct a rigorously designed randomized controlled trials to verify its efficacy.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#2977,Effect of acupuncture combined with Ningshen mixture on climacteric insomnia: A randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: In recent years, the incidence of menopause insomnia has gradually increased, seriously affecting women's physical and mental health. METHODS: Total 82 climacteric insomnia patients received from January 2021 to January 2023 were divided into 2 groups at random. In control group, 41 cases received conventional Western medicine, and in study group, 41 cases received acupuncture combined with Ningshen mixture. Clinical effectiveness of both groups was compared, neurotransmitter levels, TCM syndrome integral and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) were assessed in both groups. Meanwhile, the recurrence rate and safety were evaluated in 2 groups. RESULTS: The curative effect in study group was better than that in control group (P < .05). After treatment, the expressions of 5-hydroxytryptamine and β-endorphin (β-EP) in study group were higher than control group (P < .05); TCM syndrome scores and PSQI scores in study group were lower than control group (P < .05). The total recurrence rate in study group was obviously lower than control group at 3 months after treatment (P < .05). There were no serious adverse reactions in both group, and no distinct difference between 2 groups was found (P > .05). CONCLUSION: Acupuncture united with Ningshen mixture has a significant therapeutic effect and high safety in climacteric insomnia patients. It can effectively improve the neurotransmitter levels, clinical symptoms and sleep quality, and reduce the recurrence rate of climacteric insomnia patients, which has high clinical application value and is worthy of clinical promotion.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes
#3000,Acupuncture for allergic rhinitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"BACKGROUND: In this study, we attempted to assess the efficacy and safety of acupuncture for allergic rhinitis (AR), and to test the robustness of the estimated effects. METHODS: The Cochrane methodology standard was followed to conduct this systematic review. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing acupuncture with other therapies for AR were included. Furthermore, trial sequential analysis was conducted to test the robustness of pooled results. Thirty trials with 4413 participants were included. RESULTS: Acupuncture improved the nasal symptoms on Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS) and quality of life measured by Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ) in adults with AR, compared to acupuncture with no intervention. Acupuncture was also shown to be more effective than sham acupuncture for nasal symptom (RQLQ subscale, n = 489, MD - 0.60, 95% CI - 1.16 to - 0.04) and quality of life (RQLQ, n = 248, - 8.47 95% CI - 14.91, - 2.03). No clear difference was observed between acupuncture and cetirizine or loratadine. Interestingly, trial sequential analysis (TSA) failed to confirm the aforementioned results. The effect of acupuncture for children/adolescents with AR remains unclear due to insufficient data. The performance bias and attrition bias are serious in most studies that were included. Selection bias may also have affected the quality of the evidence. CONCLUSION: Acupuncture may have an advantage over no intervention and sham acupuncture in improving nasal symptoms and quality of life for adults with AR. The effect of acupuncture and cetirizine or loratadine for AR may be similar. Additional trials are necessary to confirm these results.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#3001,Electroacupuncture upregulates ERK signaling pathways and promotes adult hippocampal neural progenitors proliferation in a rat model of depression,"BACKGROUND: In this study, we investigate the proliferation of adult neural stem cells (NSCs) in a chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) rat model of depression, the effects of electroacupunture (EA) on depressive-like symptoms and the corresponding signaling pathways. METHODS: SD rats were subjected to 4 weeks of CUS to induce depressive-like behaviors. EA was performed at the Du-20 (Bai-Hui) and GB-34 (Yang-Ling-Quan) acupoints. Rats were injected with BrdU and the brains were cut into sections. Double-labeling with BrdU/Sox2 and p-ERK/Nestin was performed to demonstrate the in vivo proliferation of adult NSCs in hippocampus and ERK activation in NSCs. Hippocampal microdialysates of different groups were collected to observe the in vitro effects on NSCs. RESULTS: After 8 treatments, EA generated a clear antidepressant effect on the stressed rats and promoted the NSC proliferation. ERK activation might be involved in the antidepressant-like effects of EA treatment. Hippocampal microdialysates from EA-treated stressed rats influenced NSCs to form larger neural spheres and exhibit higher p-ERK level in vitro, compared to the untreated stressed rats. Meanwhile, the antidepressant-like effects of EA involved contribution from both acupoint specificity and electrical stimulus. CONCLUSIONS: EA might interfere with the hippocampal microenvironment and enhance the activation of ERK signaling pathways. This could mediate, at least in part, the beneficial effects of EA on NSC proliferation and depressive-like behaviors.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#3011,Acupuncture for women undergoing in vitro fertilization: An updated systematic review and meta-analysis with trial sequential analysis,"BACKGROUND: In vitro fertilization (IVF) is a widely utilized assisted reproductive technology, but its success rates remain suboptimal due to various physiological and psychological factors. Acupuncture, as a complementary therapy, has been proposed to improve reproductive outcomes and alleviate associated pain and anxiety. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture as an adjunctive treatment for women undergoing IVF, focusing on reproductive outcomes, pain reduction, and anxiety alleviation. METHODS: Five English databases were searched up to June 20th, 2024. Manual acupuncture or electro-acupuncture was used solely as a complementary adjuvant in the experimental groups, and control interventions were sham acupuncture or blank (wait-list) control. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses were conducted based on the Cochrane systematic review method, and trial sequential analyses were performed. Meta-influence analyses, meta-regression and subgroup-analyses were performed for exploration of heterogeneity and related variables. Egger's together with trim and fill tests were conducted for evaluation of publication bias. The quality of the results was assessed, and correlation coefficient and cluster analyses were also performed. RESULTS: Finally, 42 trials identified from 37 published articles, involving 7400 participants, were included, representing diverse populations worldwide. Compared to sham acupuncture and blank controls, acupuncture significantly (P < 0.05) improved biochemical pregnancy rate (RR = 1.28, 95 % CI: 1.04-1.57) and clinical pregnancy rates (RR = 1.19, 95 % CI: 1.06-1.34). Additionally, acupuncture was associated with better pain management during surgery and reduced anxiety levels. Acupuncture-specific adverse events were reported in eight of 42 trials, primarily mild to moderate local reactions. However, a significantly higher early miscarriage rate was observed in the acupuncture groups (RR = 1.51, 95 % CI: 1.10-2.08). CONCLUSIONS: Acupuncture may improve certain reproductive outcomes and alleviate pain and anxiety in women undergoing IVF. However, the potential risk of early miscarriage warrants caution, and further rigorous trials are needed to confirm these findings.

#3015,The effect of treatment regimens on salivary cortisol levels in patients with chronic musculoskeletal disorders,"BACKGROUND: Increased levels of circulating cortisol have been associated with pain severity in patients with chronic musculoskeletal disorders (CMD). Little is known about the potential association between pain management and salivary cortisol alterations in CPM patients treated with different regimens. OBJECTIVES: This prospective feasibility study aimed to determine the effect of two treatment regimens in comparison with sham therapy on pain intensity and disability and salivary cortisol concentration (SCC) in patients with CMD. METHODS: Thirty patients were randomly assigned to 3 groups of 10: two experimental groups (A and B) and a control group (C). The experimental groups followed physiotherapy treatment (A) or acupuncture (B), while the control group (C) followed a sham therapy for 10 sessions. Pain data were collected using the Chronic Pain Grade (CPG) questionnaire and SCC was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay at pre- and posttreatment. RESULTS: Repeated-measures analysis of variance showed that patients treated with acupuncture experienced greater decreases in pain intensity/pain disability (P < 0.05) than the physiotherapy and sham therapy groups. No statistical differences were found between the three groups for the SCC outcome variable. Bonferroni adjustments showed that the mean values of SCC were significantly decreased at posttreatment (P < 0.05) across the three groups. CONCLUSION: There was a significant decrease in both pain and cortisol outcomes at posttreatment in patients with CMD. Because of the limitations of this study, we cannot draw conclusions regarding whether the lower SCC could be an indication of pain reduction in patients with CMD.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes
#3019,"Teaching an integrated approach to complementary, alternative, and mainstream therapies for children: a curriculum evaluation","BACKGROUND: Increasing numbers of patients seek information about complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) from their primary physicians. We sought to evaluate our 4-year old curriculum integrating mainstream and CAM care for common outpatient pediatric problems within a family medicine residency. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. METHODS: Subjects included current (1998) third-year residents and recent graduates from our program and nearby University of Washington-affiliated family medicine residency programs. The survey included items on training experiences, knowledge, attitudes and behavior regarding CAM. RESULTS: Among the 18 respondents from our program and 21 from comparison programs, the average age was 32 years and one-third were male. Over 80% of respondents felt that residencies should provide training in CAM. Substantial numbers of respondents from all programs recommended CAM therapies to patients in the past year. All respondents had recommended special diets and nutritional supplements; more than 50% recommended herbal remedies, acupuncture, meditation or progressive relaxation, massage or home remedies. Respondents from all groups had similar attitudes and knowledge about integrative medicine; those from the intervention program were more likely than comparison respondents to agree that their residency training had prepared them to answer patients' questions about CAM (50% vs. 19%, p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Primary care residents increasingly seek training to answer patients' questions and are already recommending a variety of CAM therapies.

The proposal of in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-ET) solves the problem of infertility to a certain extent. However, the average success rate of IVF-ET is still low. Some studies conclude that transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation (TEAS) could improve pregnancy outcomes in women undergoing IVF-ET, however, there is a lack of comprehensive synthesis and evaluation of existing evidence. OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess whether TEAS is effective and safe to improve the pregnancy outcomes for women undergoing IVF-ET. METHODS: Eight online databases were searched from inception to 19 November 2021. In addition, four clinical trial registries were also searched, relevant references were screened, and experts were consulted for possible eligible studies. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that included patients with infertility who underwent IVF and used TEAS as the main adjuvant treatment vs. non-TEAS or mock intervention controls were included. The clinical pregnancy rate (CPR) was considered the primary outcome. High-quality embryo rate (HQER), live birth rate (LBR), biochemical pregnancy rate (BPR), ongoing pregnancy rate (OPR), early miscarriage rate (EMR), birth defects rate (BDR), and adverse events related to interventions were regarded as secondary outcomes. The selection, data extraction, risk of bias assessment, and data synthesis were conducted by two independent researchers using Endnote software V.9.1 and Stata 16.0 software. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system was used to evaluate the evidence quality of each outcome. RESULTS: There were 19 RCTs involving 5,330 participants included. The results of meta-analyses showed that TEAS can improve CPR [RR = 1.42, 95% CI (1.31, 1.54)], HQER [RR = 1.09, 95% CI (1.05, 1.14)], and BPR [RR = 1.45, 95% CI (1.22, 1.71)] of women underwent IVF-ET with low quality of evidence, and improve LBR [RR = 1.42, 95% CI (1.19, 1.69)] with moderate quality of evidence. There was no significant difference in EMR [RR = 1.08, 95% CI (0.80, 1.45)] and BDR [RR = 0.93, 95% CI (0.13, 6.54)] with very low and moderate quality of evidence, respectively. A cumulative meta-analysis showed that the effective value of TEAS vs. controls was relatively stable in 2018 [RR = 1.52, 95% CI (1.35, 1.71)]. In addition, no serious adverse events associated with TEAS were reported. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that TEAS may be an effective and safe adjuvant treatment for women undergoing IVF-ET to improve pregnancy outcomes. However, the current evidence quality is considered to be limited, and more high-quality RCTs are needed for further verification in the future.

#3048,Clinical effects of glabellar botulinum toxin injections on borderline personality disorder: A randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Inhibition of frowning via injections of botulinum toxin A (BTX) into the glabellar region has shown beneficial effects in the treatment of major depression. Preliminary research suggests that improvements in the affective domain are not depression-specific, but may also translate to other psychiatric disorders. AIM: This 16-week, single-blind, two-center randomized controlled trial investigated the influence of BTX on clinical symptoms of borderline personality disorder (BPD). METHODS: Fifty-four patients with BPD were randomly assigned to treatment with BTX (n = 27) or a minimal acupuncture (ACU) control condition (n = 27). Clinical outcomes were followed at 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 16 weeks. Primary endpoint was the relative score change on the Zanarini Rating Scale for Borderline Personality Disorder (ZAN-BPD) 8 weeks after baseline relative to the control group and adjusted for treatment center. Secondary and additional outcome variables were self-rated borderline symptoms, comorbid symptoms of depression, psychological distress, and clinical global impression. RESULTS: Participants showed significant improvements at the primary efficacy endpoint in both treatment groups (BTX: M = -0.39, SD = 0.39; ACU: M = -0.35, SD = 0.42), but no superior effect of the BTX condition in comparison with the control intervention was found-F(1,5323) = 0.017, p = 0.68). None of the secondary or additional outcomes yielded significant group differences. Side effects were mild and included headache, transient skin or muscle irritations, and dizziness. CONCLUSION: Evidence regarding the efficacy of BTX for BDP remains limited, and the design of adequate control conditions presents an opportunity for further research.ClinicalTrials.gov registry: Botulinum Toxin A for Emotional Stabilization in Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), NCT02728778, https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02728778.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes

#3076,Efficacy of electroacupuncture for insomnia in cancer patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"BACKGROUND: Insomnia is a prevalent symptom among cancer patients. Electroacupuncture (EA) has been widely applied in managing sleep disorders, particularly in cancer patients or those experiencing insomnia. OBJECTIVES: This meta-analysis aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of electroacupuncture for treating cancer-related insomnia. METHODS: Two independent reviewers conducted comprehensive searches across multiple databases, including EMBASE, Web of Science, PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Wanfang Digital Journals, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and the VIP Database for Chinese Technical Periodicals. The search was completed on April 28, 2024. The reviewers independently performed literature screening, data extraction, and risk of bias (ROB) assessment using the revised Cochrane ROB tool. Data were analyzed using RevMan 5.4 and Stata 15.0 software. RESULTS: Eight randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving 550 patients (305 in the experimental group and 245 in the control group) were included. EA significantly reduced Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) scores (SMD = -0.86, 95% CI [-1.24, -0.49], p < 0.001), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) scores (SMD = -1.14, 95% CI [-1.59, -0.69], p < 0.001), sleep latency (SL) (SMD = -0.48, 95% CI [-0.73, -0.23], p < 0.001), and sleep disturbance (SDB) (SMD = -0.44, 95% CI [-0.73, -0.16], p = 0.002). EA also significantly lowered Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-Anxiety (HADS-Anxiety) scores (SMD = -0.59, 95% CI [-0.91, -0.26], p < 0.001) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-Depression (HADS-Depression) scores (SMD = -0.73, 95% CI [-1.06, -0.40], p < 0.001), while increasing total sleep time (TST) (SMD = 0.65, 95% CI [0.14, 1.17], p = 0.013). No significant differences were observed in the Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS), sleep duration (SD), sleep efficiency (SE), or sleep quality (SQ) scores between the EA and control groups. CONCLUSION: Electroacupuncture has shown promising potential in treating cancer-related insomnia by increasing total sleep time and reducing sleep disturbances.

#3091,Acupuncture for insomnia after stroke: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"BACKGROUND: Insomnia is the common complaint among patients with stroke. Acupuncture has increasingly been used for insomnia relief after stroke. The aim of the present study was to summarize and evaluate evidence on the effectiveness of acupuncture in relieving insomnia after stroke. METHODS: Seven databases were searched from inception through October 2014 without language restrictions. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included if acupuncture was compared to placebo or other conventional therapy for treatment of insomnia after stroke. Assessments were performed using the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI), the insomnia severity index (ISI), the Athens insomnia scale (AIS), and the efficacy standards of Chinese medicine. RESULTS: A total of 165 studies were identified; 13 RCTs met our inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis showed that acupuncture appeared to be more effective than drugs for treatment of insomnia after stroke, as assessed by the PSQI (weighted mean difference, 4.31; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 1.67-6.95; P = 0.001) and by the efficacy standards of Chinese medicine (risk ratio, 1.25; 95 % CI, 1.12-1.40; P < 0.001). Intradermal acupuncture had significant effects compared with sham acupuncture, as assessed by the ISI (weighted mean difference, 4.44; 95 % CI, 2.75-6.13; P < 0.001) and the AIS (weighted mean difference, 3.64; 95 % CI, 2.28-5.00; P < 0.001).

#3120,Electroacupuncture for patients with irritable bowel syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis protocol,"BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common functional intestinal disease characterized by chronic or recurrent abdominal pain, abdominal distension, constipation and diarrhea. Many IBS sufferers are usually present with poor quality of life for the abdominal discomfort, diarrhea, constipation, and other complaints. At present, the commonly used drug therapy for IBS in the Western clinic, such as antidiarrheal, laxative, gastrointestinal antispasmodic, often cannot get satisfying curative effect. Thus complementary therapies like electroacupuncture (EA) which may be effective to decrease patients' pain and fewer side-effects will be sought. EA, an innovative form of traditional acupuncture, is drawing more attention to the treatment of IBS due to its roles in symptom improvement. This systematic review protocol aims at describing a meta-analysis to critically evaluate the effectiveness and safety on EA for patients with IBS. METHODS: We search Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, PubMed, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Cochrane Library), the Allied and Complementary Medicine Databases (AMED), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) for random controlled trials EA for IBS from their inception to April 1, 2018. Two reviewers will independently screen studies for data extraction and assess the quality and risk of bias. RevManV5. 3 will be applied to data extraction. Risk of bias for each RCT will be assessed according to criteria by the Cochrane Handbook to evaluate the methodological quality. RESULTS: This study will provide a high-quality synthesis of current evidence of effectiveness and safety on EA for patients with IBS. CONCLUSION: The conclusion of our systematic review will provide evidence to judge whether EA is an effective intervention for patient with IBS.

#3176,"Efficacy and Safety of Acupuncture at Sensitized Acupoints for Knee Osteoarthritis: Protocol for a Multicenter, Single-Blind Randomized Controlled Trial","BACKGROUND: Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is a prevalent osteoarthritic disorder. Although acupuncture is increasingly used in clinical practice for KOA management, its efficacy remains to be further optimized. OBJECTIVE: This trial aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of acupuncture at sensitized acupoints for the treatment of KOA. METHODS: We will recruit 350 patients diagnosed with KOA from 3 clinical centers in this single-blind, sham-controlled, randomized controlled trial. Participants will be randomized to receive either acupuncture at 5 high-probability sensitized acupoints or sham acupuncture with nonpenetrative needling using Takakura acupuncture simulation devices. Both groups will receive 24 sessions over 8 weeks, followed by a 16-week posttreatment follow-up period. The primary outcome is the proportion of responders, defined as a reduction of 2 or more points in the Numeric Rating Scale score at week 8. Secondary outcomes include changes in scores on validated scales for KOA severity, walking distance, disability, depression, anxiety, insomnia, and pain self-efficacy. Adverse events will be documented for safety evaluation. RESULTS: The first participant was enrolled on February 15, 2025, and by June 28, 2025, we had enrolled 25 patients. Data analysis has not yet been initiated. The completion of data collection is anticipated by March 2026. CONCLUSIONS: This trial aims to provide confirmatory and exploratory evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of sensitized acupoint-based acupuncture for treating KOA. If the hypothesized benefits are substantiated, sensitized acupoint-based acupuncture could emerge as a complementary and alternative therapy for KOA, potentially reducing reliance on medication and mitigating drug-related adverse effects.

#3232,Active Ear Acupuncture Points in Neonates: Initial Results in a New Research Field,"Background: Little is known about active ear acupuncture points (EAP) in neonates. Previous unblinded studies by Stähler van Amerongen et al. showed that neonates have detectable active EAP, and that sick neonates could have more EAP relative to healthy neonates. EAP was investigated in an unblinded trial involving neonates with neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). Furthermore, a blinded, controlled observational trial was conducted to compare active EAP present in healthy neonates with EAP of sick neonates. Materials and Methods: An electrical point search device (PS3, Silberbauer, Vienna, Austria) was used to detect EAP. Active EAP were detected with an integrated optical and acoustical signal, and readings were transferred to a standardized ear map. A Mann-Whitney-U test and Spearman's correlation were used for statistical analysis. Results: A total of 94 neonates were enrolled across both trials. EAP were detectable in all healthy and sick neonates. In the blinded trial, sick neonates had a significantly higher number of active EAP than did healthy neonates. Conclusions: A notable difference in the number of active EAP was detected between healthy and sick neonates.

#3242,Evaluating acupuncture and standard care for pregnant women with back pain: the EASE Back pilot randomised controlled trial (ISRCTN49955124),"BACKGROUND: Low back pain (LBP) and pelvic girdle pain (PGP) during pregnancy are common and often accepted as a 'normal' part of pregnancy. Many women receive little in the way of treatment, and yet pain interferes with sleep, daily activities and work and leads to increasing requests for induction of labour or elective caesarean section. The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of a full RCT evaluating the benefit of acupuncture for pregnancy-related back pain. METHODS: This study is a single-centre, three-arm pilot RCT in one large maternity unit and associated antenatal and physiotherapy clinics. Women were eligible if they had pregnancy-related LBP with or without PGP. Exclusions included a history of miscarriage, high risk of early labour or pre-eclampsia, PGP only and previous acupuncture. Interventions were standard care (SC): a self-management booklet with physiotherapy if needed. SC+TA: the booklet and physiotherapy comprising true (penetrating) acupuncture, advice and exercise. SC+NPA: the booklet and physiotherapy comprising non-penetrating acupuncture, advice and exercise. Remote telephone randomisation used a 1:1:1 allocation ratio stratified by gestational weeks. Three measures of pain/function were compared to inform the primary outcome measure in a full RCT: the Pelvic Girdle Questionnaire (PGQ), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and 11-point 0-10 numerical rating scale for pain. Analysis focused on process evaluation of recruitment, retention, descriptive information on outcomes, adherence to treatment, occurrence of adverse events and impact of physiotherapist training. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-five women were randomised (45% of those eligible) between April and October 2013; 73% (n = 91) provided 8-week follow-up data. Three of six recruitment methods accounted for 82% of total uptake: screening questionnaire at the 20-week scan, community midwives issuing study cards, and self-referral following local awareness initiatives. Physiotherapists' self-confidence on managing pregnancy-related LBP improved post training. The PGQ is suitable as the primary outcome in a full trial. The average number of treatment sessions in both SC+TA and SC+NPA was six (in line with treatment protocols). No serious adverse events attributable to the trial treatments were reported. CONCLUSIONS: A full RCT is feasible and would provide evidence about the effectiveness of acupuncture and inform treatment choices for women with pregnancy-related LBP.

#3251,"Effects of electroacupuncture frequencies on chronic low back pain in older adults: triple-blind, 12-months protocol for a randomized controlled trial","BACKGROUND: Low back pain (LBP) is the most frequent complaint in clinical practice. Electroacupuncture treatment may be effective; however, the supporting evidence is still limited, especially in older adults. OBJECTIVE: The current study is a randomized controlled trial that aims to evaluate the clinical efficacy of electroacupuncture in older adults with LBP. METHODS: A five-arm randomized controlled trial with patients and evaluators blinded to the group allocation. A total of 125 participants with non-specific LBP will be randomly assigned into one of five groups: three electroacupuncture groups (low, high, and alternating frequency); one control group; and one placebo group. The electroacupuncture will be applied twice a week (30 min per session) for five weeks. The primary clinical outcome measure will be pain intensity. The secondary outcomes include: quality of pain; physical functioning; perceived overall effect; emotional functionality; patient satisfaction; and psychosocial factors. Patients will be evaluated before the first session, immediately after the last, and followed up after six and 12 months to check the medium- and long-term effects. DISCUSSION: Although electroacupuncture is increasingly used to treat LBP, there is no guidance regarding the parameters used, which leads to inconsistent results. Thus, the effect of electroacupuncture (EA) on LBP remains controversial and requires more studies, especially in the older adult population. CONCLUSION: This is the first randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of different frequencies of electroacupuncture for treating chronic LBP in older adults. This study will provide evidence on the effectiveness of electroacupuncture as an alternative treatment method for LBP and will entail wider debate about an appropriate acupuncture intervention in this population.

#3264,Meta-analysis: acupuncture for low back pain,"BACKGROUND: Low back pain limits activity and is the second most frequent reason for physician visits. Previous research shows widespread use of acupuncture for low back pain. PURPOSE: To assess acupuncture's effectiveness for treating low back pain. DATA SOURCES: Randomized, controlled trials were identified through searches of MEDLINE, Cochrane Central, EMBASE, AMED, CINAHL, CISCOM, and GERA databases through August 2004. Additional data sources included previous reviews and personal contacts with colleagues. STUDY SELECTION: Randomized, controlled trials comparing needle acupuncture with sham acupuncture, other sham treatments, no additional treatment, or another active treatment for patients with low back pain. DATA EXTRACTION: Data were dually extracted for the outcomes of pain, functional status, overall improvement, return to work, and analgesic consumption. In addition, study quality was assessed. DATA SYNTHESIS: The 33 randomized, controlled trials that met inclusion criteria were subgrouped according to acute or chronic pain, style of acupuncture, and type of control group used. The principal [correction] measure of effect size was the standardized mean difference, since the trials assessed the same outcome but measured it in various ways. For the primary outcome of short-term relief of chronic pain, the meta-analyses showed that acupuncture is significantly more effective than sham treatment (standardized mean difference, 0.54 [95% CI, 0.35 to 0.73]; 7 trials) and no additional treatment (standardized mean difference, 0.69 [CI, 0.40 to 0.98]; 8 trials). For patients with acute low back pain, data are sparse and inconclusive. Data are also insufficient for drawing conclusions about acupuncture's short-term effectiveness compared with most other therapies. LIMITATIONS: The quantity and quality of the included trials varied. CONCLUSIONS: Acupuncture effectively relieves chronic low back pain. No evidence suggests that acupuncture is more effective than other active therapies.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#3270,Massage for low-back pain,"BACKGROUND: Low-back pain is one of the most common and costly musculoskeletal problems in modern society. Proponents of massage therapy claim it can minimize pain and disability, and speed return to normal function. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of massage therapy for non-specific low-back pain. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL from their beginning to May 2008. We also searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2006, issue 3), HealthSTAR and Dissertation abstracts up to 2006. There were no language restrictions. References in the included studies and in reviews of the literature were screened. SELECTION CRITERIA: The studies had to be randomized or quasi-randomized trials investigating the use of any type of massage (using the hands or a mechanical device) as a treatment for non-specific low-back pain. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors selected the studies, assessed the risk of bias using the criteria recommended by the Cochrane Back Review Group, and extracted the data using standardized forms. Both qualitative and meta-analyses were performed. MAIN RESULTS: Thirteen randomized trials were included. Eight had a high risk and five had a low risk of bias. One study was published in German and the rest in English. Massage was compared to an inert therapy (sham treatment) in two studies that showed that massage was superior for pain and function on both short and long-term follow-ups. In eight studies, massage was compared to other active treatments. They showed that massage was similar to exercises, and massage was superior to joint mobilization, relaxation therapy, physical therapy, acupuncture and self-care education. One study showed that reflexology on the feet had no effect on pain and functioning. The beneficial effects of massage in patients with chronic low-back pain lasted at least one year after the end of the treatment. Two studies compared two different techniques of massage. One concluded that acupuncture massage produces better results than classic (Swedish) massage and another concluded that Thai massage produces similar results to classic (Swedish) massage. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Massage might be beneficial for patients with subacute and chronic non-specific low-back pain, especially when combined with exercises and education. The evidence suggests that acupuncture massage is more effective than classic massage, but this need confirmation.

While use of pharmacopuncture, a combined form of acupuncture and herbal medicine, for lumbar disc herniation is widespread in Korea and China, there is a paucity of research. METHODS/DESIGN: This study is the protocol for a three-armed, randomized, patient, physician, and assessor-blinded controlled pilot study. Sixty patients with severe non-acute sciatic pain diagnosed with lumbar disc herniation (NRS ≥ 5, onset between 4 weeks and 6 months) will be recruited and randomized 20 each to the Shinbaro pharmacopuncture (pharmacopuncture with acupuncture), acupuncture, and usual care groups, respectively. The 2 acupuncture groups will receive 2 sessions/week of acupuncture alone or with pharmacopuncture for 4 weeks (total 8 sessions), and the usual care group will receive conventional medication 2-3 times/day and physical therapy 2 sessions/week over 4 weeks (total 8 sessions). The initial acupuncture physician will administer acupuncture at 5 acupoints (GB30, BL40, BL25, BL23, GB34) in the 2 acupuncture groups, and mark an additional acupoint. A second acupuncture physician will administer pharmacopuncture to the marked acupoint in the pharmacopuncture group, and acupuncture in the acupuncture group during acupuncture needle retention. The second physician will administer acupuncture and pharmacopuncture in a similar manner in terms of advice and manual stimulation to maintain patient-blinding, treat the patient out of view of the initial physician, remove the additional acupuncture needle immediately, and cover the area with adhesive bandage to maintain physician-blinding. The primary endpoint will be at 5 weeks post-randomization, and the primary outcome will be Visual Analog Scale (VAS) of sciatic pain. Secondary outcomes will be VAS of low back pain, Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) of low back pain and sciatic pain, ODI, SF-36, EQ-5D, and PGIC. Post-treatment evaluations will take place 5, 7, 9, and 12 weeks after randomization. DISCUSSION: This trial will evaluate the comparative clinical effectiveness of pharmacopuncture for severe non-acute sciatic pain patients diagnosed with lumbar disc herniation with usual care of conventional medicine and that of Korean medicine (acupuncture), monitor its safety, and serve as basis for a large-scale, multicenter trial.

#3290,Acupuncture for lumbar myofascial pain Protocol for a systematic review of randomized controlled trials,"BACKGROUND: Lumbar myofascial pain is a major contributor to chronic low back pain. Acupuncture has been applied as an effective treatment for chronic low back pain worldwide. However, few critical systematic reviews focus on the effect of acupuncture on chronic low back pain caused by lumbar myofascial pain have been published. The study aims to evaluate the current evidence on the efficacy of acupuncture for chronic low back pain caused by lumbar myofascial pain. METHODS: A total of 7 databases will be searched from their inception to March 2019, including PubMed, Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure database, the Chinese Biomedical database, and the Wanfang database. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the effect of acupuncture for lumbar myofascial pain will be included. The primary outcomes will be reduction of lumbar myofascial pain assessed by Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Secondary outcomes are questionnaires to evaluate the effects of treatment on patients' daily life activities and psychological status; and adverse events. The primary and secondary outcomes will be assessed before (0 day) treatment and at 0, 7, 30, and 90 days after treatment. Data synthesis will be computed by RevManV.5.3.5 software when a data-analysis is allowed. Methodological quality will be evaluated with the risk of bias according to Cochrane Handbook. RESULTS: The results of this study will be published in a peer-reviewed journal. CONCLUSION: The study will provide evidence to illustrate acupuncture is an effective therapeutic intervention for chronic low back pain caused by lumbar myofascial pain.

#3296,Examining the efficacy of treatments for arm lymphedema in breast cancer survivors: an overview of systematic reviews with meta-analyses,"BACKGROUND: Lymphedema affects one in six breast cancer survivors making it a global healthcare challenge. There is considerable debate about the efficacy of different treatments for lymphedema. We aimed to summarize the current evidence for treatments for lymphedema in breast cancer survivors. METHODS: In this overview of systematic reviews with meta-analyses (SRMAs), five databases were searched for SRMAs of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) reporting effects of medications, surgery, exercise, laser therapy, acupuncture, kinesio taping, or complex decongestive physiotherapy (CDP) for breast cancer-related lymphedema published from database inception up to March 7, 2023. Data extraction was performed for the SRMAs and RCTs, and SRMAs were appraised with AMSTAR2. Random effects meta-analyses of the RCTs provided estimates of the pooled effects sizes (Hedges' g) for each treatment modality. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42020184813. FINDINGS: 1569 studies were identified by the search and eighteen SRMAs with 51 RCTs were included, investigating manual lymphatic drainage (MLD), compression pump, exercise, kinesio taping, laser, and acupuncture. Overall, the methodological quality of the SRMAs was low. SRMAs reached different conclusions for all treatment modalities, except for kinesio taping where the two SRMAs found no effect. The analysis of 40 RCTs with 1970 participants revealed a small effect across all interventions compared to any control (g = 0.20, p = 0.047, I(2) = 0.79), corresponding to volume reductions of 119.7 ml (95% CI 135-104) and 88.0 ml (95% CI 99-77) in the intervention and control groups, respectively, and a small effect of exercise (g = 0.26, p = 0.022, I(2) = 0.44). The between-group differences in volume reduction were small and did not reach statistical significance for any one treatment modality. INTERPRETATION: Based on the available data, there is no evidence of superiority of any one treatment on volume reduction nor any solid research refuting these treatments. Thus, definitive conclusions to inform clinical practice about the efficacy of these treatments cannot be drawn. Due to poor-quality evidence, more research is needed to untangle the efficacy of each treatment component for different stages of lymphedema.

#3310,Acupuncture in critically ill patients improves delayed gastric emptying: a randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Malnutrition remains a severe problem in the recovery of critically ill patients and leads to increased in-hospital morbidity and in-hospital stay. Even though early enteral nutrition has been shown to improve overall patient outcomes in the intensive care unit (ICU), tubefeed administration is often complicated by delayed gastric emptying and gastroesophageal reflux. Acupuncture has been successfully used in the treatment and prevention of perioperative nausea and vomiting. In this study we evaluated whether acupuncture can improve gastric emptying in comparison with standard promotility drugs in critically ill patients receiving enteral feeding. METHODS: Thirty mechanically ventilated neurosurgical ICU patients with delayed gastric emptying, defined as a gastric residual volume (GRV) >500 mL for ≥ 2 days, were prospectively and randomly assigned to either the acupoint stimulation group (ASG; bilateral transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation at Neiguan, PC-6) or the conventional promotility drug treatment group (DTG) over a period of 6 days (metoclopramide, cisapride, erythromycin). Patients in the ASG group did not receive any conventional promotility drugs. Successful treatment (feeding tolerance) was defined as GRV <200 mL per 24 hours. RESULTS: Demographic and hemodynamic data were similar in both groups. After 5 days of treatment, 80% of patients in the ASG group successfully developed feeding tolerance versus 60% in the DTG group. On treatment day 1, GRV decreased from 970 ± 87 mL to 346 ± 71 mL with acupoint stimulation (P = 0.003), whereas patients in the DTG group showed a significant increase in GRV from 903 ± 60 mL to 1040 ± 211 mL (P = 0.015). In addition, GRV decreased and feeding balance (defined as enteral feeding volume minus GRV) increased in more patients in the ASG group (14 of 15) than in the DTG group (7 of 15; P = 0.014). On treatment day 1, the mean feeding balance was significantly higher in the ASG group (121 ± 128 mL) than in the DTG group (-727 ± 259 mL) (P = 0.005). Overall, the feeding balance improved significantly on all days of treatment in comparison with the DTG group. Patients in the DTG group did not show an increase in feeding balance until day 6. CONCLUSIONS: We introduce a new protocol for acupuncture administration in the critical care setting. We demonstrated that this protocol was more effective than standard promotility medication in the treatment of delayed gastric emptying in critically ill patients. Acupoint stimulation at Neiguan (PC-6) may be a convenient and inexpensive option (with few side effects) for the prevention and treatment of malnutrition in critically ill patients.",Yes,No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No
#3344,Evaluating Acupuncture and Standard carE for pregnant women with Back pain (EASE Back): a feasibility study and pilot randomised trial,"BACKGROUND: Many pregnant women experience low back pain. Acupuncture appears to be a safe, promising intervention but evidence is needed about its clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. OBJECTIVES: To assess the feasibility of a future large randomised controlled trial (RCT) testing the additional benefit of adding acupuncture to standard care (SC) for pregnancy-related back pain. DESIGN: Phase 1: a questionnaire survey described current care for pregnancy-related back pain. Focus groups and interviews with midwives, physiotherapists and pregnant women explored acceptability and feasibility of acupuncture and the proposed RCT. Phase 2: a single-centre pilot RCT. Participants were identified using six methods and randomised to SC, SC plus true acupuncture or SC plus non-penetrating acupuncture. PARTICIPANTS: Phase 1: 1093 physiotherapists were surveyed and 15 midwives, 21 physiotherapists and 17 pregnant women participated in five focus groups and 20 individual interviews. Phase 2: 125 women with pregnancy-related back pain participated. INTERVENTIONS: SC: a self-management booklet and onward referral for one-to-one physiotherapy (two to four sessions) for those who needed it. SC plus true acupuncture: the self-management booklet and six to eight treatments with a physiotherapist comprising true (penetrating) acupuncture, advice and exercise. SC plus non-penetrating acupuncture: the self-management booklet and six to eight treatments with a physiotherapist comprising non-penetrating acupuncture, advice and exercise. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Pilot RCT outcomes included recruitment rates, treatment fidelity, follow-up rate, patient-reported pain and function, quality of life and health-care resource use. Birth and neonatal outcomes were also assessed. Staff overseeing outcome data collection were blind to treatment allocation. RESULTS: Phase 1: 629 (57.5%) physiotherapists responded to the survey, 499 were experienced in treating pregnancy-related back pain and reported 16 advice and 18 treatment options. Typical treatment comprised two to four individual sessions of advice and exercise over 6 weeks. Acupuncture was reported by 24%. Interviews highlighted the impact of back pain and paucity of effective interventions. Women and midwives strongly supported a RCT and expressed few concerns. Physiotherapists' concerns about acupuncture in pregnancy informed a training programme prior to the pilot RCT. Phase 2: We recruited 125 of 280 potentially eligible women (45%) in 6 months and randomised 41 to SC and 42 each to the SC plus true acupuncture and SC plus non-penetrating acupuncture arms. Analysis was conducted with 124 participants (41, 42 and 41, respectively) as one participant was randomised in error. Three of six recruitment methods were the most successful. In total, 10% of women (n = 4) randomised to SC alone accessed one-to-one physiotherapy and received an average of two treatments. The average number of treatments was six for both SC plus true acupuncture and SC plus non-penetrating acupuncture. Treatments were in line with protocols. Eight-week follow-up was 74%. Patient-reported outcomes (pain, function and quality of life) favoured the addition of acupuncture. There was no evidence of serious adverse events on mothers or birth and neonatal outcomes. The Pelvic Girdle Questionnaire was found to be an appropriate outcome measure for a future trial. CONCLUSIONS: A future main RCT is feasible and would be welcomed by women and clinicians. Longer-term follow-up and further follow-up efforts are recommended for a main trial. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN49955124.

#3346,The Efficacy of Acupuncture on Anthropometric Measures and the Biochemical Markers for Metabolic Syndrome: A Randomized Controlled Pilot Study,"BACKGROUND: Many previous studies have shown the potential therapeutic effect of acupuncture for metabolic syndrome (MetS). However, most of these studies were limited by short durations of observation and a lack of sham acupuncture as control. We designed a randomized controlled trial, used sham acupuncture as the control, and evaluated the efficacy over 12 weeks of treatment and 12 weeks of follow-up. METHODS/DESIGN: The study was designed as a multicentre, parallel-group, randomized, double-blinded trial. 40 patients were randomly assigned to two groups: treatment group (treated with acupuncture) and control group (treated with sham acupuncture). Outcomes were measured at 4, 8, and 12 weeks and 3 months after treatment. RESULTS: 33 participants (17 in acupuncture group and 16 in control group) completed the treatment and the follow-up. Decreases from baseline in mean waist circumference (WC) and weight at the end of treatment were 4.85 cm (95% CI [2.405,5.595]) and 4.00 kg (95% CI [1.6208,4.4498]) in acupuncture group and 1.62 cm and 1.64 kg in control group (P < 0.01). The changes in mean glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c), triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), and blood pressure in acupuncture group were greater than the changes in control group (P < 0.05, P < 0.01).

#3349,An Overview of Systematic Reviews and Meta- analyses on Acupuncture for Post-acute Stroke Dysphagia,"BACKGROUND: Many randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews (SRs) on acupuncture treatment for post-acute stroke dysphagia have been published. Conflicting results from different SRs necessitated an overview to summarize and assess the quality of this evidence to determine whether acupuncture is effective for this condition. The aim was to evaluate methodological quality and summarizing the evidence for important outcomes. METHODS: Seven databases were searched for SRs and/or meta-analysis of RCTs and quasi-RCTs on acupuncture for post-acute stroke dysphagia. Two authors independently identified SRs and meta-analyses, collected data to assess the quality of included SRs and meta analyses according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) and the revised Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR 2). RESULTS: Searches yielded 382 SRs, 31 were included. The quality of 22 SRs was critically low, five SRs were low, and four Cochrane SRs were moderate when evaluated by AMSTAR2. A total of 17 SRs reported 85.2-96.3% of PRISMA items. Five SRs included explanatory RCTs, 16 SRs included pragmatic RCTs, and 10 SRs included both. CONCLUSION: Currently, evidence on the effectiveness of acupuncture on post-acute stroke dysphagia is of a low quality. The type of study appeared to have no direct influence on the result, but the primary outcome measures showed a relationship with the quality of SRs. High quality trials with large sample sizes should be the focus of future research.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#3367,"Acupuncture for pain, mandibular function and oral health-related quality of life in patients with masticatory myofascial pain: A randomised controlled trial","BACKGROUND: Masticatory myofascial pain is the most prevalent muscular temporomandibular disorders (TMD). It primarily affects masseter and temporal muscles. Several treatments, including acupuncture, have been recommended. However, systematic reviews have highlighted gaps in studies and absence of conclusive results. OBJECTIVES: We performed a randomised controlled clinical trial to evaluate the effectiveness of acupuncture in improving pain, mandibular function and oral health-related quality of life in women with masticatory myofascial pain. METHODS: Thirty-six patients diagnosed with masticatory myofascial pain according to the Research Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders (RDC/TMD) were divided into the following two groups: acupuncture and control (non-penetrating acupuncture).Treatment was performed weekly for 5 weeks, and pain, mandibular function and oral health-related quality of life were evaluated one week before treatment, one week after treatment and one month after treatment. Non-parametric and parametric tests were used for comparisons between times and treatment groups (significance level of P ≤ .05). RESULTS: The acupuncture group showed a significant reduction in pain (P ≤ .01), which was not observed in the control group. Pain intensity was reduced by 61% and 84% at 1 week and 1 month after treatment, respectively. Both groups showed significant improvements in mandibular function and oral health-related quality of life over time (P ≤ .01). Statistical analysis did not show a significant difference between the groups for any other evaluated outcome (P > .05). CONCLUSION: Although acupuncture was effective in pain reduction, non-specific factors may have influenced mandibular function and oral health-related quality of life improvements in both groups, and this needs to be further addressed.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes
#3379,Effect of acupuncture on menopausal depressive disorder and serum hormone levels: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"BACKGROUND: Menopause, marked by ovarian decline and hormonal shifts, increases vulnerability to depressive disorders, with menopausal depressive disorder (MDD) affecting 33-36% of women via psychosocial-biological interactions. Acupuncture shows promise in improving MDD through neuroendocrine regulation but lacks robust evidence, with unclear links to reproductive hormone modulation; this study evaluates its efficacy and safety. METHODS: A comprehensive database search was conducted using PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, EBSCO, Scopus, Cnki, Wan Fang and VIP Database to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the impact of acupuncture on menopausal depressive disorder. RCTs published until April 21, 2025, that met our predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria were included. Data extraction, literature review, and assessment of the methodological quality of the trials were performed. The meta-analysis was conducted using Review Manager (RevMan) 5.3 software. RESULTS: Our findings demonstrate that acupuncture significantly outperforms control interventions in improving clinical effectiveness rates (OR=2.70, 95%CI[1.63,4.48], P=0.0001) and reducing depressive symptoms, as evidenced by HAMD-17 (SMD=-0.28, P<0.0001) and HAMD-24 scores (post-sensitivity SMD=-0.39, P=0.03). Notably, acupuncture also enhanced quality of life (MENQOL: SMD=-0.25, P=0.003), though its effects on sex hormones (FSH, LH, E2) remained nonsignificant (P>0.05). Safety profiles were comparable between groups (OR=0.16, P=0.05), yet sensitivity analysis revealed reduced adverse events in the acupuncture group after excluding outlier studies (OR=0.49, P=0.03). In conclusion, the intervention of acupuncture is beneficial for MDD. CONCLUSION: This systematic review demonstrates that acupuncture serves as an effective and safe non-pharmacological intervention for alleviating menopausal depressive symptoms and improving quality of life. While acupuncture did not significantly modulate sex hormone levels, its therapeutic benefits are likely mediated through non-hormonal mechanisms, such as neurotransmitter regulation and neuroendocrine network modulation.

#3385,Effects of Meridian Massage on physical growth and infants' health as perceived by mothers,"BACKGROUND: Meridian Massage is a traditional practice that manually stimulates the body's meridian system - the same network of vital energy channels used in acupuncture. The present study was to assess the effect of Meridian Massage on physical growth and infants' health as perceived by mothers. METHODS: A study was conducted in a community health center in Korea. A total of 169 healthy infant-mother dyads were assigned to the Meridian Massage group (n= 89) or the gentle touch massage group (n= 80), based on the mother's preference. All massages were conducted by the mothers for 15 min per session, one time daily over a course of 6 weeks. In each group, the infant's weights, heights, and the number of days with illness as perceived by mothers and related clinic visits were measured. RESULTS: Significant differences were observed in weight and height after 6 weeks between the Meridian group and the gentle touch massage group (P < 0.001). Infants in the Meridian Massage group showed a significantly different number of days with perceived clinic visits compared to those in the control group (P < 0.001).

#3406,Acupuncture versus Various Control Treatments in the Treatment of Migraine: A Review of Randomized Controlled Trials from the Past 10 Years,"BACKGROUND: Migraine is defined as a recurrent headache of moderate to severe intensity that seriously affects the quality of life. Recent clinical trials have confirmed that acupuncture is effective in treating migraine. We aimed to review the effectiveness of acupuncture in the treatment of migraine by comparing treatment and various control groups in accordance with the newly published guidelines for systematic reviews. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The following databases were searched for relevant articles published from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2019: Embase, PubMed, Medline, Cochrane Library, and four Chinese databases. The present review included randomized controlled trials in which acupuncture was the sole treatment or an adjunctive treatment for migraine. Two researchers independently conducted the study selection, data extraction, and quality assessment processes. Disagreements between reviewers were solved by discussion and data reanalysis. The quality of each included study was evaluated using the Cochrane Collaboration risk-of-bias assessment method and the Standards for Reporting Interventions in Controlled Trials of Acupuncture (STRICTA) checklist. RESULTS: Forty-nine studies were analyzed and ranked based on the latest STRICTA and Cochrane Collaboration risk-of-bias assessment standards. The analysis revealed that acupuncture reduced headache frequency compared with no treatment (mean difference [MD] = -1.80, P < 0.00001, 95% confidence interval [CI] -2.34 to -1.26) and western medicine (MD = -1.75, P = 0.003, 95% CI -2.91 to -0.58). Headache frequency did not significantly differ between patients who received real acupuncture versus those who received sham acupuncture (MD = -0.64, P = 0.24, 95% CI -1.70 to 0.42). CONCLUSION: The present review evaluated the current research on the use of acupuncture for migraine, compared with various control treatments. The evidence for the effectiveness of acupuncture in controlling migraine is still limited due to the low quality of the published studies.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#3417,Factors contributing to cognitive improvement effects of acupuncture in patients with mild cognitive impairment: a pilot randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is generally regarded as the borderline between cognitive changes of aging and very early Alzheimer's disease (AD). It is important to develop easily available interventions to delay the progression of MCI to AD. We investigated factors contributing to the cognitive improvement effects of acupuncture to obtain data for developing optimized acupuncture treatments for MCI. METHODS: This outcome assessor-blinded, randomized controlled trial included a full analysis for comparing the efficacy of different acupuncture methods. Thirty-two participants with MCI (i.e., fulfilling the Peterson diagnostic criteria for MCI, K-MMSE scores of 20-23, and MoCA-K scale scores of 0-22) were randomly assigned to basic acupuncture (BA; GV20, EX-HN1, GB20, and GV24 for 30 min), acupoint specificity (AS; adding KI3 to BA), needle duration (ND; BA for 20 min), or electroacupuncture (EA; electrical stimulation to BA) groups (n=8/group) via 1:1:1:1 allocation and administered acupuncture once daily, three times a week for 8 weeks. The measured outcomes included scores on the Korean version of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-K-cog), Korean version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment scale (MoCA-K), Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale, Korean Activities of Daily Living scale, Korean Instrumental Activities of Daily Living scale, and European Quality of Life Five Dimension Five Level Scale. Outcome measurements were recorded at baseline (week 0), intervention endpoint (week 8), and 12 weeks after intervention completion (week 20). RESULTS: Twenty-five patients with MCI completed the trial (BA group, 8; AS group, 6; ND group, 5; EA group, 6). MoCA-K scores were significantly increased in the BA group compared with the ND (p=0.008, week 8-week 0) and EA groups (p=0.003, week 8-week 0; p=0.043, week 20-week 0). ADAS-K-cog scores were significantly decreased in the BA group compared with the ND group (p=0.019, week 20-week 0). CONCLUSIONS: The BA group showed significant improvement in cognitive function compared to the ND and EA groups. Electrical stimulation and needle duration may contribute to the cognitive improvement effects of acupuncture in patients with MCI.

#3428,Minimally invasive non-surgical management of plantar fasciitis: A systematic review,"BACKGROUND: Minimally invasive non-surgical techniques have been widely used worldwide to treat musculoskeletal injuries. Of these techniques, injectable pharmaceutical agents are the most commonly employed treatments, with corticosteroids being the most widely used drugs. The aim of this article is to review current scientific evidence as well as the effectiveness of minimally invasive non-surgical techniques, either alone or combined, for the treatment of plantar fasciitis. METHODS: This systematic review was conducted from April 2016 until March 2017, in accordance with the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement and was registered with PROSPERO. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of adult patients diagnosed with plantar fasciitis were included as well as intervention studies, with a minimal sample size of 20 subjects per study (10 per group). Assessment of study eligibility was developed by three reviewers independently in an unblinded standardized manner. The physiotherapy evidence database (PEDro) scale was used to analyse the methodological quality of studies. RESULTS: Twenty-nine full-text articles on minimally invasive techniques were reviewed. These articles focused on corticosteroid injections, platelet-rich plasma, Botox, dextrose injections, as well as comparative studies with dry needling vs sham needling. CONCLUSION: The treatment of plantar fasciitis has dramatically improved in the past decade with minimally invasive techniques becoming increasingly available. Research findings have shown that the long term effects of minimally invasive (non-surgical) treatments such as shock wave therapy, botulinum toxin type-A injections, platelet-rich plasma injections and intratissue percutaneous electrolysis dry needling show similar and sometimes better results when compared to only corticosteroid injections. The latter have been the mainstay of treatment for many years despite their associated side effects both locally and systemically. To date, there is no definitive treatment guideline for plantar fasciitis, however the findings of this literature review may help inform practitioners and clinicians who use invasive methods for the treatment of plantar fasciitis regarding the levels of evidence for the different treatment modalities available.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#3435,Acupuncture facilitates neuromuscular and oculomotor responses to skin incision with no influence on auditory evoked potentials under sevoflurane anaesthesia,"BACKGROUND: More sevoflurane was recently found to be required to prevent movement in response to surgical incision in anaesthetized patients subjected to electro-acupuncture (EA) than to sham procedures. The present study was designed to compare differences in movement, dilatation of the pupils, divergence of the eye axes and activity of auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) between patients given and those not given EA under standardized sevoflurane anaesthesia. METHODS: Neuromuscular, oculomotor and AEP responses to skin incision were assessed with and without a bilateral 2-Hz burst EA in patients under steady-state anaesthesia maintained with 1.8% of sevoflurane. Forty-five healthy patients, scheduled for laparoscopic sterilization, were randomized for EA (n = 22) or sham (n = 23) procedures between induction of anaesthesia and start of surgery. Middle latency AEP activity was recorded and interpreted by the A-line ARX (autoregression with exogenous input) index (AAI). RESULTS: More acupuncture than sham patients were found to respond to skin incision with movement of the neck or limbs (77% vs. 43%; P = 0.021), dilatation of the pupils (77% vs. 39%; P = 0.001) and divergence of the eye axes (72% vs. 39%; P = 0.023), whereas there was no difference in AAI response. CONCLUSION: Electro-acupuncture facilitates physiological responses to nociceptive stimulation under sevoflurane anaesthesia. Differences in neuromuscular and oculomotor responses between acupuncture and sham patients under general anaesthesia are probably not associated with interaction between EA and the depth of anaesthesia, as AEP activity was similar in the two groups.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes
#3449,"Efficacy of Tasimelteon (HETLIOZ®) in the Treatment of Jet Lag Disorder Evaluated in an 8-h Phase Advance Model; a Multicenter, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial","Background: Most travelers experience Jet Lag Disorder (JLD) symptoms due to misalignment of their circadian rhythms with respect to the new time zone. We assessed the efficacy and safety of tasimelteon (HETLIOZ®) in healthy participants using a laboratory model of JLD induced by an 8-h phase advance of the sleep-wake cycle (JET8 Study). We hypothesized that tasimelteon treatment in participants experiencing JLD would cause increased sleep time, increased next-day alertness, and reduced next-day sleepiness. Methods: We undertook a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 12 US clinical research sleep centers. We screened healthy adults ages 18-73 years, who were eligible for the randomization phase of JET8 if they typically went to bed between 21:00 and 01:00, slept between 7 and 9 h each night, and slept at a consistent bedtime. We used block randomization stratified by site to assign participants (1:1) to receive a single oral dose of tasimelteon (20 mg) or placebo 30 min before their 8-h phase-advanced bedtime. The primary endpoint was Total Sleep Time in the first 2/3 of the night (TST(2/3)), which was measured by polysomnography during the 8-h sleep episode, and assessed in the intent-to-treat population. The trial is completed and registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03373201. Results: Between October 16, 2017 and January 17, 2018, we screened 607 healthy participants for JET8, of whom 320 (53%) were assigned to receive tasimelteon (n = 160) or placebo (n = 160). Tasimelteon treatment increased TST(2/3) (primary endpoint) by 60.3 min (95%CI 44.0 to 76.7, P < 0.0001) and whole night TST by 85.5 min (95% CI 64.3 to 106.6, P < 0.0001), improved next day alertness, next day sleepiness, and shortened latency to persistent sleep by -15.1 min (95% CI -26.2 to -4.0, P = 0.0081). Conclusion: A single dose of tasimelteon improves the primary symptoms of JLD, including nighttime insomnia and next day functioning among participants in a laboratory model of JLD simulating eastward trans-meridian travel by inducing an 8-h phase advance of the sleep-wake cycle.",No,No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No
#3451,The efficacy and safety of acupuncture combined with language training for motor aphasia after stroke: study protocol for a multicenter randomized sham-controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Motor aphasia after stroke is a common and intractable complication of stroke. Acupuncture and language training may be an alternative and effective approach. However, the efficacy of acupuncture and language training for motor aphasia after stroke has not been confirmed. The main objectives of this trial are to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture and low-intensity, low-dose language training in treating ischemic motor aphasia after stroke from 15 to 90 days. METHODS: This is a multicenter randomized sham-controlled clinical trial. We will allocate 252 subjects aged between 45 and 75 years diagnosed with motor aphasia after stroke with an onset time ranging from 15 to 90 days into two groups randomly in a 1:1 ratio. Patients in the experimental group will be treated with ""Xing-Nao Kai-Qiao"" acupuncture therapy plus language training, and those in the control group will be treated with sham-acupoint (1 cun next to the acupoints) acupuncture therapy plus language training. All the patients will be given acupuncture and language training for 6 weeks, with a follow-up evaluation 6 weeks after the end of the treatment and 6 months after the onset time. The patients will mainly be evaluated using the Western Aphasia Battery and Chinese Functional Communication Profile, and the incidence of treatment-related adverse events at the 2nd, 4th, and 6th weeks of treatment will be recorded. The baseline characteristics of the patients will be summarized by group, the chi-squared test will be used to compare categorical variables, and repeated measures of analysis of variance or a linear mixed model will be applied to analyze the changes measured at different time points. DISCUSSION: The present study is designed to investigate the effectiveness and safety of traditional acupuncture therapy and language training in ischemic motor aphasia after stroke and explore the correlation between the treatment time and clinical effect of acupuncture. We hope our results will help doctors understand and utilize acupuncture combined with language training. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ChiCTR ChiCTR1900026740 .

#3454,Clinical observation of acupuncture combined with modern rehabilitation in the treatment of limb motor dysfunction after ischemic stroke: A randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Motor dysfunction is a common sequela of ischemic stroke. This study aimed to explore the effective treatment of ischemic stroke by combining acupuncture and modern rehabilitation training. METHODS: This study was a single-center, randomized controlled clinical trial conducted at the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, 90 cases were finally included, divided into 45 cases each in the body acupuncture group and the head acupuncture group. INTERVENTIONS: Both groups received basic drug treatment, modern rehabilitation training, and basic life care guidance; the body acupuncture group was treated with reference to acupuncture points from the classic textbook of acupuncture and moxibustion, and the head acupuncture group was given Zhu's scalp acupuncture treatment based on the body acupuncture group. Primary outcome index: unassisted muscle strength grading scale; secondary outcome index: assessment of activities of daily living; simplified Fugl-Meyer motor function rating scale. RESULTS: The Barthel scale score, Manual Muscle Testing scale score (upper and lower limbs), and simplified Fugl-Meyer scale score (upper and lower limbs) in the 2 groups were improved (P ≤ .05), and the efficacy of the head-acupuncture group was better than that of the body-acupuncture group (P ≤ .05); there was no significant improvement in the simplified Fugl-Meyer scale (hand) score in both groups (P ≥ .05). There was no significant improvement in these scores (P ≥ .05). The difference in efficiency between the 2 groups was not statistically significant (P ≤ .05), and the apparent efficiency in the cephalic needle group was higher than that in the body needle group (P ≤ .05). CONCLUSIONS: Simultaneous treatment with Zhu's scalp acupuncture and body acupuncture combined with modern rehabilitation training can significantly improve limb motor function in patients with ischemic stroke, and its efficacy is better than that of body acupuncture alone combined with modern rehabilitation training.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes
#3471,Effect of moxibustion on the expression of GDNF and its receptor GFRα3 in the colon and spinal cord of rats with irritable bowel syndrome,"BACKGROUND: Moxibustion treatment has been found to ameliorate clinical symptoms including abdominal pain, diarrhoea and constipation in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Herein we investigated the mechanisms underlying the use of moxibustion in a rat model of IBS. METHODS: In our study, an IBS model was established in rats by colorectal distension (CRD) stimulus and mustard oil enema. The rats were randomly divided into a normal group, model group, mild moxibustion group, electroacupuncture group, probiotic group and dicetel group. Abdominal withdrawal reflex (AWR) scores were determined within 90 min of the last treatment. The expression of GDNF/GFRα3 protein and mRNA in the colon and spinal cord were detected by immunohistochemistry and quantitative real-time-PCR, respectively. RESULTS: The IBS model rats had significantly higher AWR scores than the normal group (P<0.01). After mild moxibustion treatment, the AWR score was significantly reduced (20 mm Hg, P<0.05; 40 mm Hg, 60 mm Hg and 80 mm Hg, P<0.01). The model group showed significantly more colonic glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF/GFRα3 (GDNF family receptor α3) protein and mRNA expression in the colon and spinal cord than the normal group (P<0.01). Compared with the model group, the expression of GDNF/GFRα3 protein and mRNA in the colon and spinal cord of the rats were significantly decreased in the mild moxibustion group (colon: GDNF and GFRα3 protein, P<0.01; GDNF and GFRα3 mRNA, P<0.01; spinal cord: GDNF and GFRα3 protein, P<0.01; GDNF mRNA, P<0.05, GFRα3 mRNA, P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that moxibustion therapy may mitigate CRD-induced increases in the expression of GDNF and its receptor GFRα3 in the colon and spinal cord in a rat model of IBS.",Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#3472,Quality of moxa wool contained in commercial moxibustion devices: test method and examples of waste particle concentration,"BACKGROUND: Moxibustion treatment involves a combination of thermal and chemical stimulation applied by the combustion of moxa wool. The quality of moxa wool is considered to be an important factor in moxibustion treatment traditionally and clinically. However, despite its importance, quantitative and objective methods for determining moxa wool quality are lacking. METHODS: Moxa wool and commercial indirect moxibustion (CIM) device specimens were randomly collected, dried and strained through sieves of various sizes for 10 h. After sieving, the residues remaining on each sieve were collected. The collected samples were weighed and microscopically observed. RESULTS: In this study, we observed that fibres mainly remained on sieves sized 425 μm, and particles were smaller than 300 μm. The residues between 425 and 300 μm varied between the products. In addition, moxa wool for direct moxibustion (DMW) exhibited significantly more fibres than moxa wool for indirect moxibustion (IMW). Most of the CIM devices using moxa wool had a quality similar to IMW, except for one CIM brand using moxa wool that contained three times more waste particles than IMW. CONCLUSION: Based on the results of this study, we conclude that the sieving method is useful for testing the quality of moxa wool even after the CIM manufacturing process. The sieve sizes of 425 and 300 μm could be used as a yardstick to determine the quality of moxa wool. Although this approach requires larger scale validation against existing standard methodologies, we believe it has great potential to be used to improve and safeguard the quality of moxa wool contained in commercial moxibustion devices.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#3475,Moxibustion and other acupuncture point stimulation methods to treat breech presentation: a systematic review of clinical trials,"BACKGROUND: Moxibustion, acupuncture and other acupoint stimulations are commonly used for the correction of breech presentation. This systematic review aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of moxibustion and other acupoint stimulations to treat breech presentation. METHODS: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) on moxibustion, acupuncture or any other acupoint stimulating methods for breech presentation in pregnant women. All searches in PubMed, the Cochrane Library (2008 Issue 2), China National Knowledge Information (CNKI), Chinese Scientific Journal Database (VIP) and WanFang Database ended in July 2008. Two authors extracted and analyzed the data independently. RESULTS: Ten RCTs involving 2090 participants and seven CCTs involving 1409 participants were included in the present study. Meta-analysis showed significant differences between moxibustion and no treatment (RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.20 to 1.51; 3 RCTs). Comparison between moxibustion and knee-chest position did not show significant differences (RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.79; 3 RCTs). Moxibustion plus other therapeutic methods showed significant beneficial effects (RR 1.36, 95% CI 1.21 to 1.54; 2 RCTs). Laser stimulation was more effective than assuming the knee-chest position plus pelvis rotating. Moxibustion was more effective than no treatment (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.42; 2 CCTs) but was not more effective than the knee-chest position treatment (RR 1.22, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.34; 2 CCTs). Laser stimulation at Zhiyin (BL67) was more effective than the knee-chest position treatment (RR 1.30, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.54; 2 CCTs,). CONCLUSION: Moxibustion, acupuncture and laser acupoint stimulation tend to be effective in the correction of breech presentation.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#3489,Management of Muscle Cramps in Patients With Cirrhosis: A Systematic Review of Randomised Controlled Trials,"BACKGROUND: Muscle cramps are common in patients with cirrhosis. Despite their prevalence and impact on health-related quality of life, there are no widely used clinical practice guidelines for management of muscle cramps in cirrhosis. The aim of this review was to critically evaluate current evidence regarding treatment of muscle cramps in cirrhosis. METHODS: A systematic review using PubMed, MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase, and Scopus databases was performed on 30 June by two independent reviewers to identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs) reporting interventions for muscle cramps in cirrhotic patients. RESULTS: Twelve RCTs evaluating 13 distinct interventions were identified. Baclofen, methocarbamol, orphenadrine, and taurine supplementation reduced cramp frequency, severity, and duration when compared to placebo. Human albumin, pregabalin, and quinidine reduced cramp frequency compared to placebo. Pickle juice reduced cramp severity compared to placebo. BCAA supplementation and calcium carbonate were found to reduce cramp frequency compared to baseline. Stretching demonstrated a signal towards reducing cramp severity and frequency, and meditation had a signal towards reducing severity only when compared to baseline. Electro-acupuncture was the only intervention which demonstrated no therapeutic effect. Pregabalin was the only agent associated with significant side effects that limited its use. CONCLUSION: Methocarbamol, orphenadrine, and taurine supplementation were found in placebo-controlled RCTs to be effective in reducing cramp frequency, severity, and duration in cirrhotic patients. All other interventions reported aside from electro-acupuncture demonstrated a positive impact on cramps. High-quality RCTs are needed to further investigate the use of these treatments in terms of comparative efficacy and safety.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#3496,Effects of self-administered exercises based on Tuina techniques on musculoskeletal disorders of professional orchestra musicians: a randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Musicians are frequently affected by playing-related musculoskeletal disorders (PRMD). Common solutions used by Western medicine to treat musculoskeletal pain include rehabilitation programs and drugs, but their results are sometimes disappointing. OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of self-administered exercises based on Tuina techniques on the pain intensity caused by PRMD of professional orchestra musicians, using numeric visual scale (NVS). DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS AND INTERVENTIONS: We performed a prospective, controlled, single-blinded, randomized study with musicians suffering from PRMD. Participating musicians were randomly distributed into the experimental (n=39) and the control (n=30) groups. After an individual diagnostic assessment, specific Tuina self-administered exercises were developed and taught to the participants. Musicians were instructed to repeat the exercises every day for 3 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Pain intensity was measured by NVS before the intervention and after 1, 3, 5, 10, 15 and 20 d of treatment. The procedure was the same for the control group, however the Tuina exercises were executed in points away from the commonly-used acupuncture points. RESULTS: In the treatment group, but not the control group, pain intensity was significantly reduced on days 1, 3, 5, 10, 15 and 20. CONCLUSION: The results obtained are consistent with the hypothesis that self-administered exercises based on Tuina techniques could help professional musicians controlling the pain caused by PRMD. Although our results are very promising, further studies are needed employing a larger sample size and double blinding designs.",No,No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No
#3506,A comparison of the effects of fire needle and routine acupuncture for myofascitis: A protocol for systematic review and meta-analysis,"BACKGROUND: Myofascitis is a common disease in clinic. The main cause of the disease is aseptic inflammation of local muscles and connective tissues such as myofascial, which can be manifested as paralysis, distension, and other discomfort, local muscle stiffness, spasm or palpable strain-like nodules. Chinese medicine ascribes it to ""bi disease"" and ""Arthralgia disease,"" while Western medicine believes that the disease is mainly due to local muscle and fascia edema and exudation caused by trauma or long-term strain, forcing nerves to jam and producing pain and other abnormal feelings. Although the disease is not life-threatening, the pain and distension caused by local inflammatory stimuli can affect the patient's daily life and sleep quality. The purpose of this systematic review is to evaluate the efficacy of fire needle vs routine acupuncture in the treatment of myofascitis. METHODS: Randomized controlled trials (RCTS) of fire needle vs routine acupuncture for myofascial inflammation will be comprehensively searched from inception to September 2020 on PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, China Biomedical Literature (CBM), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Chongqing VIP (CQVIP), and Wanfang. Additionally, RCT registered sites, including http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov and http://www.chictr.org.cn, also will be the search. Visual analogue scale (VAS) was used to score the pain before and after treatment. The primary outcome will be to compare the difference in pain scores between the 2 interventions. Two independent authors filtered the literature in the above database, extracted the data, and cross-checked it. RESULTS: This study will offer a reasonable comprehensive evidence for the treatment of myofascitis with fire needle. CONCLUSION: The conclusion of this study will provide evidence to judge the effectiveness of fire needle on myofascitis. REGISTRATION NUMBER: INPLASY202080034.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#3520,Interventions for preventing nausea and vomiting in women undergoing regional anaesthesia for caesarean section,"BACKGROUND: Nausea and vomiting are distressing symptoms which are experienced commonly during caesarean section under regional anaesthesia and in the postoperative period.  OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions versus placebo or no intervention given prophylactically to prevent nausea and vomiting in women undergoing regional anaesthesia for caesarean section. SEARCH METHODS: For this update, we searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (16 April 2020), and reference lists of retrieved studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of studies and conference abstracts, and excluded quasi-RCTs and cross-over studies. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Review authors independently assessed the studies for inclusion, assessed risk of bias and carried out data extraction. Our primary outcomes are intraoperative and postoperative nausea and vomiting. Data entry was checked. Two review authors independently assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. MAIN RESULTS: Eighty-four studies (involving 10,990 women) met our inclusion criteria. Sixty-nine studies, involving 8928 women, contributed data. Most studies involved women undergoing elective caesarean section. Many studies were small with unclear risk of bias and sometimes few events. The overall certainty of the evidence assessed using GRADE was moderate to very low. 5-HT(3) antagonists: We found intraoperative nausea may be reduced by 5-HT(3) antagonists (average risk ratio (aRR) 0.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.42 to 0.71, 12 studies, 1419 women, low-certainty evidence). There may be a reduction in intraoperative vomiting but the evidence is very uncertain (aRR 0.46, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.73, 11 studies, 1414 women, very low-certainty evidence). There is probably a reduction in postoperative nausea (aRR 0.40, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.54, 10 studies, 1340 women, moderate-certainty evidence), and these drugs may show a reduction in postoperative vomiting (aRR 0.47, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.69, 10 studies, 1450 women, low-certainty evidence). Dopamine antagonists: We found dopamine antagonists may reduce intraoperative nausea but the evidence is very uncertain (aRR 0.38, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.52, 15 studies, 1180 women, very low-certainty evidence). Dopamine antagonists may reduce intraoperative vomiting (aRR 0.41, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.60, 12 studies, 942 women, low-certainty evidence) and postoperative nausea (aRR 0.61, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.79, 7 studies, 601 women, low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain if dopamine antagonists reduce postoperative vomiting (aRR 0.63, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.92, 9 studies, 860 women, very low-certainty evidence). Corticosteroids (steroids): We are uncertain if intraoperative nausea is reduced by corticosteroids (aRR 0.56, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.83, 6 studies, 609 women, very low-certainty evidence) similarly for intraoperative vomiting (aRR 0.52, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.87, 6 studies, 609 women, very low-certainty evidence). Corticosteroids probably reduce postoperative nausea (aRR 0.59, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.73, 6 studies, 733 women, moderate-certainty evidence), and may reduce postoperative vomiting (aRR 0.68, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.95, 7 studies, 793 women, low-certainty evidence). Antihistamines: Antihistamines may have little to no effect on intraoperative nausea (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.47 to 2.11, 1 study, 149 women, very low-certainty evidence) or intraoperative vomiting (no events in the one study of 149 women). Antihistamines may reduce postoperative nausea (aRR 0.44, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.64, 4 studies, 514 women, low-certainty evidence), however, we are uncertain whether antihistamines reduce postoperative vomiting (average RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.81, 3 studies, 333 women, very low-certainty evidence). Anticholinergics: Anticholinergics may reduce intraoperative nausea (aRR 0.67, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.87, 4 studies, 453 women, low-certainty evidence) but may have little to no effect on intraoperative vomiting (aRR 0.79, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.54, 4 studies; 453 women, very low-certainty evidence). No studies looked at anticholinergics in postoperative nausea, but they may reduce postoperative vomiting (aRR 0.55, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.74, 1 study, 161 women, low-certainty evidence). Sedatives: We found that sedatives probably reduce intraoperative nausea (aRR 0.65, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.82, 8 studies, 593 women, moderate-certainty evidence) and intraoperative vomiting (aRR 0.35, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.52, 8 studies, 593 women, moderate-certainty evidence). However, we are uncertain whether sedatives reduce postoperative nausea (aRR 0.25, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.71, 2 studies, 145 women, very low-certainty evidence) and they may reduce postoperative vomiting (aRR 0.09, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.28, 2 studies, 145 women, low-certainty evidence). Opioid antagonists: There were no studies assessing intraoperative nausea or vomiting. Opioid antagonists may result in little or no difference to the number of women having postoperative nausea (aRR 0.75, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.45, 1 study, 120 women, low-certainty evidence) or postoperative vomiting (aRR 1.25, 95% CI 0.35 to 4.43, 1 study, 120 women, low-certainty evidence). Acupressure: It is uncertain whether acupressure/acupuncture reduces intraoperative nausea (aRR 0.55, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.74, 9 studies, 1221 women, very low-certainty evidence). Acupressure may reduce intraoperative vomiting (aRR 0.52, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.80, 9 studies, 1221 women, low-certainty evidence) but it is uncertain whether it reduces postoperative nausea (aRR 0.46, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.75, 7 studies, 1069 women, very low-certainty evidence) or postoperative vomiting (aRR 0.52, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.79, 7 studies, 1069 women, very low-certainty evidence). Ginger: It is uncertain whether ginger makes any difference to the number of women having intraoperative nausea (aRR 0.66, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.21, 2 studies, 331 women, very low-certainty evidence), intraoperative vomiting (aRR 0.62, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.00, 2 studies, 331 women, very low-certainty evidence), postoperative nausea (aRR 0.63, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.77, 1 study, 92 women, very low-certainty evidence) and postoperative vomiting (aRR 0.20, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.65, 1 study, 92 women, very low-certainty evidence). Few studies assessed our secondary outcomes including adverse effects or women's views. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This review indicates that 5-HT(3) antagonists, dopamine antagonists, corticosteroids, sedatives and acupressure probably or possibly have efficacy in reducing nausea and vomiting in women undergoing regional anaesthesia for caesarean section. However the certainty of evidence varied widely and was generally low. Future research is needed to assess side effects of treatment, women's views and to compare the efficacy of combinations of different medications.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#3535,Interventions for nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy,"BACKGROUND: Nausea, retching and vomiting are very commonly experienced by women in early pregnancy. There are considerable physical and psychological effects on women who experience these symptoms. This is an update of a review of interventions for nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy previously published in 2003. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness and safety of all interventions for nausea, vomiting and retching in early pregnancy, up to 20 weeks' gestation. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (28 May 2010). SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomised controlled trials of any intervention for nausea, vomiting and retching in early pregnancy. We excluded trials of interventions for hyperemesis gravidarum which are covered by another review. We also excluded quasi-randomised trials and trials using a crossover design. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Four review authors, in pairs, reviewed the eligibility of trials and independently evaluated the risk of bias and extracted the data for included trials. MAIN RESULTS: Twenty-seven trials, with 4041 women, met the inclusion criteria. These trials covered many interventions, including acupressure, acustimulation, acupuncture, ginger, vitamin B6 and several antiemetic drugs. We identified no studies of dietary or other lifestyle interventions. Evidence regarding the effectiveness of P6 acupressure, auricular (ear) acupressure and acustimulation of the P6 point was limited. Acupuncture (P6 or traditional) showed no significant benefit to women in pregnancy. The use of ginger products may be helpful to women, but the evidence of effectiveness was limited and not consistent. There was only limited evidence from trials to support the use of pharmacological agents including vitamin B6, and anti-emetic drugs to relieve mild or moderate nausea and vomiting. There was little information on maternal and fetal adverse outcomes and on psychological, social or economic outcomes. We were unable to pool findings from studies for most outcomes due to heterogeneity in study participants, interventions, comparison groups, and outcomes measured or reported. The methodological quality of the included studies was mixed. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Given the high prevalence of nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy, health professionals need to provide clear guidance to women, based on systematically reviewed evidence. There is a lack of high-quality evidence to support that advice. The difficulties in interpreting the results of the studies included in this review highlight the need for specific, consistent and clearly justified outcomes and approaches to measurement in research studies.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#3541,Electroacupuncture at Jing-jiaji points for neck pain caused by cervical spondylosis: a study protocol for a randomized controlled pilot trial,"BACKGROUND: Neck pain caused by cervical spondylosis (CS) has become one of the most common health problems around the world. Electroacupuncture (EA) has been employed to relieve CS neck pain, but there is limited clinical evidence for its effectiveness. METHODS/DESIGN: This study consists of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with two parallel arms: an acupuncture group and an EA group. Both groups will receive acupuncture at Jing-jiaji points for 30 minutes each time, for five sessions per week for a total of 20 sessions during this four-week period. In addition, the EA group will be connected with EA apparatus. The following outcome measurements will be used in examination of subjects: the Northwick Park Neck Pain Questionnaire (NPQ), McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ), and Short-Form 36 (SF-36) scale. All these outcomes will be examined at the start of the study, at the end of the second week, at four weeks after randomization, and one and three months after treatment cessation respectively. DISCUSSION: This study aims to assess the efficacy of EA, compared with acupuncture intervention at Jing-jiaji points for the CS neck pain.

#3583,"Efficacy and safety of acupuncture combined with auricular acupressure for smoking cessation: A study protocol of a multicentre, randomized, controlled clinical trial","BACKGROUND: Nicotine dependence is an addictive behavioral disease facilitated by habitually smoking cigarettes. In many countries, acupuncture and auricular acupressure have attracted growing attention as complementary or alternative treatments for smoking cessation; however, there is a lack of rigorous randomized, controlled studies evaluating the combination of these two interventions specifically for smoking cessation. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of using acupuncture combined with auricular acupressure (A&AA) to increase the rates of smoking cessation and ultimately reduce the rates of relapse. METHODS: This is a multicentre, prospective, parallel, randomized, controlled trial. A total of 360 patients with severe nicotine dependence will be randomized into test (A&AA) or control (nicotine replacement therapy, NRT) groups. The test group will be treated with A&AA twice weekly, while the control group will use an NRT patch daily. All treatments will be administered for 8 weeks, with a follow-up period of 4 months. The primary outcome will be the smoking abstinence rate at week 24, with a combined safety assessment. The secondary outcomes will be smoking cessation rates at other timepoints, saliva cortisone test results, and scores on the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence, the Autonomy over Tobacco Scale, the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, the Self-rating Anxiety Scale, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. The cost of treatment will also be used to evaluate the economic effects of different smoking cessation interventions. Statistical analysis on the data collected from both the intention-to-treat (all randomly assigned patients) and per-protocol (patients who complete the trial without any protocol deviations) patients, will be performed using the statistical software package, IBM SPSS 27.0. DISCUSSION: This study will provide rigorous clinical evidence evaluating the efficacy and safety of using A&AA as a smoking cessation therapy.

#3586,Effect of acupuncture combined with lower limb gait rehabilitation robot on improving walking function in stroke patients with hemiplegia,"BACKGROUND: No study has yet demonstrated the effect of lower limb gait rehabilitation robot treatment combined with acupuncture on stroke patients. OBJECTIVE: To explore the effect of acupuncture combined with lower limb gait rehabilitation robot on walking function in patients with hemiplegia after stroke. METHODS: Fifty-six patients with hemiplegia after stroke were enrolled and randomly divided into two groups. The control group received regular rehabilitation training and acupuncture therapy; the intervention group was additionally trained by AiWalker-I lower limb gait robot. Both groups received 5 sessions a week for 4 weeks. Walking function parameters were assessed before and after the 4-week treatment. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in all parameters between the two groups in baseline (P > 0.05). After 4 weeks of treatment, all parameters including the effectiveness of functional ambulation category (FAC), time up and go test (TUGT) time, Wisconsin gait scale (WGS) score, walking spatiotemporal parameters were all significantly improved in both groups with a significant better effect in the intervention group (P < 0.05).

#3613,Patients' perceptions on non-specific effects of acupuncture: Qualitative comparison between responders and non-responders,"BACKGROUND: Non-specific effect of acupuncture constitutes part of the overall effect generated via clinical encounter beyond needle insertion and stimulation. It is unclear how responders and non-responders of acupuncture experience non-specific effects differently. We aimed to compare their experiences in a nested qualitative study embedded in an acupuncture randomized trial on functional dyspepsia. METHODS: Purposive sampling was used to capture experience of responders (n=15) and non-responders (n=15) to acupuncture via individual in-depth interviews. Design and analysis followed a framework analysis approach, with reference to an existing model on acupuncture non-specific effects. Themes emerging outside of this model were purposefully explored. RESULTS: Responders had a more trusting relationship with acupuncturist in response to their expression of empathy. In turn they were more actively engaged in lifestyle modifications and dietary advice offered by acupuncturists. Non-responders were not satisfied with the level of reassurance regarding acupuncture safety. They were also expecting more peer support from fellow participants, regarded that as an empowerment process for initiating and sustaining lifestyle changes. CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlighted key differences in acupuncture non-specific effect components experienced by responders and non-responders. Positive non-specific effects contributing to overall benefits could be enhanced by emphasizing on empathy expression from acupuncturists, trust-building, offering appropriate explanations on safety, and organizing patient support groups. Further research on the relative importance of each component is warranted.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#3615,Observation of curative effect on meridian theory-based extracorporeal shock wave therapy for non-specific low back pain: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Non-specific low back pain (NLBP) is a major global socioeconomic burden, and the prevalence of NLBP is still on the rise. At present, there is no ideal drug to cure this disease. This may be the reason why patients often use complementary therapies. Among them, extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) has gradually received more attention and has become the main treatment method for NLBP. The purpose of this study is to provide scientific evidence for the effect and safety of meridian theory-based ESWT on NLBP. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the effect and safety of meridian theory-based ESWT on NLBP. This study will also provide more high-quality experimental evidence for the clinical application of meridian theory-based ESWT for the treatment of NLBP in future. METHODS: The study design is a single-blind, multi-center, randomized controlled trial. 66 patients with NLBP, aged 18 to 60 years, will be randomly divided into two groups: the experimental group (N = 33), which will receive meridian theory-based ESWT application, and the control group (N = 33) which will receive conventional ESWT treatment. These two applications will be carried out twice a week for two weeks. The primary outcome will be the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), and the secondary outcomes will be Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), Surface Electromyography (sEMG), and Patient Health Questionnaire-15 (PHQ-15). All outcomes will be evaluated at baseline and after the intervention (7 days, 14 days). DISCUSSION: Results of this trial will contribute to providing rigorous clinical evidence for the efficacy and security of meridian theory-based ESWT for NLBP.

#3623,Efficacy of acupuncture for functional constipation in elderly: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"BACKGROUND: Numerous clinical studies have shown that patients suffering from functional constipation can benefit by combining medication with acupuncture. There have been no published reviews or meta-analyses regarding the use of acupuncture in treating functional constipation in older adults. Therefore, we carried out a meta-analysis to assess the impact of acupuncture on elderly patients dealing with functional constipation. METHODS: This study retrieved randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on acupuncture therapy for functional constipation in the elderly from several electronic databases, including Embase, PubMed, Cochrane Library, Wanfang Database, Chinese BioMedical Literature Database, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure. In these databases, clinical investigators evaluated the effectiveness of acupuncture as a primary treatment for elderly people with functional constipation. The Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions was used by researchers to evaluate the quality of the study. RESULTS: A total of 469 elderly individuals were included in 8 RCTs. The meta-analysis yielded compelling findings: the application of acupuncture has significantly elevated the rates of treatment effectiveness compared to the control group. Compared with the control group, the treatment group exhibited a statistically significant difference in complete spontaneous bowel movements after treatment. The two groups showed no significant difference in spontaneous bowel movements. However, there was a significant difference in the Bristol Stool Scale scores. The Defecation Difficulty Score and Patient Assessment of Constipation Quality of Life (PAC-QOL) showed p-values that indicated no significant effect. However, acupuncture improved bowel movements, demonstrating a significant difference in the Clinic Constipation Score (CCS) when comparing the two groups. The Nitric Oxide Synthase (NOS) and 5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) contents changed significantly after intervention in both groups. An article reported that the improvement of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) symptom scores was better in the treatment group than in the control group. CONCLUSION: The analysis results indicated that acupuncture can be beneficial for elderly people with functional constipation; however, strong and comprehensive data are not yet obtainable. Given that our study is based on evidence that is of a low-to-moderate quality, further high-quality research is necessary to enhance the feasibility and practicability of this treatment.

#3636,Acupuncture vs sham acupuncture for simple obesity: A protocol for systematic review and meta-analysis,"BACKGROUND: Obesity is a growing chronic health problem worldwide. Studies about acupuncture for obesity treatment are many. But there are some doubts about the effectiveness of acupuncture vs sham acupuncture in treating obesity due to its lack of an evidence-based medical proof. Therefore, the aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of acupuncture for obesity treatment and provide clinic evidence. METHODS: This protocol was based on the previous reporting items for systematic review and meta-analysis agreements. Four English databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) and 4 Chinese databases (China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese BioMedical Database, Chinese Scientific Journal Database, Wan-Fang Data) will be searched from their receptions to August 2019. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) using acupuncture compared sham acupuncture (or no treatment) to treat simple obesity will be included. The primary outcome of body mass index (BMI) and body weight (BW) will be used to measure the effect of acupuncture on obesity. According to the trial data extraction form based on the Cochrane Handbook, 2 reviewers will separately extract the data. Risk of bias of the RCTs will be assessed by the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. Publication bias will be assessed with funnel plots. RESULTS: This study will be to evaluate whether acupuncture is an effective intervention for simple obesity when compared with sham acupuncture. CONCLUSION: The conclusion of this study will help clinicians provide effective treatment options for obese patients. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval is not required for systematic review and meta- analysis. The results of this review will be disseminated in a peer-review journal.

#3638,Electroacupuncture Exerts Anti-Obesity Effects by Affecting the Gut Microbiota and Upregulating Acetic Acid and 5-HT Levels in Obese Rats,"BACKGROUND: Obesity is a highly prevalent metabolic disorder that significantly increases the risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Acupuncture has demonstrated remarkable efficacy in treating obesity, offering substantial societal health benefits. OBJECTIVE: Electroacupuncture has shown promise in the treatment of obesity (OB). The development of obesity is directly linked to the gut microbiota. Therefore, we aimed to explore the mechanism by which electroacupuncture alleviates obesity induced by a high-fat diet (HFD) by modulating the gut microbiota. METHODS: Fifty specific pathogen-free Sprague-Dawley (male) rats were obtained, and 44 rats were randomly selected and subjected to an HFD. The remaining six rats were used as controls and subjected to a basic diet. The successfully-induced-obese rats were randomly divided into four groups: the obese group (n=6), the obese+electroacupuncture group (n=6), the obese+antibiotic group (n=6), and the obese+antibiotic+electroacupuncture group (n=6). Furthermore, the weight-reducing effect of electroacupuncture was investigated in HFD-induced obese rats by monitoring their body weight, food consumption, Lee's index, blood fat, and liver steatosis. The levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), gut microbiota composition, and short-chain fatty acid content were measured and characterized. RESULTS: Electroacupuncture significantly reduced body weight in obese rats and alleviated lipid metabolism disorders. Furthermore, it also improved the number, abundance, and structure of the gut microbiota in obese rats and increased acetic acid and 5-HT content. Moreover, Lactobacillus faecis (L. faecis) and Bacteroides fragilis (B. fragilis) were correlated with obesity-related indicators, acetic acid levels, and 5-HT content. CONCLUSION: Electroacupuncture may exert anti-obesity effects by modulating acetic acid levels and 5-HT release by intestinal enterochromaffin cells. L. faecis and B. fragilis in the gut microbiota may be potential targets for the treatment of obesity in the future.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#3687,Evaluation of the Therapeutic Effect of Traditional Chinese Medicine on Osteoarthritis: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common degenerative disease of bone and joint characterized by the damage of articular cartilage and hypertonia, which often occurs in the middle-aged and elderly. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) therapy, including acupuncture (ACU), oral administration, and external use of traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs), can significantly improve the therapeutic effect on OA and reduce the occurrence of side effects. We provide a latest meta-analysis on the treatment of OA with TCM. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the electronic database, appropriate articles without language restrictions on keywords were selected until August 1, 2019. All trajectories are screened according to certain criteria. The quality of qualified research was also assessed. We have made a detailed record of the results of the measurement. Meta-analysis was carried out with Revman 5.3 software. RESULTS: Forty-four articles involving 4014 patients (2012 cases in the experimental group and 2002 cases in the control group) with OA were selected. This article focuses on the study of the treatment of OA by using the general mode of TCM. The quality evaluation included in the study was evaluated independently according to the Cochrane intervention system evaluation manual. In this meta-analysis, 68.18% of the literature correctly described the conditions for the generation of random assignment sequences, only 6.82% of the literature correctly mentioned the hidden details of allocation, and all studies mentioned randomly assigned participants. Compared with Western medicine, the total effective rate (TER) of OA treatment in TCM was significantly increased and the recurrence rate (RR) was significantly decreased (P < 0.00001). In addition, the experimental group was also superior to the control group in terms of the indicators of joint activity function, inflammatory factor content, and various indicators affecting bone metabolism. It can be showed by the network analysis diagram that Aconiti Radix, Achyranthis Bidentatae Radix, and other TCMs can inhibit inflammatory stimulation and relieve the pain symptoms of patients with OA. ACU at Yinlingquan, Xiyan, and other acupoints can effectively improve the clinical symptoms of patients with OA. CONCLUSION: TCM therapy in treatment of patients with OA could effectively restore joint function, enhance the TER, and reduce RR. However, the results of this study should be handled with care due to the limitations existing. Some rigorous randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are needed to confirm these findings.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#3689,Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation for knee osteoarthritis,"BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a disease that affects synovial joints, which mainly causes degeneration and destruction of hyaline cartilage. To date, no curative treatment for OA exists. The primary goals for OA therapy are to relieve pain, maintain or improve functional status, and minimize deformity. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is a noninvasive modality in physiotherapy that is commonly used to control both acute and chronic pain arising from several conditions. A number of trials evaluating the efficacy of TENS in OA have been published. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of TENS in the treatment of knee OA. The primary outcomes of interest were those described by the Outcome Measures in Rheumatology Clinical Trials (OMERACT) 3, which included pain relief, functional status, patient global assessment, and change in joint imaging for studies of one year or longer. The secondary objective was to determine the most effective mode of TENS application in pain control. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, HEALTHSTAR, PEDro, Current Contents and the Cochrane Controlled Trial Register using the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Group search strategy for trials up to and including December 1999. We also hand-searched reference lists and consulted content experts. SELECTION CRITERIA: Two independent reviewers selected the trials that met predetermined inclusion criteria. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two independent reviewers extracted the data using standardized forms and assessed the quality of randomization, blinding and dropouts. A third reviewer was consulted to resolve any differences. For dichotomous outcomes, relative risks (RR) were calculated. For continuous data, weighted mean differences (WMD) or standardized mean difference (SMD) of the change from baseline were calculated. A fixed effects model was used unless heterogeneity of the populations existed. In this case, a random effects model was used. MAIN RESULTS: Seven trials were eligible to be included in this review. Six used TENS as the active treatment while one study used acupuncture-like TENS (AL-TENS). A number of 148 and 146 patients were involved in the active TENS treatment and placebo, respectively. Three studies were cross-over studies and the others were parallel group, randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Median methodological quality of these studies was two. Pain relief from active TENS and AL-TENS treatment was significantly better than placebo treatment. Knee stiffness also improved significantly in active treatment group compared to placebo. Different modes of TENS setting (High Rate and Strong Burst Mode TENS) demonstrated a significant benefit in pain relief of the knee OA over placebo. Subgroup analyses showed a heterogeneity in the studies with methodological quality of three or more and those with repeated TENS applications. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: TENS and AL-TENS are shown to be effective in pain control over placebo in this review. Heterogeneity of the included studies was observed, which might be due to the different study designs and outcomes used. More well designed studies with a standardized protocol and adequate number of participants are needed to conclude the effectiveness of TENS in the treatment of OA of the knee.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#3705,A pilot controlled trial of a combination of dense cranial electroacupuncture stimulation and body acupuncture for post-stroke depression,"BACKGROUND: Our previous studies have demonstrated the treatment benefits of dense cranial electroacupuncture stimulation (DCEAS), a novel brain stimulation therapy in patients with major depression, postpartum depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder. The purpose of the present study was to further evaluate the effectiveness of DCEAS combined with body acupuncture and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in patients with post-stroke depression (PSD). METHODS: In a single-blind, randomized controlled trial, 43 patients with PSD were randomly assigned to 12 sessions of DCEAS plus SSRI plus body electroacupuncture (n = 23), or sham (non-invasive cranial electroacupuncture, n-CEA) plus SSRI plus body electroacupuncture (n = 20) for 3 sessions per week over 4 weeks. Treatment outcomes were measured using the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17), the Clinical Global Impression - Severity scale (CGI-S) and Barthel Index (BI), a measure used to evaluate movement ability associated with daily self-caring activity. RESULTS: DCEAS produced a significantly greater reduction of both HAMD-17 and CGI-S as early as week 1 and CGI-S at endpoint compared to n-CEA, but subjects of n-CEA group exhibited a significantly greater improvement on BI at week 4 than DCEAS. Incidence of adverse events was not different in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that DCEAS could be effective in reducing stroke patients' depressive symptoms. Superficial electrical stimulation in n-CEA group may be beneficial in improving movement disability of stroke patients. A combination of DCEAS and body acupuncture can be considered a treatment option for neuropsychiatric sequelae of stroke.

#3717,Effectiveness and safety of acupuncture for elderly overactive bladder population in Hong Kong: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Overactive bladder (OAB) is defined as ""urgency, with or without urge incontinence, usually with frequency and nocturia"". Acupuncture is one of the most popular alternative treatment methods for OAB. Little established evidence is available to support the effectiveness of acupuncture for OAB. This study is a pioneer randomized, double-blinded, sham-controlled trial to assess the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture in the elderly population with overactive bladder in Hong Kong. METHODS/DESIGN: This is a randomized, double-center, patient and outcome assessor blinded, sham-controlled trial. The study sample size is 100 patients. Eligible subjects aged between 60 to 90 years old will be recruited into this study. All subjects will be randomly allocated into the active acupuncture group or sham acupuncture group in a 1: 1 ratio. Participants who are allocated into the active acupuncture group will receive a standardized 30-min real acupuncture treatment session for a total of 16 sessions on the top of standard routine care, whilst those who are randomized to the sham acupuncture arm will receive sham acupuncture in addition to standard routine care. Non-penetrating needles will be utilized as sham acupuncture. The primary outcome measure is the 7-day voiding diary and the secondary outcome measures are urine nerve growth factor (NGF) level, the Incontinence Impact Questionnaire (IIQ-7), Urogenital Distress Inventory (UDI-6) and OAB Symptom Score (OABSS). All outcome measures will be collected at baseline, the end of treatment and 3 months after treatment completion. DISCUSSION: The objectives of this study include (1) to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture treatment in patients with OAB on reduction in the frequency of incontinence episodes as derived from a 7-day voiding diary, (2) to evaluate whether acupuncture treatment could improve subjective symptoms in patients with OAB and (3) to examine the feasibility of using NGF as a biomarker for overactive bladder and test correlation with the effectiveness of acupuncture intervention. The finding of this study will provide preliminary evidence on the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture for treatment of OAB.

#3727,"Efficacy and safety of electroacupuncture for oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy in colorectal cancer patients: a single-blinded, randomized, sham-controlled trial","BACKGROUND: Oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy is a major first-line conventional therapy for advanced and metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC). However, oxaliplatin causes chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). Acupuncture has long been used to alleviate limb numbness in Chinese medicine practice. AIM: The aim of this study was to examine the efficacy and safety of electroacupuncture (EA) for the alleviation of CIPN in CRC patients. DESIGN: This was a pilot single-blinded, randomized, sham-controlled trial. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Sixty eligible patients, who had been diagnosed with CRC and were undergoing oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy, were randomized in a ratio of 1:1 to the EA intervention group or sham acupuncture (SA) control group. During a 12-week treatment period, patients in the EA group received EA once a week, while patients in the SA group received SA; both groups were followed up for 12 weeks. RESULTS: Compared with the SA group, the EA group exhibited significant alleviation of CIPN severity during chemotherapy. Moreover, EA also improved the physical function, role function, and social function of CRC patients. However, there were no significant differences in tests of vibration or light touch sensation. In addition, EA appeared to be a safe treatment for CIPN and was both feasible and acceptable to CRC patients during chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: This study showed preliminary evidence for the efficacy and safety of EA in acute CIPN among CRC patients, although further studies are needed to verify these effects and to further explore the potential role of EA in chronic CIPN (effects on which remain unclear).

#3729,Complementary and alternative therapies for post-caesarean pain,"BACKGROUND: Pain after caesarean sections (CS) can affect the well-being of the mother and her ability with her newborn. Conventional pain-relieving strategies are often underused because of concerns about the adverse maternal and neonatal effects. Complementary alternative therapies (CAM) may offer an alternative for post-CS pain. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of CAM for post-caesarean pain. SEARCH METHODS: We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register, LILACS, PEDro, CAMbase, ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (6 September 2019), and checked the reference lists of retrieved articles. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including quasi-RCTs and cluster-RCTs, comparing CAM, alone or associated with other forms of pain relief, versus other treatments or placebo or no treatment, for the treatment of post-CS pain. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently performed study selection, extracted data, assessed risk of bias and assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE. MAIN RESULTS: We included 37 studies (3076 women) which investigated eight different CAM therapies for post-CS pain relief. There is substantial heterogeneity among the trials. We downgraded the certainty of evidence due to small numbers of women participating in the trials and to risk of bias related to lack of blinding and inadequate reporting of randomisation processes. None of the trials reported pain at six weeks after discharge. Primary outcomes were pain and adverse effects, reported per intervention below. Secondary outcomes included vital signs, rescue analgesic requirement at six weeks after discharge; all of which were poorly reported, not reported, or we are uncertain as to the effect Acupuncture or acupressure We are very uncertain if acupuncture or acupressure (versus no treatment) or acupuncture or acupressure plus analgesia (versus placebo plus analgesia) has any effect on pain because the quality of evidence is very low. Acupuncture or acupressure plus analgesia (versus analgesia) may reduce pain at 12 hours (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.64 to 0.07; 130 women; 2 studies; low-certainty evidence) and 24 hours (SMD -0.63, 95% CI -0.99 to -0.26; 2 studies; 130 women; low-certainty evidence). It is uncertain whether acupuncture or acupressure (versus no treatment) or acupuncture or acupressure plus analgesia (versus analgesia) has any effect on the risk of adverse effects because the quality of evidence is very low. Aromatherapy Aromatherapy plus analgesia may reduce pain when compared with placebo plus analgesia at 12 hours (mean difference (MD) -2.63 visual analogue scale (VAS), 95% CI -3.48 to -1.77; 3 studies; 360 women; low-certainty evidence) and 24 hours (MD -3.38 VAS, 95% CI -3.85 to -2.91; 1 study; 200 women; low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain if aromatherapy plus analgesia has any effect on adverse effects (anxiety) compared with placebo plus analgesia. Electromagnetic therapy Electromagnetic therapy may reduce pain compared with placebo plus analgesia at 12 hours (MD -8.00, 95% CI -11.65 to -4.35; 1 study; 72 women; low-certainty evidence) and 24 hours (MD -13.00 VAS, 95% CI -17.13 to -8.87; 1 study; 72 women; low-certainty evidence). Massage We identified six studies (651 women), five of which were quasi-RCTs, comparing massage (foot and hand) plus analgesia versus analgesia. All the evidence relating to pain, adverse effects (anxiety), vital signs and rescue analgesic requirement was very low-certainty. Music Music plus analgesia may reduce pain when compared with placebo plus analgesia at one hour (SMD -0.84, 95% CI -1.23 to -0.46; participants = 115; studies = 2; I(2) = 0%; low-certainty evidence), 24 hours (MD -1.79, 95% CI -2.67 to -0.91; 1 study; 38 women; low-certainty evidence), and also when compared with analgesia at one hour (MD -2.11, 95% CI -3.11 to -1.10; 1 study; 38 women; low-certainty evidence) and at 24 hours (MD -2.69, 95% CI -3.67 to -1.70; 1 study; 38 women; low-certainty evidence). It is uncertain whether music plus analgesia has any effect on adverse effects (anxiety), when compared with placebo plus analgesia because the quality of evidence is very low. Reiki We are uncertain if Reiki plus analgesia compared with analgesia alone has any effect on pain, adverse effects, vital signs or rescue analgesic requirement because the quality of evidence is very low (one study, 90 women). Relaxation Relaxation may reduce pain compared with standard care at 24 hours (MD -0.53 VAS, 95% CI -1.05 to -0.01; 1 study; 60 women; low-certainty evidence). Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation TENS (versus no treatment) may reduce pain at one hour (MD -2.26, 95% CI -3.35 to -1.17; 1 study; 40 women; low-certainty evidence). TENS plus analgesia (versus placebo plus analgesia) may reduce pain compared with placebo plus analgesia at one hour (SMD -1.10 VAS, 95% CI -1.37 to -0.82; 3 studies; 238 women; low-certainty evidence) and at 24 hours (MD -0.70 VAS, 95% CI -0.87 to -0.53; 108 women; 1 study; low-certainty evidence). TENS plus analgesia (versus placebo plus analgesia) may reduce heart rate (MD -7.00 bpm, 95% CI -7.63 to -6.37; 108 women; 1 study; low-certainty evidence) and respiratory rate (MD -1.10 brpm, 95% CI -1.26 to -0.94; 108 women; 1 study; low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain if TENS plus analgesia (versus analgesia) has any effect on pain at six hours or 24 hours, or vital signs because the quality of evidence is very low (two studies, 92 women). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Some CAM therapies may help reduce post-CS pain for up to 24 hours. The evidence on adverse events is too uncertain to make any judgements on safety and we have no evidence about the longer-term effects on pain. Since pain control is the most relevant outcome for post-CS women and their clinicians, it is important that future studies of CAM for post-CS pain measure pain as a primary outcome, preferably as the proportion of participants with at least moderate (30%) or substantial (50%) pain relief. Measuring pain as a dichotomous variable would improve the certainty of evidence and it is easy to understand for non-specialists. Future trials also need to be large enough to detect effects on clinical outcomes; measure other important outcomes as listed lin this review, and use validated scales.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#3730,Pain management after elective craniotomy: A systematic review with procedure-specific postoperative pain management (PROSPECT) recommendations,"BACKGROUND: Pain after craniotomy can be intense and its management is often suboptimal. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to evaluate the available literature and develop recommendations for optimal pain management after craniotomy. DESIGN: A systematic review using procedure-specific postoperative pain management (PROSPECT) methodology was undertaken. DATA SOURCES: Randomised controlled trials and systematic reviews published in English from 1 January 2010 to 30 June 2021 assessing pain after craniotomy using analgesic, anaesthetic or surgical interventions were identified from MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane Databases. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Each randomised controlled trial (RCT) and systematic review was critically evaluated and included only if met the PROSPECT requirements. Included studies were evaluated for clinically relevant differences in pain scores, use of nonopioid analgesics, such as paracetamol and NSAIDs, and current clinical relevance. RESULTS: Out of 126 eligible studies identified, 53 RCTs and seven systematic review or meta-analyses met the inclusion criteria. Pre-operative and intra-operative interventions that improved postoperative pain were paracetamol, NSAIDs, intravenous dexmedetomidine infusion, regional analgesia techniques, including incision-site infiltration, scalp nerve block and acupuncture. Limited evidence was found for flupirtine, intra-operative magnesium sulphate infusion, intra-operative lidocaine infusion, infiltration adjuvants (hyaluronidase, dexamethasone and α-adrenergic agonist added to local anaesthetic solution). No evidence was found for metamizole, postoperative subcutaneous sumatriptan, pre-operative oral vitamin D, bilateral maxillary block or superficial cervical plexus block. CONCLUSIONS: The analgesic regimen for craniotomy should include paracetamol, NSAIDs, intravenous dexmedetomidine infusion and a regional analgesic technique (either incision-site infiltration or scalp nerve block), with opioids as rescue analgesics. Further RCTs are required to confirm the influence of the recommended analgesic regimen on postoperative pain relief.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No

METHODS: Cancer survivors were defined as patients diagnosed with cancer who had completed active cancer treatment, whose conditions were stable, and who had no evidence of recurrent or progressive disease. A systematic search through the PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science, PsycInfo, and CINAHL databases was conducted, which targeted randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published until April 2022 that evaluated any type of treatment for pain or numbness in cancer survivors. A meta-analysis was conducted using the random-effects model to obtain the effect sizes of 7 types of treatments: opioid therapy, nonopioid pharmacotherapy, interventional therapy, acupuncture, education/cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), physical exercise, and alternative medicine. RESULTS: A total of 36 studies involving 2,870 cancer survivors were included. Among them, 35 (n=2,813) were included in the meta-analysis for pain. The analysis suggested that physical exercise [n=761; 13 studies; standardized mean difference (SMD) -0.84; 95% confidence interval (CI): -1.14 to -0.55], acupuncture (n=409; 3 studies; SMD -0.80; 95% CI: -1.04 to -0.56), and alternative medicine (n=206; 6 studies; SMD -0.44; 95% CI: -0.71 to -0.16) could significantly reduce pain. Nonopioid pharmacotherapy and education/CBT did not demonstrate significant effects. No studies were identified that investigated the effects of opioid therapy or interventional therapy on pain. Regarding numbness, 5 studies (n=566) were included in the meta-analysis. Acupuncture (n=99; 2 studies) did not demonstrate significant effects on numbness, and the effects of nonopioid pharmacotherapy, education/CBT, and physical exercise could not be determined due to the small number of included studies. No studies were identified that investigated the effects of opioid therapy, interventional therapy, or alternative medicine on numbness. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis suggested that physical exercise, acupuncture, and alternative medicine may reduce pain in cancer survivors, with a very small to moderate amount of evidence. The effect of treatments for numbness could not be determined due to the limited number of included studies. Further studies are needed, particularly on widely used pharmacotherapy.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#3736,A novel and effective acupuncture modality as a complementary therapy to acute pain relief in inpatients with rib fractures,"BACKGROUND: Pain control has been emphasized as a priority for both practitioners and inpatients with rib fractures, since analgesia could only offer limited relief from severe pain. A prospective and randomized controlled trial was conducted to analyze the efficacy and efficiency of acupuncture in acute pain relief for inpatients with rib fractures. METHODS: A total of 58 inpatients were recruited and allocated to two groups, receiving identical doses of conventional oral analgesics as well as filiform needles as treatment and thumbtack intradermal (TI) needles placed upon the skin surface as a control, respectively, via novel acupuncture modality once daily for three consecutive days. The effect of pain relief was evaluated during activities that induce pain, and sustained maximal inspiration (SMI) lung volumes and sleep quality were assessed. RESULTS: The patients treated with filiform needles had more effective pain relief than those in the TI needle group during deep breathing, coughing, and turning over the body (p < 0.05), and the effect persisted for at least 6 h in most patients. Sustained maximal inspiration lung volumes and sleep quality did not show improvement through every acupuncture intervention, and they could not respond accurately to pain relief via acupuncture. CONCLUSION: The active evaluation could provide a more adaptive model for assessing pain intensity due to rib fractures. This novel acupuncture modality in which the needle insertion sites are corresponding to the pain spots can be a safe and viable therapy for relieving pain in inpatients with rib fractures.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No
#3738,Acupuncture for pain relief of women undergoing transvaginal oocyte retrieval: A meta analysis and systematic review protocol,"BACKGROUND: Pain during oocyte retrieval, which can make the in-vitro fertilization process an unpleasant experience, is becoming a common problem. Although there are many analgesic methods available in the clinical setting, they are not therapeutically equivalent, and some are associated with varying adverse reactions. In recent years, acupuncture analgesia has been used in the perioperative period of oocyte retrieval because of its perceived efficacy and safety. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to provide evidence that acupuncture is effective in the treatment of vaginal oocyte retrieval pain. METHODS: Electronic searches of the following six databases will be conducted by two qualified reviewers: MEDLINE, EMBASE, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese Biomedical Medicine database, VIP database and Wanfang database. Three clinical trial registries will also be searched: World Health Organization International Clinical Trial Registry Platform, Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and ClinicalTrials.Gov. All searches will cover the period from inception of the database/registry to March 2020 and will be limited to publications in English and Chinese. Data identification, data selection, data extraction, and bias risk assessment will be conducted independently by3ν two or more qualified reviewers, including those who selected the studies. Visual analogue scale scores will be calculated as the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes will include results of other subjective pain rating scales, including Likert scales or other defined numerical or non-numerical scales, self-assessed by patients before, during, and after oocyte retrieval. We will use STATA software (Version 16) to perform meta-analyses, and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations framework to grade the quality of evidence. If quantitative analysis is not available, a systematic narrative synthesis will be provided. PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42020170095.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#3744,Effectiveness of different acupuncture therapies for chronic cancer pain: A protocol for systematic review and Bayesian network meta-analysis,"BACKGROUND: Pain is a common and distressing symptom experienced by cancer patients. Previous research found acupuncture was associated with significant reductions in pain intensity and opioid use. Acupuncture therapies are various, and the difference in efficacy and safety has never been assessed. This paper aims to assess and rank the effectiveness of the different acupuncture methods and provide an acupuncture treatment guideline for relieving chronic pain in cancer survivors. METHODS: Four English databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane library, and Web of Science) and 4 Chinese databases (China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Data, and Chinese Biomedical Literature Database) will be searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published from the database inception to November 30, 2021. The primary outcomes will be patient-reported pain intensity measured by the Brief Pain Inventory, Visual Analog Scale, Verbal Rating Scale, Numerical Rating Scale, and other valid outcome measures. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, and Development and Evaluation System will evaluate the quality of evidence. Bayesian network meta-analysis will be performed in WinBUGS V.1.4.3 to determine the comparative effectiveness of the acupuncture therapies. RESULTS: This study will quantify the effectiveness of each acupuncture intervention for chronic cancer pain with pain scores and the use of analgesics. The adverse events of acupuncture treatment for cancer pain will also be reported.

#3747,Differential clinical characteristics across traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) syndromes in patients with sickle cell disease,"BACKGROUND: Pain is a common, debilitating, and poorly understood complication of sickle cell disease (SCD). The need for clinical pain management of SCD is largely unmet and relies on opioids as the main therapeutic option, which leads to a decreased quality of life (QoL). According to the literature, acupuncture has shown certain therapeutic effects for pain management in SCD. However, these clinical studies lack the guidance of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) Syndrome Differentiation principles for treatment. AIM: To characterize differences in clinical presentation amongst TCM-diagnosed syndromes in SCD patients. METHOD: 52 patients with SCD and 28 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HCs) were enrolled in an ongoing trial of acupuncture. Each participant completed a series of questionnaires on pain, physical function, fatigue, sleep, anxiety, depression, and QoL and underwent cold- and pressure-based quantitative sensory testing at baseline. Data on prescription opioid use over the 12 months prior to study enrollment was used to calculate mean daily morphine milligram equivalents (MME). Differences among the three TCM syndromes were analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey post hoc testing. Two-sample t-tests were used to compare SCD and HC groups. RESULTS: TCM diagnosis criteria classified SCD patients into one of three TCM syndromes: a) Equal; b) Deficiency; and c) Stagnation. The Stagnation group exhibited higher pain interference, physical dysfunction, nociplastic pain, fatigue, anxiety, depression, MME consumption, and lower sleep quality and QoL compared to the Equal group. Few differences were observed between HCs and the Equal SCD group across outcomes. Deficiency and Stagnation groups were differentiated with observed- and patient-reported clinical manifestations. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that TCM-diagnosed syndromes in SCD can be differentially characterized using validated objective and patient-reported outcomes. Because characteristics of pain and co-morbidities in each SCD patient are unique, targeting specific TCM ""syndromes"" may facilitate treatment effectiveness with a syndrome-based personalized treatment plan that conforms to TCM principles. These findings lay the foundation for the development of tailored acupuncture interventions based on TCM syndromes for managing pain in SCD. Larger samples are required to further refine and validate TCM diagnostic criteria for SCD.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#3750,"The Effect of Electroacupuncture Therapy on Pain, Plasma β-Endorphin, and Quality of Life of Stage III Cervical Cancer Patients: A Randomized Control Trial","BACKGROUND: Pain is a major complaint in cancer patients and a global problem that requires medical attention, including pain in cervical cancer. Although pharmacotherapy has been used for the treatment of cancer pain, there are still around 40% cannot be treated only with pharmacotherapy. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effects of electroacupuncture (EA) on pain in stage III cervical cancer patients. METHODS: Twenty-eight stage III cervical cancer patients were divided into two groups (14 treatments and 14 controls) with randomized control trial design. The treatment group received EA with a frequency of 2/20-25 Hz at points of ST36, SP6, LI4 and LR3 for 30 minutes, while the control group did not receive EA. Both groups were given paracetamol and codeine at the same dose. Assessment was carried out by measuring pain scale (VAS), plasma β-endorphin levels, and quality of life/QoL (EORTC QLQ-C30) before and after therapy. RESULTS: The average reduction in VAS in the treatment group (2.71 ± 1.14) compared to the control group (0.71 ± 1.33; p < 0.001), average increase in plasma β-endorphin levels in the treatment group (88.57 ± 52.46 pg/ml) compared to the control group (12.86 ± 56.76 pg/ml; p = 0.001), and in QoL, there were significant differences in symptom improvement between the treatment and control groups in the domain of fatigue, pain, insomnia and overall QoL (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Medical therapy combined with EA decreased pain scale, increased plasma β-endorphin levels, and improved the QoL for stage III cervical cancer patients.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes
#3759,Efficacy and safety of acupuncture for painful diabetic neuropathy: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"BACKGROUND: Painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN) is a common chronic neurological complication of diabetes mellitus. Medications are often used to relieve pain, but with significant side effects. Acupuncture is now a component of pragmatic and integrative treatment for PDN. An increasing number of relevant randomized controlled trials have been published in recent years, but a comprehensive meta-analysis has not yet been performed. The aim of this paper is to verify the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture for PDN by meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis (TSA). METHODS: All participants in this study should have had a PDN diagnosis and the trial group was treated with acupuncture. Eight databases, including EMbase, PubMed, Web of science, Cochrane Library, China Biology Medicine disc (CBM), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang and Chongqing VIP (CQVIP) were retrieved from inception to 5 April 2023. Meta-analysis was conducted utilizing RevMan 5.3 and Stata 15.0. TSA was performed to assess the adequacy of sample size for the outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 36 studies, comprising 2,739 PDN patients, were included. Among them, 1,393 patients were assigned to the trial group and 1,346 patients were treated in the control group. Outcomes covers the primary indicator Total effective rate (RR = 1.42, 95%CI [1.34, 1.52], p < 0.00001), with 21 studies reported, Pain intensity (SMD = -1.27, 95%CI [-1.58, -0.95], p < 0.00001), with 23 studies reported, and other outcomes, including motor nerve conduction velocity (MCV; MD = 3.58, 95%CI [2.77, 4.38], p < 0.00001), sensory nerve conduction velocity (SCV; MD = 3.62, 95%CI [2.75, 4.49], p < 0.00001), Depression score (SMD = -1.02, 95%CI [1.58, 0.46]), Toronto clinical scoring system (TCSS; MD = -2.41, 95%CI [-3.37, -1.45], p < 0.00001), Quality of life (SMD = 1.06, 95%CI [0.66, 1.46]), traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) syndrome score (MD = -4.99, 95%CI [-6.79, -3.18], p < 0.00001), suggesting that acupuncture have an ameliorating effect on PDN in various respect. Egger's test revealed publication bias for four outcomes. TSA showed that as for Total effective rate, Pain Intensity, MCV and SCV, the number of included studies was sufficient to support the conclusions. CONCLUSION: Acupuncture demonstrates significant effectiveness in improving PDN outcomes, including Total effective rate, Pain intensity, MCV, SCV, Depression score, TCSS, Quality of life, TCM syndrome score. But the Adverse events rate is no different in trail group and control group. The publication bias presented in Total effective rate, Pain intensity, MCV and SCV can be remedied by Trim and filling method.

#3779,Acupuncture for constipation in Parkinson's disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials,"BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurological disease worldwide, and there is a potential interaction between PD and constipation. PD constipation often causes significant trouble for patients and seriously affects their quality of life. Acupuncture is widely used for treating constipation and has been clinically proven. However, it is unclear whether the current evidence is sufficient to support acupuncture to improve PD constipation. METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, PubMed, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wan Fang Data Knowledge Service Platform, and Chinese Scientific Journal Database (VIP database) for randomized controlled trials from inception through July 1, 2023. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) included acupuncture, sham acupuncture, and medication for PD constipation. Stata 16.0 software and Cochrane RoB2.0 were used for data processing and migration risk analysis. RESULTS: The 11 studies included a total of 960 patients. The results showed that acupuncture or acupuncture combined with conventional treatment seemed to have advantages in improving complete spontaneous bowel movements (WMD: 1.49, 95% CI: 0.86, 2.11; P < .00001), Patient-Assessment of Constipation Quality of Life questionnaire (WMD: -11.83, 95% CI: -15.67, -7.99; P < .00001), the chronic constipation severity scale (CCS) (SMD: -0.99, 95% CI: -1.40, -0.58; P < .01), and c(RRP) (WMD: 2.13, 95% CI: 0.44, 3.82; P < .05). CONCLUSION: The present results show that compared with conventional treatment, acupuncture combined with conventional treatment seems to increase the number of spontaneous defecations in PD patients, improve quality of life, increase rectal resting pressure, and alleviate the severity of chronic constipation. Thus, acupuncture has the potential to treat PD constipation. However, due to the study's limitations, higher-quality RCTs are needed for verification.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#3780,Clinical effectiveness of acupuncture on Parkinson disease: A PRISMA-compliant systematic review and meta-analysis,"BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second-most-common chronic and progressive neurodegenerative disease. The long-term use of levodopa leads to a loss of efficacy and to complications. Therefore, many patients with PD have turned to complementary therapies to help relieve their symptoms. Acupuncture is most commonly used as a complementary therapy in patients with PD. This paper presents a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effects of acupuncture for patients with PD. This study was performed to summarize and evaluate evidence regarding the effectiveness of acupuncture in the relief of PD symptoms. METHODS: Seven databases, namely, MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, the China National Knowledge Infrastructure [CNKI], and three Korean medical databases, were searched from their inception through August 2015 without language restrictions. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included if they contained reports of acupuncture compared with no treatment and conventional treatment alone or acupuncture plus conventional treatment compared with conventional treatment alone for PD symptoms. Assessments were performed with the unified PD rating scales (UPDRS) I, II, III, and IV and the total score, the Webster scale, and effectiveness rating. Methodological quality was assessed using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) scale and the Cochrane risk of bias (ROB). RESULTS: In all, 982 potentially relevant articles were identified; 25 RCTs met our inclusion criterion, 19 of 25 RCTs were high-quality studies (i.e., a score of 6 or higher). The included RCTs showed favorable results for acupuncture plus conventional treatment compared with conventional treatment alone in the UPDRS II, III, and IV and the total score. Acupuncture was effective in relieving PD symptoms compared with no treatment and conventional treatment alone, and acupuncture plus conventional treatment had a more significant effect than conventional treatment alone. CONCLUSIONS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the use of acupuncture for relief of PD symptoms and found that acupuncture has significant positive effects. Acupuncture can be considered as a combination treatment with conventional treatment for patients with PD. Further studies on this topic should be carried out according to rigorous methodological designs in both the East and the West.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#3789,SHORT-TERM EFFECTS OF TRIGGER POINT DRY NEEDLING ON PAIN AND DISABILITY IN SUBJECTS WITH PATELLOFEMORAL PAIN SYNDROME,"BACKGROUND: Patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) is a prevalent knee disorder. A novel yet increasingly popular treatment for PFPS is trigger point dry needling (DN). PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine if DN is more effective at reducing pain and disability than a sham treatment in individuals with PFPS. STUDY DESIGN: Randomized trial. MATERIALS/METHODS: Sixty military health care beneficiaries (36 males) with a clinical diagnosis of PFPS were recruited and completed the study. Subjects underwent a standardized clinical examination and were randomized into a DN or sham treatment group. DN treatment consisted of insertion of an acupuncture-like needle into six sites in the quadriceps femoris muscles of the symptomatic lower extremity based on a palpation examination. The sham grouped received a simulated treatment with a sharp object and needle guide tube without puncturing the skin. Self-reports of pain, disability, and overall status were collected before treatment, immediately after treatment and at 72 hours. Data were analyzed with separate 2x2 repeated measures analysis of variance, with independent variables being Group (DN vs. sham) and Time (pre-treatment vs. immediately post-treatment, and pre-treatment vs. 72 hours). The hypothesis of interest in each case was the Group*Time interaction. The alpha-level was set a priori to .05 using 2-tailed tests. RESULTS: Both groups exhibited a clinically meaningful reduction in pain based on numeric pain rating scale scores immediately post-treatment and at 72 hours, but there was no statistically significant difference between groups (p = 0.219, 0.310). There was no significant difference between groups for any other outcome measures. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that DN treatment is not more effective than a sham DN treatment at reducing short-term pain and disability in individuals with PFPS when used as an isolated treatment approach.

#3798,Auricular acupressure for insomnia in hemodialysis patients: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Patients on maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) frequently complain of insomnia. Poor sleep quality impairs their quality of life and adversely affects long-term outcome. Previously we applied auricular acupressure therapy (AAT) for MHD patients with insomnia and yielded favorable results. AAT probably improves sleep quality by stimulating the vagus nerve and inhibiting sympathetic overactivity. However, the efficacy of AAT for insomnia in this population is still lacking. The proposed randomized controlled trial (RCT) will evaluate the efficacy and safety of AAT for improvement of sleep quality in MHD patients with insomnia. METHODS/DESIGN: The proposed study is a multi-center, double-blind (participants and assessors), parallel-group RCT. A total of 112 participants with insomnia will be recruited from six hemodialysis centers in Guangzhou, China, and randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to receive auricular acupressure on either active points (AA group) or control points (points irrelevant to insomnia management, SAA group). The treatment will last for 8 weeks prior to a follow-up period of 12 weeks. Evaluation by blinded assessors at baseline, at 8 weeks (end of treatment) as well as at 4-week, 8-week and 12-week follow-ups (after intervention) will include Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) scores and average weekly dose of hypnotics. The primary endpoint is clinical response rate (percentage of participants who reach a reduction of PSQI global score ≥ 3 in each group) at 8 weeks from baseline. Secondary endpoints include the changes in PSQI scores over time from baseline, as well as the changes in weekly dose of hypnotics. DISCUSSION: This paper describes the rationale and design of a double-blind RCT that aims to determine the efficacy and safety of AAT for insomnia of hemodialysis patients. If successful, this project will provide evidence of the efficacy and safety of AAT for insomnia of hemodialysis patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov , Identifier: NCT03015766 .

#3803,Should physiotherapists use acupuncture for treating patients with cancer-induced bone pain? A discussion paper,"BACKGROUND: Patients suffering from pain due to bony metastases in cancer represent a challenge to the physiotherapist as part of the multidisciplinary team. Adequate pain relief improves quality of life and functional status, yet conventional analgesia often has undesirable side-effects and non-pharmacological treatments (e.g. some electrotherapies) may be contraindicated in cancer. Acupuncture is a potential treatment for cancer-induced bone pain (CIBP) as it has few side effects and is relatively easy to administer. There is a dearth of research on the use of acupuncture in treating CIBP and some practitioners express fears about treating cancer patients with acupuncture. OBJECTIVES: To discuss the use of acupuncture for CIBP by reviewing the physiological rationale for using acupuncture to treat CIBP and the risks and benefits of using acupuncture in clinical practice. DATA SOURCES: Evidence was identified by searching seven major databases: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, AMED and SPORTDiscus. Evidence was synthesised by the authors to raise issues and discussion points within a narrative review framework. FINDINGS: Available physiological evidence supports potentially efficacious effects of acupuncture for reduction of CIBP. Clinical literature suggests that acupuncture may be effective as an adjunctive treatment for CIBP and that risks are manageable. However, there is a need for well-designed randomised controlled trials to investigate efficacy and effectiveness in patients. CONCLUSIONS: Acupuncture has the potential to provide sustained background analgesia and/or rapid onset analgesia for breakthrough pain if the appropriate points and techniques are used.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#3808,Acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine in the treatment of patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis: a randomized-controlled clinical trial,"BACKGROUND: Patients with allergic rhinitis (AR) increasingly use complementary medicine. The aim of this study was to determine whether traditional Chinese therapy is efficacious in patients suffering from seasonal AR. METHODS: Fifty-two patients between the ages of 20 and 58 who had typical symptoms of seasonal AR were assigned randomly and in a blinded fashion to (i) an active treatment group which received a semi-standardized treatment of acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine, and (ii) a control group which received acupuncture applied to non-acupuncture points in addition to a non-specific Chinese herbal formula. All patients received acupuncture treatment once per week and the respective Chinese herbal formula as a decoction three times daily for a total of 6 weeks. Assessments were performed before, during, and 1 week after treatment. The change in severity of hay fever symptoms was the primary outcome measured on a visual analogue scale (VAS). RESULTS: Compared with patients in the control group, patients in the active treatment group showed a significant after-treatment improvement on the VAS (P = 0.006) and Rhinitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (P = 0.015). Improvement on the Global Assessment of Change Scale was noted in 85% of active treatment group participants vs 40% in the control group (P = 0.048). No differences between the two groups could be detected with the Allergic Rhinitis Symptom Questionnaire. Both treatments were well-tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that traditional Chinese therapy may be an efficacious and safe treatment option for patients with seasonal AR.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes

Our previous pilot study has indicated the potential of acupuncture to improve HRQOL and control cancer-related symptoms burden. This full-scale trial will focus on confirming the effect of acupuncture for patients with gastric cancer. METHODS: A multicenter, open-label, three-arm randomized controlled trial with 249 patients will be conducted in China. Patients will be randomly assigned, in a ratio of 1:1:1, to receive high-dose acupuncture (HA, 7 times each chemo-cycle for 3 cycles), low-dose acupuncture (LA, 3 times each chemo-cycle for 3 cycles), or no acupuncture. The acupoints prescription consisted of bilateral ST36, PC6, SP4, DU20, EX-HN3, and selected Back-shu points. Patients-reported Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Gastric (FACT-Ga) and modified Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (mESAS) during the therapy will be recorded. Area under curve (AUC, 21 days/cycle × 3 cycles) and average trajectory of FACT-Ga and mESAS will be calculated. The primary outcome will be the differences in AUC of the FACT-Ga Trial Outcome Index (TOI) between HA and LA versus control groups.

#3910,Acupuncture for polycystic ovarian syndrome,"BACKGROUND: Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is characterised by the clinical signs of oligo-amenorrhoea, infertility and hirsutism. Conventional treatment of PCOS includes a range of oral pharmacological agents, lifestyle changes and surgical modalities. Beta-endorphin is present in the follicular fluid of both normal and polycystic ovaries. It was demonstrated that the beta-endorphin levels in ovarian follicular fluid of otherwise healthy women who were undergoing ovulation were much higher than the levels measured in plasma. Given that acupuncture impacts on beta-endorphin production, which may affect gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) secretion, it is postulated that acupuncture may have a role in ovulation induction via increased beta-endorphin production effecting GnRH secretion. This is an update of our previous review published in 2016. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture treatment for oligo/anovulatory women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) for both fertility and symptom control. SEARCH METHODS: We identified relevant studies from databases including the Gynaecology and Fertility Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CNKI, CBM and VIP. We also searched trial registries and reference lists from relevant papers. CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CNKI and VIP searches are current to May 2018. CBM database search is to November 2015. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that studied the efficacy of acupuncture treatment for oligo/anovulatory women with PCOS. We excluded quasi- or pseudo-RCTs. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently selected the studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We calculated risk ratios (RR), mean difference (MD), standardised mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Primary outcomes were live birth rate, multiple pregnancy rate and ovulation rate, and secondary outcomes were clinical pregnancy rate, restored regular menstruation period, miscarriage rate and adverse events. We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE methods. MAIN RESULTS: We included eight RCTs with 1546 women. Five RCTs were included in our previous review and three new RCTs were added in this update of the review. They compared true acupuncture versus sham acupuncture (three RCTs), true acupuncture versus relaxation (one RCT), true acupuncture versus clomiphene (one RCT), low-frequency electroacupuncture versus physical exercise or no intervention (one RCT) and true acupuncture versus Diane-35 (two RCTs). Studies that compared true acupuncture versus Diane-35 did not measure fertility outcomes as they were focused on symptom control.Seven of the studies were at high risk of bias in at least one domain.For true acupuncture versus sham acupuncture, we could not exclude clinically relevant differences in live birth (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.24; 1 RCT, 926 women; low-quality evidence); multiple pregnancy rate (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.33 to 2.45; 1 RCT, 926 women; low-quality evidence); ovulation rate (SMD 0.02, 95% CI -0.15 to 0.19, I(2) = 0%; 2 RCTs, 1010 women; low-quality evidence); clinical pregnancy rate (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.29; I(2) = 0%; 3 RCTs, 1117 women; low-quality evidence) and miscarriage rate (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.56; 1 RCT, 926 women; low-quality evidence).Number of intermenstrual days may have improved in participants receiving true acupuncture compared to sham acupuncture (MD -312.09 days, 95% CI -344.59 to -279.59; 1 RCT, 141 women; low-quality evidence).True acupuncture probably worsens adverse events compared to sham acupuncture (RR 1.16, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.31; I(2) = 0%; 3 RCTs, 1230 women; moderate-quality evidence).No studies reported data on live birth rate and multiple pregnancy rate for the other comparisons: physical exercise or no intervention, relaxation and clomiphene. Studies including Diane-35 did not measure fertility outcomes.We were uncertain whether acupuncture improved ovulation rate (measured by ultrasound three months post treatment) compared to relaxation (MD 0.35, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.56; 1 RCT, 28 women; very low-quality evidence) or Diane-35 (RR 1.45, 95% CI 0.87 to 2.42; 1 RCT, 58 women; very low-quality evidence).Overall evidence ranged from very low quality to moderate quality. The main limitations were failure to report important clinical outcomes and very serious imprecision. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: For true acupuncture versus sham acupuncture we cannot exclude clinically relevant differences in live birth rate, multiple pregnancy rate, ovulation rate, clinical pregnancy rate or miscarriage. Number of intermenstrual days may improve in participants receiving true acupuncture compared to sham acupuncture. True acupuncture probably worsens adverse events compared to sham acupuncture.No studies reported data on live birth rate and multiple pregnancy rate for the other comparisons: physical exercise or no intervention, relaxation and clomiphene. Studies including Diane-35 did not measure fertility outcomes as the women in these trials did not seek fertility.We are uncertain whether acupuncture improves ovulation rate (measured by ultrasound three months post treatment) compared to relaxation or Diane-35. The other comparisons did not report on this outcome.Adverse events were recorded in the acupuncture group for the comparisons physical exercise or no intervention, clomiphene and Diane-35. These included dizziness, nausea and subcutaneous haematoma. Evidence was very low quality with very wide CIs and very low event rates.There are only a limited number of RCTs in this area, limiting our ability to determine effectiveness of acupuncture for PCOS.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#3912,Effect of auriculotherapy on menstrual irregularities in single girls with polycystic ovarian syndrome and aged 18-35 years in Isfahan in 2012,"BACKGROUND: Polycystic ovarian syndrome is one of the most common endocrine disorders with a prevalence of 5-10% in women. This syndrome is one of the major causes for menstrual disorders and is treated by medicational and non-medicational methods. This study aimed to define the effect of auriculotherapy on menstruation disorders in girls with polycystic ovarian syndrome. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a clinical trial conducted on 60 single girls aged 18-35 years with clinical, laboratory, and sonography signs. The subjects were randomly assigned to two groups of auriculotherapy and medication, which underwent treatment for 2 and 3 months, respectively. Clinical signs were investigated in three steps in both groups. Data were collected through observation, laboratory tests, and sonography, and were analyzed by SPSS version 15. RESULTS: In 60 subjects, Chi-square test showed a significant difference in menstruation disorders in both groups 1 month after the start of intervention (P = 0.001); but 2 months after the start of intervention (P = 0.11) and immediately after the end of the intervention (P = 0.16), the difference was not significant. Three months after the end of the intervention, this variable showed a significant difference (P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Medicational treatment and auriculotherapy are both effective on menstruation disorders, but auriculotherapy is more effective on reduction of menstruation disorders, compared to medicational therapy.",No,No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No
#3937,Acupuncture for the Postcholecystectomy Syndrome: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"BACKGROUND: Postcholecystectomy syndrome (PCS) has become a common postoperative syndrome that requires systematic and comprehensive therapy to achieve adequate clinical control. Acupuncture and related therapies have shown clinical effects for PCS in many studies. However, systematic reviews/meta-analyses (SRs/MAs) for them are lacking. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of acupuncture in the treatment of PCS using randomized controlled trials (RCTs). METHODS: Potentially eligible studies were searched in the following electronic databases up to 1 February 2020: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science (WoS), Chinese databases (Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), WanFang Database (WF), and China Science and Technology Journal Database (VIP)), and other sources (WHO ICTRP, ChiCTR, Clinical Trials, and Grey Literature Database). The RevMan 5.3 was employed for analyses. The Cochrane Collaboration' risk of bias tool was used to assess the risk of bias (ROB). The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to assess the quality of the evidence. RESULTS: A total of 14 RCTs with 1593 participants were included in this SR. MA showed that acupuncture in combination with conventional medicine (CM) did not show statistical differences in reduction in pain. However, acupuncture in combination with CM significantly reduced the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) (RR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.55-0.92) and improved gastrointestinal function recovery compared to the CM group. Acupuncture combined with traditional Chinese medicine and CM, and acupuncture as monotherapy may improve gastrointestinal function recovery with acceptable adverse events. CONCLUSION: Acupuncture may be an effective and safe treatment for PCS. However, this study lacks conclusive evidence due to poor quality evidence, limited data, and clinical heterogeneity of acupuncture methods in the included studies.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#3938,Acupuncture for the postcholecystectomy syndrome: Protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis,"BACKGROUND: Postcholecystectomy syndrome (PCS) is a term used to describe the persistence of biliary colic or right upper quadrant abdominal pain with a variety of postoperative gastrointestinal symptoms. Acupuncture and related treatments have shown clinical effects for PCS in many studies. But the systematic reviews and meta-analyses for them are lacking. We aim to evaluate the efficacy and safety of acupuncture on the treatment of PCS.

#3948,Acupuncture (superficial dry-needling) as a treatment for chronic postherpetic neuralgia - a randomized clinical trial,"BACKGROUND: Postherpetic neuralgia is a painful condition where finding sufficient treatment poses a great challenge. Acupuncture is often used as an alternative treatment for these pains, yet no randomized trials, using a sham-placebo have been performed to confirm its effect. Our objective was to investigate the efficacy of acupuncture compared to sham-acupuncture when treating chronic postherpetic dermal pain. METHODS: We performed a sham-controlled double-blinded randomized clinical trial (RCT) with two arms. The intervention group received superficial dry-needling, and the control group received sham acupuncture using blunted needles. Twenty-six patients received two treatments. They filled out questionnaires at baseline and 1 month after treatment: (1) average and maximum pain (Numeric Rating Scale), (2) neuropathic pain (Neuropathic Pain Scale Inventory) and (3) Quality of Life (QoL) (Short-form 36). RESULTS: Thirteen patients were allocated to the intervention group and 15 to the control group. We did not detect any significant changes in levels of pain and neuropathic pain. One QoL parameter, regarding emotional problems, reached a level of statistical significance. The sham-blinding was successful. This is the first RCT on the effect of acupuncture (superficial dry-needling) on postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), using a sham procedure as control. We observed no significant changes or tendencies in the measured levels of pain. One QoL parameter had significant improvement in the intervention group compared to the control group. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, acupuncture was not superior to treatment with sham acupuncture. Though individual patients may experience some pain relief from acupuncture, our results do not support the routine use of this type of acupuncture to treat PHN.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes
#3960,Acupuncture for postoperative delirium (POD): A systematic review and meta-analysis protocol,"BACKGROUND: Postoperative delirium (POD) is a form of delirium that is newly diagnosed after a surgical procedure.

#3961,Transcutaneous Electrical Acupoint Stimulation Combined With Auricular Acupressure Reduces Postoperative Delirium Among Elderly Patients Following Major Abdominal Surgery: A Randomized Clinical Trial,"BACKGROUND: Postoperative delirium is common in elderly patients following major surgery. This study aimed to assess the effect of transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation combined with auricular acupressure on the incidence of postoperative delirium among older patients undergoing major abdominal surgery. METHODS: In this single-center, randomized controlled clinical trial, 210 patients aged 65 years or older undergoing major abdominal surgery were randomized to receive either intervention treatment (transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation started at 30 min before anesthesia until the end of the surgery, followed by intermittent auricular acupressure in the first three postoperative days; n = 105) or standard care (n = 105). The primary outcome was the incidence of delirium at the first seven postoperative days or until hospitalization depended on which came first. Secondary outcomes included delirium severity, opioid consumption, postoperative pain score, sleep quality, length of postoperative hospital stay, and postoperative 30-day complications. Enrollment was from April 2019 to March 2020, with follow-up ending in April 2020. RESULTS: All of the 210 randomized patients [median age, 69.5 years, 142 (67.6%) male] completed the trial. The incidence of postoperative delirium was significantly reduced in patients received intervention treatment (19/105 (18.1%) vs. 8/105 (7.6%), difference, -10.5% [95% CI, -1.5% to -19.4%]; hazard ratio, 0.41 [95% CI, 0.18 to 0.95]; P= 0.023). Patients in the control group had a higher postoperative Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale (4 vs. 3; difference, -1; 95% CI, -1 to 0; P = 0.014) and a greater increase in Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score from baseline to postoperative day three (2.5 vs. 2.0; difference, -1; 95% CI, -2 to -1; P < 0.001) than patients in the intervention group. No significant difference was observed as of other secondary outcomes. CONCLUSION: In elderly patients undergoing major abdominal surgery, transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation combined with auricular acupressure reduced the incidence of postoperative in-hospital delirium compared with standard care. A multicenter, randomized clinical trial with a larger sample size is necessary to verify these findings.

#3968,Perioperative transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation for improving postoperative gastrointestinal function: A randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Postoperative gastrointestinal dysfunction (PGD) is one of the most common complications in patients undergoing major abdominal surgery. Acupuncture has been used widely in gastrointestinal diseases due to its effectiveness and minimally invasive nature. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the efficacy of using transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation (TEAS) during the surgery and postoperative recovery in patients with gastric and colorectal surgery for improving postoperative gastrointestinal function. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS AND INTERVENTIONS: A total of 280 patients undergoing abdominal surgery were stratified by type of surgery (i.e., gastric or colorectal surgery) and randomly allocated into the TEAS group (group T) or the sham group (group S). Patients in group T received TEAS at LI4, PC6, ST36 and ST37. Patients in group S received pseudo-TEAS at sham acupoints. The stimulation was given from 30 min before anesthesia until the end of surgery. The same treatment was performed at 9 am on the 1st, 2nd and 3rd days after surgery, until the recovery of flatus in patients. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the time to the first bowel motion, as detected by auscultation. The secondary outcomes included the first flatus and ambulation time, changes of perioperative substance P (SP), incidence of PGD, postoperative pain, postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) and some economic indicators. RESULTS: The time to first bowel motion, first flatus and first ambulation in group T was much shorter than that in group S (P < 0.01). In patients undergoing colorectal surgery, the concentration of SP was lower in group T than in group S on the third day after the operation (P < 0.05). The average incidence of PGD in all patients was 25%, and the frequency of PGD was significantly lower in group T than in group S (18.6% vs. 31.4%, respectively; P < 0.05). TEAS treatment (odds ratio = 0.498; 95% confidence interval: 0.232-0.786) and type of surgery were relevant factors for the development of PGD. Postoperative pain score and PONV occurrence were significantly lower in group T (P < 0.01). Postoperative hospitalization days and the resulting cost to patients were greatly reduced in the TEAS group (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Perioperative TEAS was able to promote the recovery of postoperative gastrointestinal function, reduce the incidence of PGD and PONV. The concentration of SP was decreased by TEAS treatment, which indicates that the brain-gut axis may play a role in how TEAS regulates gastrointestinal function.

#3972,Effect of intradermal needle therapy at combined acupoints on patients' gastrointestinal function following surgery for gastrointestinal tumors,"BACKGROUND: Postoperative gastrointestinal function recovery is critical for rapid rehabilitation of patients with gastrointestinal tumors. Traditional Chinese medicine offers considerable advantages for gastrointestinal disease treatment. However, no study has reported the clinical efficacy of intradermal needle therapy (INT) at the Yuan-source, Luo-connecting, and He-sea points of the corresponding meridian for gastrointestinal function in patients following surgery for gastrointestinal tumors. AIM: To investigate the effect of INT at combined acupoints on patients' gastrointestinal function following surgery for gastrointestinal tumors. METHODS: This randomized controlled trial was conducted at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University on patients with diagnosed gastrointestinal cancer, no distant metastases or organ failure, and hospitalized for elective radical tumor resection, who did not receive preoperative radiotherapy or chemotherapy. Participants were randomly allocated to either the intervention (n = 32) or the control (n = 32) group. Participants in the control group received enhanced recovery care, while those in the intervention group received enhanced recovery care combined with INT at the Yuan-source, Luo-connecting, and He-sea points. After surgery, INT was performed immediately upon the patient's return to the ward, and continued for seven consecutive days. The independent samples t-test, chi-square test, and generalized estimating equations were used for data analysis. RESULTS: The participants' ages ranged from 40 to 80 years (average 63 ± 10.1 years). Most participants underwent surgery for either gastric (43.8%) or colon cancer (39.1%) and had adenocarcinoma (87.5%). Significant differences were noted in time to first postoperative flatus passage (66 ± 27 h vs 103 ± 41 h, P < 0.001), time to first defecation (106 ± 44 h vs 153 ± 50 h, P < 0.001), and time to first oral feeding (73 ± 30 h vs 115 ± 38 h, P < 0.001) between the intervention and control groups. Gastrointestinal symptoms, including abdominal distension, nausea, and fatigue 48 h and 72 h after surgery, were significantly alleviated in the intervention group compared with that observed in the control group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: INT at the Yuan-source, Luo-connecting, and He-sea points can promote recovery of gastrointestinal function and ease gastrointestinal symptoms in patients following surgical resection of gastrointestinal tumors.",No,No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No
#3990,Comparison of laser acupuncture and metoclopramide in PONV prevention in children,"BACKGROUND: Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) are frequent side effects of general anesthesia in children. The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of laser acupuncture with metoclopramide in prevention of PONV in children after sevoflurane anesthesia. METHODS: A total of 120 children ASA I and II, scheduled for hernia repair, circumcision or orchidopexy were randomly assigned into three groups: group I, received laser acupuncture on P6 point and saline infusion; group II, metoclopramide 0.1 mg.kg(-1) i.v. and sham laser; group III had sham laser and saline infusion. Anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane and N(2)O/O(2). Patients were monitored for any symptoms of retching and vomiting at 2, 6 and 24 h postoperatively. RESULTS: The incidence of vomiting was higher in the control group in the first 2 h postoperatively (P < 0.001), compared with the other groups. There was no statistically significant difference between acupuncture and metoclopramide groups in occurrence and timing of vomiting (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Laser acupuncture is equally effective as metoclopramide in preventing PONV in children.",No,No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No
#3991,Transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation for preventing postoperative nausea and vomiting after laparoscopic surgery: A meta-analysis,"BACKGROUND: Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is a common adverse event after general surgery. This study aimed to examine the effectiveness and safety of transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation (TEAS) for the prevention of nausea and vomiting after laparoscopic surgery. METHOD: The Cochrane Library, Pubmed, Embase, and Web of Science databases were accessed from inception to 23 January 2024. The incidence of PONV was the primary outcome measure. The required information size (RIS) of each outcome was estimated by Trial sequential analysis (TSA). The RoB 2.0 tool was used to assess the risk of bias and GRADE to assess the quality of evidence. RESULTS: Seventeen RCTs including 3698 participants were included. In comparison to the control group, TEAS reduced the incidence of PONV (13 trials, n = 3310; RR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.46-0.67; I(2) = 64%; p < 0.01; RIS = 1100), with the level of evidence graded as low. TEAS reduced the incidence of PON (9 trials, n = 2762; RR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.52-0.79; I(2) = 57%, p < 0.01; RIS = 1595), and was also associated with a lower incidence of POV (9 trials, n = 2797; RR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.45-0.63; I(2) = 0%, p < 0.01; RIS = 773). CONCLUSION: The current meta-analysis and TSA provide reliable evidence that TEAS is an effective and safe method to prevent PONV. It may reduce the workload of nursing professionals, alleviate emotional stress, and decrease exposure risk. Adverse events related to TEAS were mild.

#3997,Dexamethasone alone vs in combination with transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation or tropisetron for prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting in gynaecological patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery,"BACKGROUND: Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is commonly reported after surgery and anaesthesia. We compared the effects of combinations of electrical acupoint stimulation or tropisetron with dexamethasone with the effects of dexamethasone alone, for inhibition of PONV in gynaecological patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery. METHODS: We randomized 157 patients undergoing elective gynaecological laparoscopic surgery under general anaesthesia into the following three groups: acupoint stimulation+dexamethasone (Group Acu, n=53), tropisetron+dexamethasone (Group Trp, n=53), and dexamethasone alone (Group Dxm, n=51). The incidence of nausea, vomiting, and need for rescue antiemetics was recorded 2, 6, 24, and 48 h after surgery. RESULTS: We found significant differences in the incidence of PONV during 24 h after surgery between the combination therapy groups and the dexamethasone-alone group (P=0.021). In the first 24 h, 28% of patients in Group Acu, 26% of patients in Group Trp, and 50% of patients in Group Dxm experienced nausea, vomiting, or both. The incidence of 24 h PONV in Group Acu was significantly lower than that in Group Dxm (P=0.048; odds ratio 0.389; 95% CI 0.170-0.891). The incidence of 24 h PONV in Group Trp was also significantly lower than that in Group Dxm (P=0.042; odds ratio 0.359; 95% CI 0.157-0.819). There was no significant difference between Group Acu and Group Trp (P=0.857). The need for antiemetic rescue medication was similar in the three groups. All groups expressed similar patient satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: Combined with dexamethasone, electrical acupoint stimulation or tropisetron is more effective in PONV prophylaxis than dexamethasone alone in gynaecological patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery.

#4015,"Acupuncture in posttonsillectomy pain : A prospective, double-blinded, randomized, controlled trial","BACKGROUND: Postoperative swallowing pain is one of the most unpleasant after-effects of tonsillectomy. During recent years, the demand for alternatives to drug-based pain therapy has continued to grow, although the topic has received little research attention until now. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 46 patients were randomized into verum acupuncture, control acupuncture, and drug-based treatment groups. All patients received nonsteroidal antirheumatic drugs (NSAIDs). One hour after drug intake, the verum group also received acupuncture according to classical acupuncture rules (S34, S44 and PC5). The control group had acupuncture needles placed at nonspecific acupuncture points in the midaxillary line. Acupuncture was performed by a blinded acupuncturist, who had learnt exclusively these techniques in the run up to the study. Patients were asked to evaluate their pain before, and at intervals of 20 min, 1 h, 2 h, and 3 h after drug intake/acupuncture treatment using a visual analog scale (VAS). RESULTS: The analgesic effect of acupuncture was significant up to 3 hours in the verum group (p < 0.05). The analgesic effect in the control acupuncture group was significant for up to 1 h after acupuncture (p < 0.05). With reference to the time point before acupuncture, the differences between both acupuncture groups and the drug group were significant (p < 0.01) over the whole time. CONCLUSION: Acupuncture is an effective complement to NSAIDs in the treatment of posttonsillectomy pain. Particularly patients with allergies, drug intolerance, or reduced response to the commonly administered drugs may benefit from acupuncture.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes
#4036,Effects of moxibustion on cognition and activities of daily living in post-stroke cognitive impairment: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials,"BACKGROUND: Post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) imposes a huge burden on patients and society as a whole; however, unequivocally effective treatments for PSCI are still lacking. Therefore, the exploration of effective and safe non-pharmacological treatment modalities for PSCI is a key imperative. Moxibustion has been widely used for cognitive rehabilitation; however, there is a paucity of systematic reviews of the available evidence. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that investigated the effectiveness of moxibustion for treatment of PSCI to provide evidence base for the treatment of PSCI with moxibustion. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of moxibustion in improving cognitive function and activities of daily living (ADLs) in patients with PSCI. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with a clinical diagnosis of PSCI. REVIEW METHODS: Relevant studies published in English or Chinese were retrieved from ten databases until December 2021. RCTs that assessed the efficacy of moxibustion on cognitive functioning and ADL in patients with PSCI were included. Two reviewers independently identified the trials and extracted the data. Risk-of-bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. Cochrane's Review Manager (RevMan 5.4) software was used for the meta-analysis. RESULTS: Eighteen RCTs (1290 participants) qualified the inclusion criteria and were included. Compared with the control group, the addition of moxibustion significantly improved the cognitive function, evaluated using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) [pooled mean difference (MD): 2.27, 95% CI: 1.98, 2.55, I(2)  = 22%]. The pooled MD of Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score was 1.85 (95% CI: 1.56, 2.15, I(2)  = 26%), and the pooled odds ratios (OR) total effective rate was 4.74 (95% CI: 2.55, 8.80, I(2)  = 0%) (p < 0.05 for all). Moxibustion also significantly improved ADL, assessed using Modified Barthel Index (MBI) (pooled MD = 4.10, 95% CI: 2.10 to 6.10, I(2)  = 0%) and Barthel Index (pooled MD: 8.63, 95% CI: 7.47, 9.79, I(2)  = 5%) (p < 0.05 for all). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with control group, the addition of moxibustion significantly improved the cognition and ADL of patients with PSCI.

It can lower the quality of life and increase the recurrence and mortality. Pharmacological agents have been shown to treat PSD. However, the benefits of pharmacotherapy are debatable and the side-effects are significant. More and more clinical trials suggest that acupuncture plays an important role in patients with PSD. The primary purposes of the study are to conduct a Bayesian analysis of randomized trials to determine the effect of acupuncture and investigate the effect of several acupuncture therapies on PSD. METHODS: We will retrieve articles from 5 English databases [PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry (TCTRP)] and 4 Chinese databases [Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Chinese VIP Information, Wanfang Database, and Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM)]. The publication period will be from inception to January 2019. All randomized controlled trials that evaluate the safety and efficacy of acupuncture on PSD will be included. The primary outcomes will be the change in the degree of depression as measured by the Hamilton Depression Scale and Beck Depression Inventory. Two reviewers will separately extract the data and assess the risk of bias by using the Cochrane Collaboration's risk of bias tool. Bayesian analysis will be conducted to pool the effects of several acupunctures. The ranking probabilities for several acupunctures (simple acupuncture, fire needle, warm acupuncture, auriculo-acupuncture, or electroacupuncture) will be estimated by the surface under the cumulative ranking curve. RESULT: This study will provide reliable evidence for acupuncture on PSD. CONCLUSION: The results of this review will introduce a safe and effective treatment and provide reliable evidence to evaluate the effectiveness of several acupuncture therapies on PSD.

#4123,"Treatments of pelvic girdle pain in pregnant women: adverse effects of standard treatment, acupuncture and stabilising exercises on the pregnancy, mother, delivery and the fetus/neonate","BACKGROUND: Previous publications indicate that acupuncture is efficient for the treatment of pelvic girdle pain, PGP, in pregnant women. However, the use of acupuncture for PGP is rare due to insufficient documentation of adverse effects of this treatment in this specific condition. The aim of the present work was to assess adverse effects of acupuncture on the pregnancy, mother, delivery and the fetus/neonate in comparison with women that received stabilising exercises as adjunct to standard treatment or standard treatment alone. METHODS: In all, 386 women with PGP entered this controlled, single-blind trial. They were randomly assigned to standard treatment plus acupuncture (n = 125), standard treatment plus specific stabilising exercises (n = 131) or to standard treatment alone (n = 130) for 6 weeks. Acupuncture that may be considered strong was used and treatment was started as early as in the second trimester of pregnancy. Adverse effects were recorded during treatment and throughout the pregnancy. Influence on the fetus was measured with cardiotocography (CTG) before-during and after 43 acupuncture sessions in 43 women. A standardised computerized method to analyze the CTG reading numerically (Oxford 8000, Oxford, England) was used. After treatment, the women rated their overall experience of the treatment and listed adverse events if any in a questionnaire. Data of analgesia and oxytocin augmentation during labour, duration of labour, frequency of preterm birth, operative delivery, Apgar score, cord-blood gas/acid base balance and birth weight were also recorded. RESULTS: There were no serious adverse events after any of the treatments. Minor adverse events were common in the acupuncture group but women rated acupuncture favourably even despite this. The computerized or visually assessed CTG analyses of antenatal recordings in connection with acupuncture were all normal. CONCLUSION: This study shows that acupuncture administered with a stimulation that may be considered strong led to minor adverse complaints from the mothers but had no observable severe adverse influences on the pregnancy, mother, delivery or the fetus/neonate.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes
#4126,"The efficacy and safety study of electro-acupuncture for severe chronic functional constipation: study protocol for a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial","BACKGROUND: Previous research has shown that electro-acupuncture (EA) may be effective for functional constipation. We report a protocol for a randomized controlled trial using EA to confirm the efficacy and safety for severe chronic functional constipation. METHODS/DESIGN: This is a randomized, controlled trial.

#4135,Altered functional brain activity in first-episode major depressive disorder treated with electro-acupuncture: A resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging study,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies have found electroacupuncture could improve the clinical symptoms of first-episode major depressive disorder (MDD), but the exact neural mechanism of action needs to be further elucidated. METHODS: Twenty-eight first-episode MDD patients were randomly divided into 14 electro-acupuncture stimulation (EAS) groups and 14 sham-acupuncture stimulation (SAS) groups, and clinical symptoms were assessed and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans were done in both groups. Amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) was used to observe the changes between the pre-treatment and post-treatment in the two groups, and the altered brain areas were selected as region of interest (ROI) to observe the FC changes. Meanwhile, the correlation between the altered clinical symptoms and the altered ALFF and FC of brain regions in the two groups was analyzed. RESULTS: The EAS significantly decreased the HAMD-24 and HAMA-14 scores of MDD than SAS group. The imaging results revealed that both groups were able to increase the ALFF of the left middle temporal gyrus and the left cerebellar posterior lobe. When using the left middle temporal gyrus and the left posterior cerebellar lobe as ROIs, EAS group increased the FC between the left middle temporal gyrus with the left superior frontal gyrus, the left middle frontal gyrus, and the left hippocampus, and decreased the FC between the left posterior cerebellar lobe and the left calcarine gyrus, while SAS group only increased the FC between the left middle temporal gyrus with the left superior frontal gyrus. The alternations in clinical symptoms after EAS treatment were positively correlated with the altered ALFF values in the left middle temporal gyrus and the altered FC values in the left middle temporal gyrus and the left middle frontal gyrus. CONCLUSION: EA demonstrates modulation of functional activity in the default mode network (DMN), sensorimotor network (SMN), cognitive control network (CCN), limbic system, and visual network (VN) for the treatment of the first-episode MDD. Our findings contribute to the neuroimaging evidence for the efficacy of EAS.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes
#4153,Acupuncture for dry eye: a multicentre randomised controlled trial with active comparison intervention (artificial tear drop) using a mixed method approach protocol,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies of acupuncture show favourable results for both subjective and objective outcomes of dry eye. However, firm conclusions could not be drawn from these studies because the quality of the trials was too low to establish concrete evidence. Therefore, this study was designed both to avoid the flaws of the existing trials and to assess the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and qualitative characteristics of acupuncture treatment for dry eye. METHODS/DESIGN: One hundred fifty participants with dry eye will be recruited into three independent hospitals from different areas: Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine, DongGuk University Ilsan Oriental Hospital and Dongshin University Gwangju Oriental Hospital. The number of participants required was calculated from the data of a previous, relevant study. These patients will be randomly allocated into acupuncture treatment or artificial tear groups. Either 17 acupuncture points (bilateral BL2, GB14, TE 23, Ex1, ST1, GB20, LI4, LI11 and single GV23) will be used 3 times a week or disposable artificial tear drops (Refresh Plus®, ALLERGAN) will be provided for use at least once a day for 4 weeks. The ocular surface disease index (OSDI), tear film break-up time (TFBUT), Schirmer I test, visual analogue scale (VAS) for self-assessment of ocular discomfort, general assessment (by both acupuncture practitioners and participants) and quality of life (QOL) through the Measure Yourself Medical Outcome Profile-2 (MYMOP-2) will be assessed for approximately 3-months for each study participant.

#4182,Acupuncture for dysmenorrhoea,"BACKGROUND: Primary dysmenorrhoea is the most common form of period pain and affects up to three-quarters of women at some stage of their reproductive life. Primary dysmenorrhoea is pain in the absence of any organic cause and is characterised by cramping pain in the lower abdomen, starting within the first eight to 72 hours of menstruation.This review examines the currently available evidence supporting the use of acupuncture (stimulation of points on the body using needles) and acupressure (stimulation of points on the body using pressure) to treat primary dysmenorrhoea. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture and acupressure in the treatment of primary dysmenorrhoea when compared with a placebo, no treatment, or conventional medical treatment. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the following databases: the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Trials Register (to September 2015), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (the Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL and Chinese databases including Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), VIP database and registers of ongoing trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included all published and unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing acupuncture with sham acupuncture or placebo control, usual care, pharmacological treatment or no treatment. We included the following modes of treatment: acupuncture, electro-acupuncture, and acupressure. Participants were women of reproductive age with primary dysmenorrhoea during the majority of the menstrual cycles or for three consecutive menstrual cycles, and moderate to severe symptoms. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We calculated odds ratios (ORs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) or standardised mean differences (SMDs) for continuous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We pooled the data where appropriate. Our primary outcomes was pain. Secondary outcomes included menstrual symptoms, quality of life, and adverse effects. MAIN RESULTS: We included 42 RCTs (4640 women). Acupuncture or acupressure was compared with a sham/placebo group, medication, no treatment or other treatment. Many of the continuous data were not suitable for calculation of means, mainly due to evidence of skew.1. Acupuncture studies Acupuncture versus sham or placebo control (6 RCTs)Findings were inconsistent and inconclusive. However, the only study in the review that was at low risk of bias in all domains found no evidence of a difference between the groups at three, six or 12 months. The overall quality of the evidence was low. No studies reported adverse events. Acupuncture versus NSAIDs Seven studies reported visual analogue scale (VAS) pain scores, but were unsuitable for pooling due to extreme heterogeneity (I² = 94%). In all studies the scores were lower in the acupuncture group, with the mean difference varying across studies from 0.64 to 4 points on a VAS 0 - 10 scale (low-quality evidence). Four RCTs reported rates of pain relief, and found a benefit for the acupuncture group (OR 4.99, 95% CI 2.82 to 8.82, 352 women, I² = 0%, low-quality evidence). Adverse events were less common in the acupuncture group (OR 0.10, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.44, 4 RCTs, 239 women, 4 trials, I² = 15%, low-quality evidence). Acupuncture versus no treatment Data were unsuitable for analysis, but pain scores were lower in the acupuncture group in all six studies reporting this outcome. The quality of the evidence was low. No studies reported adverse events.2. Acupressure studiesNo studies of acupressure reported adverse events. Acupressure versus sham or placebo controlData were unsuitable for pooling, but two studies reported a mean benefit of one to three points on a 0 - 10 VAS pain scale. Another four studies reported data unsuitable for analysis: all found that pain scores were lower in the acupuncture group. No studies reported adverse events. The quality of the evidence was low. Acupressure versus NSAIDsOne study reported this outcome, using a 0 - 3 pain scale. The score was higher (indicating more pain) in the acupressure group (MD 0.39 points, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.57, 136 women, very low-quality evidence). Acupressure versus no treatmentThere was no clear evidence of a difference between the groups on a VAS 0 - 10 pain scale (MD -0.96 points, 95% CI -2.54 to 0.62, 2 trials, 140 women, I² = 83%, very low-quality evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient evidence to demonstrate whether or not acupuncture or acupressure are effective in treating primary dysmenorrhoea, and for most comparisons no data were available on adverse events. The quality of the evidence was low or very low for all comparisons. The main limitations were risk of bias, poor reporting, inconsistency and risk of publication bias.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#4193,Efficacy and safety of acupuncture combined with Chinese herbal medicine in the treatment of primary liver cancer: A protocol for systematic review and meta-analysis,"BACKGROUND: Primary liver cancer (PLC) is a common cancer, and its morbidity and mortality are ranked 6th and 3rd in the world for malignant tumors, respectively. And this number is still on the rise, seriously endangering people's health. In recent years, acupuncture combined with Chinese herbal medicine have been widely used in the treatment of PLC, and there are few restrictions. However, we have not found a meta-analysis of their synergistic effects. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis will evaluate the efficacy and acupuncture combined with Chinese herbal medicine in the treatment of primary liver cancer. METHOD: We will search the following databases from inception up to August 20, 2021: PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, AMED, Cochrane Library, CNKI, VIP, CBM, and Wanfang. There will be no restrictions regarding publication date or language. We will apply a combination of medical keywords and words, including ""acupuncture,"" ""Chinese herbal medicine"" and ""primary liver cancer"". Additionally, we will manually search all reference lists from relevant systematic reviews to find other eligible studies. We will use the random effects model in REVMAN v5.3 for meta-analysis. The study for acupuncture combined with Chinese herbal medicine in the treatment of PLC was a randomized controlled study. Two researchers will independently review the research selection, data extraction, and research quality assessments. Finally, we will observe the outcome measures. RESULTS: This study will provide evidence-based medical evidence for the treatment of PLC with a combination of acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine, and provide new ideas and methods for the treatment of PLC.Registration number: INPLASY202180103.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#4232,The efficacy and safety of acupuncture for Ramsay Hunt syndrome: A protocol for systematic review,"BACKGROUND: Ramsay Hunt syndrome (RHS), also known as Hunt syndrome, is caused by varicella-zoster virus infection. The virus often invades the facial nerve geniculate ganglion to cause peripheral facial paralysis, accompanied by severe ear pain, auricular herpes zoster, tinnitus, deafness, vertigo, and other inner ear neurologic symptoms. The acupuncture has a long history as a traditional treatment of traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of Hunt syndrome, with few adverse events and low cost. However, there are few evidences for the efficacy and safety of acupuncture for Hunt syndrome. Hence, we plan this systematic review and meta-analysis protocol to evaluate the efficacy and safety of acupuncture for Hunt syndrome. METHODS: Four English databases will be searched from their inception to February 2019, including Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase, OVID, and 4 Chinese databases, including Chinese Biomedical Literature Database [CBM], China National Knowledge Infrastructure [CNKI], CQVIP, and Wanfang. No restriction was imposed for language or publication period. Randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) compared any form of acupuncture with/without additional treatment against sham or no treatment or same additional treatment. Data will be extracted and evaluated by 2 reviewers independently. RevMan 5.3 software will be used for data analysis when a meta-analysis is allowed. RESULTS: This systematic review and meta-analysis will provide an evidence of acupuncture for RHS. CONCLUSION: This study will determine whether acupuncture is an effective and safe intervention for RHS. PROSPERO registration number: CRD 42019118283.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#4234,Acupuncture in sham device controlled trials may not be as effective as acupuncture in the real world: a preliminary network meta-analysis of studies of acupuncture for hot flashes in menopausal women,"BACKGROUND: Randomised controlled trials of acupuncture performed using sham interventions to control for the placebo effect have mostly used two types of sham techniques: techniques with minimal insertion of acupuncture needles with no additional stimulation (shallow needling control) and techniques with sham acupuncture devices that do not penetrate the skin (sham device control). To achieve successful blinding, sham device controlled acupuncture trials also use the acupuncture base unit in the verum acupuncture group, but in the shallow needling control trials this is not necessary for the verum acupuncture treatment. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we analysed the estimated comparative effectiveness of these two verum acupuncture modalities in studies of acupuncture for menopausal hot flashes that used two types of sham control treatments. METHODS: We conducted a network meta-analysis that included randomised controlled trials of acupuncture for hot flashes. Electronic databases, including Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library and AMED, were searched through March 2017. Data were extracted using a predefined data extraction tool by two independent reviewers. The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomised controlled trials. A five-node network meta-analysis was conducted based on the frequentist framework. RESULTS: Eight studies were included in this review. From the network meta-analysis, we found that verum acupuncture in the shallow needling controlled trials was more effective than verum acupuncture in the sham device controlled trials (SMD -7.27, 95% CI-9.11 to -5.43). Significant heterogeneity and inconsistency were not observed among the included studies or the comparisons. CONCLUSIONS: From this preliminary analysis, we found that different types of verum acupuncture may have different effect sizes with respect to the severity of menopausal hot flashes.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#4238,CME Article: Perceptions of Acupuncture and Acupressure by Anesthesia Providers: A Quantitative Descriptive Study,"Background: Randomized controlled trials show that acupuncture and acupressure support anesthesia management by decreasing anxiety, opioid requirements, and treating post-operative nausea and vomiting. Acupuncture and acupressure have demonstrated clinical usefulness but have not yet diffused into mainstream anesthesia practice. To determine why, this study assessed U.S. anesthesia provider's perceptions of acupuncture and acupressure. Methods: After institutional review board approval, 96 anesthesiology departments stratified by geographic region (Northeast, South, West, and Midwest) and institution type (university medical centers, community hospitals, children's hospitals, and veterans affairs hospitals) were selected for participation in an anonymous, pretested, online survey. The target sample was 1728 providers, of whom 292 (54% anesthesiologists, 44% certified registered nurse anesthetists, 2% anesthesiologist assistants) responded, yielding an overall 17% response rate. Results: Spearman correlation coefficient revealed a statistically significant correlation between acupuncture and geographic region, with the West having the highest predisposition toward acupuncture use (r(s)  = 0.159, p = 0.007). Women are more likely to use acupuncture than men (r(s)  = -0.188; p = 0.002). A strong effect size exists between acupuncture and country of pre-anesthesia training (r(s)  = 1.00; 95% CI = 1.08, 1.16). Some providers have used acupuncture (27%) and acupressure (18%) with positive outcomes; however, the majority have not used these modalities, but would consider using them (54%, SD = 1.44 ; acupressure: 60%, SD = 1.32). Seventy-six percent of respondents would like acupuncture education and 74% would like acupressure education (SDs of 0.43 and 0.44, respectively). Conclusions: While most of the U.S. anesthesia providers in this survey have not used these modalities, they nevertheless report a favorable perception of acupuncture/acupressure's role as part of an anesthetic. This study adds to the body of acupuncture and acupressure research by providing insight into anesthesia providers' perceptions of these alternative medicine modalities.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#4264,The effectiveness of interventions aimed at reducing anxiety in health care waiting spaces: a systematic review of randomized and nonrandomized trials,"BACKGROUND: Reducing waiting anxiety is an important objective of patient-centered care. Anxiety is linked to negative health outcomes, including longer recovery periods, lowered pain thresholds, and for children in particular, resistance to treatment, nightmares, and separation anxiety. The goals of this study were (1) to systematically review published research aimed at reducing preprocedural waiting anxiety, and (2) to provide directions for future research and development of strategies to manage preprocedural waiting anxiety in health care environments. METHODS: We performed a systematic review of the literature via ISI Web of Knowledge, PubMed, PsycINFO, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Medline. Included in this review were studies describing measurable outcomes in response to interventions specifically intended to improve the waiting experience of patients in health care settings. Primary outcomes of interest were stress and anxiety. Exclusion criteria included (a) studies aimed at reducing wait times and management of waiting lists only, (b) waiting in non-health care settings, (c) design of health care facilities with nonspecific strategies pertaining to waiting spaces, (d) strategies to reduce pain or anxiety during the course of medical procedures, and (e) interventions such as massage, acupuncture, or hypnosis that require dedicated staff and/or private waiting environments to administer. RESULTS: We identified 8690 studies. Forty-one articles met the inclusion criteria. In adult populations, 33 studies were identified, wherein the effects of music (n = 25), aromatherapy (n = 6), and interior design features (n = 2) were examined. Eight pediatric studies were identified investigating play opportunities (n = 2), media distractions (n = 2), combined play opportunities and media distractions (n = 3), and music (n = 1). Based on results from 1129 adult participants in the 14 studies that evaluated music and permitted meta-analysis, patients who listened to music before a medical procedure exhibited a lowered-state anxiety (-5.1 ± 0.53 points on the State Trait Anxiety Scale) than those who received standard care. The efficacy of aromatherapy was inconclusive. Studies reporting on the impact of improved interior design of waiting areas, while positive, are minimal and heterogeneous. For children, insufficient evidence is available to corroborate the effectiveness of play opportunities, media distractions, and music for mitigating anxiety in children awaiting medical procedures. CONCLUSIONS: Music is a well-established means of decreasing anxiety in adult patients awaiting medical interventions. The effect of music on children's anxiety is not known. Limited studies and heterogeneity of interventions and methods in the areas of aromatherapy, interior design, digital media, and play opportunities (for children) suggest the need for future research.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#4265,Electroacupuncture for Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy after Stroke: A Meta-Analysis,"BACKGROUND: Reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD) is the common complication among stroke and cerebral injury patients, which is lack of safe and effective treatment. Electroacupuncture (EA) may potentially be a reliably therapy, but the evidence is insufficiency. METHODS: Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wan Fang Data, the Chinese Biology Medicine disc, etc., were searched, until July 20, 2018. We included random control trials that contrast EA with conventional rehabilitation therapy for the treatment of RSD. Main outcomes were visual analog scale score and Fugl-Meyer upper limb motor function scoring scale, other outcomes such as Barthel index, and hand swelling score were also collected. Data in included studies were extracted into an excel and pooled by Stata/MP 14.1. RESULTS: We incorporated 13 studies involving 1040 RSD patients and outcomes were from 2 to 6 weeks' follow-up. The analgesic effect between 2 groups had statistically significant difference (weighted mean difference [WMD] = -1.122, 95% confidence interval [CI] [-1.682 to -.562], P = .000], a statistical difference existed in improving dysfunction between 2 groups: (WMD = 6.039, 95% CI [2.231-.916], P = .000). EA groups had a better effect on improving activities of daily life abilities (WMD = 12.170, 95% CI [6.657-17.682], P < .00011] and better detumescence effect (WMD = -.800, 95% CI [-1.972 to -.212], P = .000] contrast to conventional rehabilitation therapy. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis supports that EA has a positive effect on alleviating pain, improving limb dysfunction, and promoting activities of daily living. On account of moderate-quality random control trials and high heterogeneity, further high-quality studies are imperative to optimize the EA treatment program.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#4267,Registration quality assessment of acupuncture clinical trials,"BACKGROUND: Registration can help with transparency of acupuncture clinical trials (ACTs) by making protocol information and results available to the public. Recently, the number of registered ACTs has increased greatly, but only a few researchers have focused on the quality of ACTs registration. This review provides the first assessment of the registration quality of ACTs and the baseline information for future development. METHODS: All records of ACTs registered in the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) were collected. Data was extracted and input to Excel spreadsheets. The current 20 items of the WHO Trial Registration Data Set (TRDS) and the special prepared items for acupuncture intervention details were used to assess the registration quality of ACTs. RESULTS: A total of 740 records, found in 11 registries, were examined. The number of registered ACTs increased rapidly and involved a number of different diseases. The completeness of 20 items was not too poor due to 16 of them had a higher reported percentage (>85%). The completeness of the 20 items was different among registries. For example, the average registration percentage of 20 items in Clinicaltrials.gov, ChiCTR, ISRCTN and ANZCTR were 89.6%, 92.2%, 82.4% and 91.6% respectively. Detailed information regarding acupuncture intervention was seriously insufficient. Among the 740 registration records, 89.2% lacked information on the style of acupuncture, 80.8% did not contain details regarding the needles used, 53.5% lacked information on the treatment regimen and 76.2% did not give details of other interventions administered with acupuncture. CONCLUSIONS: The overall registration quality of ACTs is not high enough due to the serious lack of information on the specifics of acupuncture intervention. It is vital that a number of special items be set regarding acupuncture in order to develop a suitable system for the registration of ACTs.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#4299,Sanfu herbal patch applied at acupoints in patients with bronchial asthma: statistical analysis plan for a randomised controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Sanfu herbal patch (SHP) is widely used in the prevention and treatment of bronchial asthma in China, but its efficacy and mechanism of action are not completely clear. This trial aims to determine the efficacy of SHP and the underlying mechanism. METHODS/DESIGN: We will conduct a multi-centre parallel randomised controlled trial consisting of 72 participants with bronchial asthma recruited and randomly allocated at a ratio of 1:1 into two groups. The patients in one group will receive three courses of SHP treatment, and the patients in the other group will receive placebo treatment, with 24 weeks of follow-up evaluation for both groups. The primary outcome, i.e. forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1), which refers to the change in FEV1 from the beginning of the baseline to the end of 3 treatment sessions (TSs), will be assessed and compared via Student's t test or the Mann-Whitney U test.

#4300,Effects of acupuncture on the miR-146a-mediated IRAK1/TRAF6/NF-κB signaling pathway in rats with sarcopenia induced by D-galactose,"BACKGROUND: Sarcopenia during aging is closely linked to sterile, low-grade, chronic inflammation. However, considering the increasingly aging global population, the effectiveness of existing treatments for sarcopenia is not exact, and acupuncture, as an effective anti-inflammatory therapy, has the potential to treat it. METHODS: Fifty Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly allocated into five groups, including Control group, D-galactose (D-gal) group, D-gal + acupuncture (DA) group, D-gal + non-acupoint (DN) group and D-gal amino acid mixture (DAA) group. An aging rat was model constructed using D-gal for 12 weeks. Rats in the control group received 0.9% physiological saline daily. Treatment groups were acupunctured or given amino acid mixture interventions daily, and lasted for last 4 consecutive weeks. The effects of acupuncture were evaluated by the hematoxylin and eosin staining (H&E), transmission electron microscopic (TEM) examination and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assays. The anti-inflammatory mechanism of acupuncture was studied by using the expressions of microRNA-146a (miR-146a) mediated nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway-related proteins were detected by immunofluorescence, western blotting, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: Rats injected by D-galactose (D-gal) revealed apparent skeletal muscle atrophy with significantly reduced cross-sectional area and fiber diameter. In contrast, acupuncture treatment alleviated these hallmarks of skeletal muscle atrophy and mitigated the mitochondrial aberrations and skeletal muscle apoptosis in D-gal rats. In addition, acupuncture also downgraded the overexpression of inflammatory factors in skeletal muscle, influenced miR-146a and the target genes level, and inhibited NF-κB nuclear translation in D-gal rats. CONCLUSIONS: Acupuncture may ameliorate skeletal muscle atrophy, and its effects may be associated with the control of mitochondrial function regulation and the suppression of inflammation.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#4319,The clinical effect of plum blossom needle acupuncture with qi-invigorating superficies-consolidating therapy on seborrheic alopecia,"BACKGROUND: Seborrheic alopecia (SA) is a common dermatological disease with a long disease course, and treatment for this disease usually exhibits slow effects. Currently, Western medicine treatments have shown some effects; however, they also have certain limitations. In recent years, Chinese medicine has made breakthroughs in treating SA. The efficacy of plum blossom needle acupuncture with qi-invigorating superficies-consolidating therapy for SA was observed, and its clinical effects were investigated in this study. METHODS: A total of 87 patients with SA treated at the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine from September 2018 to September 2019 were enrolled as the research subjects. They were divided into a Western medicine group and a Chinese medicine group by the random number table method. The 43 patients in the Western medicine group were treated with conventional Western medicine, and the 44 patients in the Chinese medicine group were treated with a comprehensive traditional Chinese medicine regimen of plum blossom needling with qi-invigorating superficies-consolidating therapy. The treatment effects, changes in estradiol (E2) and testosterone (T) levels, and scores for various body signs (hair growth and hair loss) of the two groups before and after treatment were compared. RESULTS: The difference in total effective rate between the Chinese medicine group and the Western medicine group (95.45% vs. 81.40%) was statistically significant (P<0.05). After treatment, the T levels of both groups were lower than before treatment, and the E2 levels of both groups were higher than before treatment; the difference between the two groups was statistically significant (P<0.05). After treatment, the hair growth and hair loss scores of the two groups were lower than those before treatment, and those of the Chinese medicine group were lower than those of the Western medicine group; the differences were statistically significant (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Plum blossom needle acupuncture combined with qi-invigorating superficies-consolidating therapy is significantly effective for treating patients with SA. It can effectively adjust the patient's hormone levels, improve hair loss, and promote hair growth. It has the advantages of simplicity, tolerability, and low cost. It cures the cause of the disease and is worth promoting.",No,No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No
#4322,Acupuncture for epilepsy,"BACKGROUND: Seizures are poorly controlled in many people with epilepsy despite adequate current antiepileptic treatments. There is increasing interest in alternative therapies such as acupuncture; however, it remains unclear whether the existing evidence is rigorous enough to support the use of acupuncture. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture in people with epilepsy. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group's Specialized Register (June 2005) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2005). We also searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED, TCMLARS, China Biological Medicine Database, Chinese Acupuncture Trials Register, National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, and National Institute of Health Clinical Trials Database from inception to June 2005. Reference lists from relevant trials were reviewed. No language restrictions were imposed. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials evaluating any form of acupuncture involving people of any age with any type of epilepsy were included. Trials included were those comparing acupuncture with placebo, sham or no treatment; or comparing acupuncture plus other treatments with the same other treatments. Trials that only compared different acupuncture methods or compared acupuncture alone with other treatments were excluded. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently extracted trial data and assessed trial quality using the Jadad score. Relative risk (RR) was used for binary data and weighted mean difference for continuous data, and 95% confidence intervals are given. Where possible, analyses were by intention to treat. MAIN RESULTS: Three small trials of varying methodological quality and with short follow up met the inclusion criteria. Two studied children in China and one studied adults in Norway. The two Chinese studies compared acupuncture plus Chinese herbs with Chinese herbs alone while the Norwegian study compared acupuncture with sham acupuncture. The two Chinese studies found that more children treated with acupuncture achieved 75% or greater reduction in seizure frequency (RR 1.52, 95% CI 1.12 to 2.05) and seizure duration (RR 2.38, 95% CI 1.13 to 5) with a significant 50% or greater reduction in seizure duration (RR 1.36, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.73). However, the two trials were of low quality without adequate description of randomisation method, concealment of randomisation or blinding. On the other hand, the higher quality Norwegian trial found that acupuncture did not improve the mean seizure frequency, seizure-free weeks, or quality of life in adults. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The current evidence does not support acupuncture as a treatment for epilepsy. Much larger high quality clinical trials employing appropriate controls are needed.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#4324,Self-management education programmes for osteoarthritis,"BACKGROUND: Self-management education programmes are complex interventions specifically targeted at patient education and behaviour modification. They are designed to encourage people with chronic disease to take an active self-management role to supplement medical care and improve outcomes. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of self-management education programmes for people with osteoarthritis. SEARCH METHODS: The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PyscINFO, SCOPUS and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trial Registry Platform were searched, without language restriction, on 17 January 2013. We checked references of reviews and included trials to identify additional studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials of self-management education programmes in people with osteoarthritis were included. Studies with participants receiving passive recipients of care and studies comparing one type of programme versus another were excluded. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: In addition to standard methods we extracted components of the self-management interventions using the eight domains of the Health Education Impact Questionnaire (heiQ), and contextual and participant characteristics using PROGRESS-Plus and the Health Literacy Questionnaire (HLQ). Outcomes included self-management of osteoarthritis, participant's positive and active engagement in life, pain, global symptom score, self-reported function, quality of life and withdrawals (including dropouts and those lost to follow-up). We assessed the quality of the body of evidence for these outcomes using the GRADE approach. MAIN RESULTS: We included twenty-nine studies (6,753 participants) that compared self-management education programmes to attention control (five studies), usual care (17 studies), information alone (four studies) or another intervention (seven studies). Although heterogeneous, most interventions included elements of skill and technique acquisition (94%), health-directed activity (85%) and self-monitoring and insight (79%); social integration and support were addressed in only 12%. Most studies did not provide enough information to assess all PROGRESS-Plus items. Eight studies included predominantly Caucasian, educated female participants, and only four provided any information on participants' health literacy. All studies were at high risk of performance and detection bias for self-reported outcomes; 20 studies were at high risk of selection bias, 16 were at high risk of attrition bias, two were at high risk of reporting bias and 12 were at risk of other biases. We deemed attention control as the most appropriate and thus the main comparator.Compared with attention control, self-management programmes may not result in significant benefits at 12 months. Low-quality evidence from one study (344 people) indicates that self-management skills were similar in active and control groups: 5.8 points on a 10-point self-efficacy scale in the control group, and the mean difference (MD) between groups was 0.4 points (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.39 to 1.19). Low-quality evidence from four studies (575 people) indicates that self-management programmes may lead to a small but clinically unimportant reduction in pain: the standardised mean difference (SMD) between groups was -0.26 (95% CI -0.44 to -0.09); pain was 6 points on a 0 to 10 visual analogue scale (VAS) in the control group, treatment resulted in a mean reduction of 0.8 points (95% CI -0.14 to -0.3) on a 10-point scale, with number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) of 8 (95% CI 5 to 23). Low-quality evidence from one study (251 people) indicates that the mean global osteoarthritis score was 4.2 on a 0 to 10-point symptom scale (lower better) in the control group, and treatment reduced symptoms by a mean of 0.14 points (95% CI -0.54 to 0.26). This result does not exclude the possibility of a clinically important benefit in some people (0.5 point reduction included in 95% CI). Low-quality evidence from three studies (574 people) showed no signficant difference in function between groups (SMD -0.19, 95% CI -0.5 to 0.11); mean function was 1.29 points on a 0 to 3-point scale in the control group, and treatment resulted in a mean improvement of 0.04 points with self-management (95% CI -0.10 to 0.02). Low-quality evidence from one study (165 people) showed no between-group difference in quality of life (MD -0.01, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.01) from a control group mean of 0.57 units on 0 to 1 well-being scale. Moderate-quality evidence from five studies (937 people) shows similar withdrawal rates between self-management (13%) and control groups (12%): RR 1.11 (95% CI 0.78 to 1.57). Positive and active engagement in life was not measured.Compared with usual care, moderate-quality evidence from 11 studies (up to 1,706 participants) indicates that self-management programmes probably provide small benefits up to 21 months, in terms of self-management skills, pain, osteoarthritis symptoms and function, although these are of doubtful clinical importance, and no improvement in positive and active engagement in life or quality of life. Withdrawal rates were similar. Low to moderate quality evidence indicates no important differences in self-management , pain, symptoms, function, quality of life or withdrawal rates between self-management programmes and information alone or other interventions (exercise, physiotherapy, social support or acupuncture). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Low to moderate quality evidence indicates that self-management education programmes result in no or small benefits in people with osteoarthritis but are unlikely to cause harm.Compared with attention control, these programmes probably do not improve self-management skills, pain, osteoarthritis symptoms, function or quality of life, and have unknown effects on positive and active engagement in life. Compared with usual care, they may slightly improve self-management skills, pain, function and symptoms, although these benefits are of unlikely clinical importance.Further studies investigating the effects of self-management education programmes, as delivered in the trials in this review, are unlikely to change our conclusions substantially, as confounding from biases across studies would have likely favoured self-management. However, trials assessing other models of self-management education programme delivery may be warranted. These should adequately describe the intervention they deliver and consider the expanded PROGRESS-Plus framework and health literacy, to explore issues of health equity for recipients.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#4331,"Evaluation on the effect of acupuncture on patients with sepsis-induced myopathy (ACU-SIM pilot study): A single center, propensity-score stratified, assessor-blinded, prospective pragmatic controlled trial","BACKGROUND: Sepsis-induced myopathy (SIM) is a disease that causes motor dysfunction in patients with sepsis. There is currently no targeted treatment for this disease. Acupuncture has shown considerable efficacy in the treatment of sepsis and muscle weakness. Therefore, our research aims to explore the effects of acupuncture on the improvement of muscle structure and function in SIM patients and on activities of daily living. METHODS: The ACU-SIM pilot study is a single-center, propensity-score stratified, assessor-blinded, prospective pragmatic controlled trial (pCT) with a 1-year follow-up period. This study will be deployed in a multi-professional critical care department at a tertiary teaching hospital in Guangzhou, China. Ninety-eight intensive care unit subjects will be recruited and assigned to either the control group or the acupuncture group. Both groups will receive basic treatment for sepsis, and the acupuncture group will additionally receive acupuncture treatment. The primary outcomes will be the rectus femoris cross-sectional area, the Medical Research Council sum-score and time-to-event (defined as all-cause mortality or unplanned readmission to the intensive care unit due to invasive ventilation). The activities of daily living will be accessed by the motor item of the Functional Independence Measure. Recruitment will last for 2 years, and each patient will have a 1-year follow-up after the intervention. DISCUSSION: There is currently no research on the therapeutic effects of acupuncture on SIM. The results of this study may contribute to new knowledge regarding early muscle atrophy and the treatment effect of acupuncture in SIM patients, and the results may also direct new approaches and interventions in these patients. This trial will serve as a pilot study for an upcoming multicenter real-world study.

#4346,A scoping review on hyposalivation associated with systemic conditions: the role of physical stimulation in the treatment approaches,"BACKGROUND: Several systemic conditions can result in distinct degrees of salivary gland damage and consequent hypofunction. The development of successful management schemes is highly challenging due to the complexity of saliva. This study aimed to systematically map the literature on the physical stimulation of salivary glands for hyposalivation management and the response of individuals according to different systemic conditions causing salivary impairment. METHODS: A systematic search in the literature was performed. Two reviewers independently selected clinical trials, randomized or not, that used physical stimulation to treat hyposalivation caused by systemic conditions. Studies evaluating healthy subjects without hyposalivation were included as controls. Single-arm clinical studies or case series were also included for protocol mapping (PRISMA extension for scoping reviews). RESULTS: Out of 24 included studies, 10 evaluated healthy subjects, from which 9 tested transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) and 1 tested acupuncture and electroacupuncture. Fourteen studies evaluated individuals with hyposalivation: 6 applied TENS, 6 applied low-level laser therapy (LLLT), and 2 applied acupuncture, carried out in post-chemotherapy, medication use, postmenopausal women, hemodialysis patients, smokers, diabetics, Sjögren's syndrome (SS). All showed increased salivation after treatment, except for two LLLT studies in individuals with SS. CONCLUSIONS: Among the different patient groups, individuals with Sjögren's syndrome (SS) exhibited the poorest responses, while those with medication-induced hyposalivation demonstrated the most favorable treatment outcomes, independently of the management strategy for saliva stimulation. It means that physical stimulation of salivary glands holds promise as an alternative for managing hyposalivation in cases of reversible gland damage. However, to make informed decisions in current practice, it is necessary to conduct new well-designed randomized clinical trials with appropriate methodologies.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#4366,Acupuncture treatment of shoulder impingement syndrome: A randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Shoulder pain or omalgia is one of the main types of osteoarticular pain that can be observed in every-day clinical practice, frequently causing significant functional impairment. The most common cause of shoulder pain is impingement syndrome. OBJECTIVE: To decrease the intensity of short- and mid-term pain in the injured shoulder by means of acupuncture. METHOD: Randomized controlled trial with two groups of participants: one group received true acupuncture (TA) and the other received acupuncture at sham points (SA). The treatment was carried out over 4 weeks, with the participants receiving a session every week. The results were measured immediately after the treatment (T1) and 3 months later (T2). To evaluate the results, we used the 100 mm Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), and to assess the functionality of the shoulder we employed the UCLA questionnaire (0-35 points). RESULTS: A total of 68 participants were included in the analysis (TA, n=35; SA, n=33), with a mean age of 33.4 years (SD 12.53). We found significant differences in the analyzed results between the two groups, as we observed a decrease on the intensity of pain for the TA group of 44.13 mm at T1 (CI 95% 36.7; 51.5) and 87.58 mm at T2 (CI 95% 28.32; 46.81), while the decrease in the FA group was of 19.84 mm at T1 (CI 95% 12.2; 27.4) and 20 mm at T2 (CI 95% 10.9; 29.09). When the UCLA scores were analyzed, the results were clinically meaningful in support of TA in terms of functional assessment of the shoulder. No adverse effects were reported. CONCLUSIONS: The use of acupuncture to treat impingement syndrome seems to be a safe and reliable technique to achieve clinically significant results and could be implemented in the therapy options offered by the health services.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes
#4377,An updated review of the efficacy of cupping therapy,"BACKGROUND: Since 1950, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) cupping therapy has been applied as a formal modality in hospitals throughout China and elsewhere in the world. Based on a previous systematic literature review of clinical studies on cupping therapy, this study presents a thorough review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate the therapeutic effect of cupping therapy. METHOD: Six databases were searched for articles published through 2010. RCTs on cupping therapy for various diseases were included. Studies on cupping therapy combined with other TCM treatments versus non-TCM therapies were excluded. RESULTS: 135 RCTs published from 1992 through 2010 were identified. The studies were generally of low methodological quality. Diseases for which cupping therapy was commonly applied were herpes zoster, facial paralysis (Bell palsy), cough and dyspnea, acne, lumbar disc herniation, and cervical spondylosis. Wet cupping was used in most trials, followed by retained cupping, moving cupping, and flash cupping. Meta-analysis showed cupping therapy combined with other TCM treatments was significantly superior to other treatments alone in increasing the number of cured patients with herpes zoster, facial paralysis, acne, and cervical spondylosis. No serious adverse effects were reported in the trials. CONCLUSIONS: Numerous RCTs on cupping therapy have been conducted and published during the past decades. This review showed that cupping has potential effect in the treatment of herpes zoster and other specific conditions. However, further rigorously designed trials on its use for other conditions are warranted.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#4389,Study on acupuncture improving sleep deprivation comorbid with cognitive dysfunction based on rs-fMRI: A protocol for systematic review and meta-analysis,"BACKGROUND: Sleep deprivation often lead to changes in attention, memory, mood, alertness, and metabolism. Especially, it is often accompanied by cognitive impairment of the brain. Acupuncture is safe and effective for improving cognitive function, but its underlying mechanism is not fully understood. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging is an important means to study brain activity changes. However, the results are inconsistent and lack systematic evaluation and analysis. METHODS: We will search 9 databases, including PubMed, EMBASE, EBSCOhost-Medline, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, VIP Database and Wan-Fang Database, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, and 2 clinical trials register platforms: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, ClinicalTrials.gov (www.ClinicalTrials.gov/) from inception to November 1, 2022. We will use the Review Manager 5.4 software provided by the Cochrane Collaborative Network for statistical analysis. We then assessed the quality and risk of the included studies and observed the outcome measures. RESULTS: This study will analyze the effect of acupuncture on brain activity changes, improvement of sleep duration, and cognitive impairment. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis aims to investigate the efficacy of acupuncture on brain activity changes in sleep deprivation comorbid with cognitive dysfunction, so as to provide effective evidence for clarifying its pathogenesis.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#4399,Electroacupuncture for slow flow/no-reflow phenomenon in patients with acute myocardial infarction undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention: protocol for a pilot randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Slow flow/no-reflow (SF-NR) during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is associated with poor prognosis of patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Currently, effective treatment is not available for SF-NR. Electroacupuncture (EA) has shown significant efficacy as an adjuvant therapy for many cardiovascular diseases by improving microcirculation and reducing ischemia-reperfusion injury. However, its effects on SF-NR in the AMI patients during PCI are not clear. This pilot trial aims to determine the efficacy of intraoperative EA in alleviating SF-NR in AMI patients undergoing PCI. METHODS: This prospective, single-center, randomized controlled, pilot trial will recruit 60 AMI patients scheduled for PCI at the Yueyang Hospital of Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine, China. The patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio into the EA or the control groups. Patients in the control group will undergo standard PCI. Patients in the EA group will undergo intraoperative electroacupuncture while undergoing standard PCI. Incidence of SF-NR is the primary outcome for this study. This study will also assess secondary outcomes including cardiac biomarkers, inflammatory biomarkers, pain and anxiety scores, electrocardiography parameters, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) symptom score, and major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCE). All the included patients will undergo laboratory tests including routine blood tests, levels of electrolytes, as well as liver and renal function tests. Patients will be followed up for 1 month after the procedure. DISCUSSION: This pilot trial will provide evidence for the potential benefits of intraoperative EA in improving microvascular perfusion and preventing or alleviating SF-NR during PCI in patients with AMI. If proven effective, intraoperative EA will provide a new and effective strategy against SF-NR and provide evidence for subsequent multicenter trials.

#4403,Ear acupressure for smoking cessation: study protocol for a randomised controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Smoking is the largest preventable cause of death and disease worldwide but smokers often fail to quit due to nicotine withdrawal symptoms. Current available pharmaceutical therapies may assist with smoking cessation but may have side effects. Ear acupressure (EAP) and ear acupuncture have been used for smoking cessation, and some positive results have been reported. The aim of the study is to assess the efficacy and safety of EAP in assisting individuals to quit smoking and/or support them in the management of nicotine withdrawal symptoms. METHODS: This study will be a randomised, single-blind, sham-controlled study conducted at RMIT University in Melbourne, Australia. Adult smokers will be randomly assigned to receive EAP specifically for smoking cessation or nonspecific EAP treatments. After a 2-week run-in, participants will be treated once a week for 8 weeks and followed up for 12 weeks. The primary outcome measures will be 7 day point-prevalence cessation rate by self-report validated by expired carbon monoxide and nicotine withdrawal symptoms measured by the Mood and Physical Symptoms Score questionnaire. Secondary outcomes will be self-reported usage of nicotine replacement therapies, cigarette consumption, body weight change and quality of life. The safety end point will be self-reported adverse events associated with EAP. Intention-to-treat analysis will be applied. DISCUSSION: Findings from this study will determine if this EAP intervention alone can be an effective and safe therapy to assist with smoking cessation and the management of nicotine withdrawal symptoms.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#4424,Systematic Review: Acupuncture vs Standard Pharmacological Therapy for Migraine Prevention,"BACKGROUND: Standard pharmacological treatment of migraine has many shortcomings. Acupuncture is becoming a more widely used therapy for the prevention and treatment of migraine, but its effectiveness is still in question when compared to the pharmacological treatments even though very few of these have Class A and B evidence for migraine prevention. This is a systematic review of data from existing randomized trials that compare the effectiveness of acupuncture treatment with conventional migraine preventative medications. METHODS: Custom-designed strategy was used for searching Pubmed (includes MEDLINE), Scopus (includes EMBASE). The inclusion criteria were English language and randomized trials. No date restriction was utilized. We included randomized trials and randomized controlled trials in adult patients that compared the clinical effects of acupuncture with a standard migraine preventive medication in patients with a diagnosis of chronic or episodic migraine with or without aura. We excluded letters and studies on acupuncture for headaches other than migraine. Two reviewers checked eligibility; extracted information on patients, interventions, methods, and results; and assessed the quality of the acupuncture intervention based on the American Academy of Neurology Classification of evidence matrix for therapeutic trials. The present review was not registered. RESULTS: Out of the 706 search results, 7 clinical trials, with a total of 1430 participants, met inclusion criteria for trials comparing the effectiveness of acupuncture to standard pharmacologic treatment. Several of the studies showed acupuncture to be more effective than standard pharmacological treatments for migraine prevention; however, methodological heterogeneity precluded aggregation of these data. CONCLUSIONS: There is growing evidence that acupuncture is just as effective and has fewer side effects than many of the standard pharmaceutical agents that are currently used. However, the heterogeneity of the existing studies limits the effective comparison and analysis.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#4429,Efficacy and safety of acupuncture treatment for stiff neck: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"BACKGROUND: Stiff neck is a common acute musculoskeletal condition that significantly affects the quality of life of patients. Acupuncture is recommended as an effective method for alleviating pain and restoring neck mobility in patients with stiff neck, but there is currently a lack of scientific evidence supporting its efficacy and safety. The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of acupuncture in the treatment of stiff neck. METHOD: This study searched 8 Chinese and English electronic medical databases, including China Biology Medicine disc, VIP database, Wanfang Data, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Web of Science, PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library, with a search period up to May 13, 2024. The focus was on clinical randomized controlled trials evaluating acupuncture treatment for stiff neck. The primary outcome measures were the total effective rate and visual analog scale scores. The quality of evidence and methodology of the included studies were assessed according to the GRADEpro guidelines. Meta-analysis was conducted to assess the results, with heterogeneity analysis, sensitivity analysis, subgroup analysis, trial sequential analysis, and publication bias analysis performed to verify the robustness of the combined results and explore potential sources of heterogeneity. RESULT: This study evaluated 10 clinical randomized controlled trials comparing acupuncture therapy with conventional treatment, involving 754 patients. The treatment group received acupuncture alone or in combination with conventional treatment, whereas the control group received only conventional treatment. The analysis results showed that the treatment group was significantly superior to the control group in improving the total effective rate (risk ratio = 1.12, 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.04, 1.21], P = .002), reducing visual analog scale scores (mean difference [MD] = -0.93, 95% CI [-1.29, -0.57], P < .001), reducing neck disability index scores (MD = -6.39, 95% CI [-6.79, -6.00], P < .001), and restoring cervical range of motion (cervical lateral flexion: MD = 4.29, 95% CI [3.15, 5.43], P < .001; cervical rotation: MD = 6.08, 95% CI [4.46, 7.70], P < .001).

#4443,Study on the therapeutic effect of floating needle therapy combined with pressing acupoint embedding for female stress urinary incontinence after childbirth: a randomized trial,"BACKGROUND: Stress urinary incontinence is a common and widespread problem among women that can significantly reduce the quality of life of those affected and potentially result in limitations to the lives and activities of their friends and family members. We aimed to observe the effect of floating needle therapy combined with acupuncture point embedding in the treatment of female stress urinary incontinence after childbirth. METHODS: A total of 64 postpartum female stress urinary incontinence patients who were treated and hospitalized in the Urology Clinic of the Ningbo Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital of the Zhejiang Province from September 2020 to August 2021 were randomly allocated to the experimental group and the control group, each with 32 cases. The control group was treated with the drug midodrine combined with Kegel training, and the experimental group was treated with floating needle therapy combined with acupoint embedding. After 8 weeks of continuous treatment, the pelvic floor muscle strength, urinary incontinence score, and the improvement of urine leakage in the 1 h pad test were observed. We then evaluated the clinical efficacy of the 2 groups and the state of urinary incontinence at 3 months and 6 months as assessed by telephone follow-up. RESULTS: After treatment, the pelvic floor muscle strength of the 2 groups had significantly increased, and both the urinary incontinence score and the urine leakage volume of the 1 h pad test were significantly reduced. The pelvic floor muscle strength of the experimental group was significantly higher than that of the control group after treatment, the urinary incontinence score and the amount of urine leakage of the 1 h pad test were significantly lower than those of the control group. The total effective rate of the experimental group was 90.63% (27/32), which was higher than that of the control group (71.88%, 23/32). CONCLUSIONS: With the benefits of being both convenient and efficient, floating needle therapy combined with press-needle acupoint embedding is effective in treating female stress urinary incontinence after childbirth.

#4469,Acupuncture for stroke rehabilitation,"BACKGROUND: Stroke is the second most common cause of death in the world and in China it has now become the main cause of death. It is also a main cause of adult disability and dependency. Acupuncture for stroke has been used in China for hundreds of years and is increasingly practiced in some Western countries. This is an update of the Cochrane review originally published in 2006 . OBJECTIVES: To determine the efficacy and safety of acupuncture therapy in people with subacute and chronic stroke. We intended to test the following hypotheses: 1) acupuncture can reduce the risk of death or dependency in people with subacute and chronic stroke at the end of treatment and at follow-up; 2) acupuncture can improve neurological deficit and quality of life after treatment and at the end of follow-up; 3) acupuncture can reduce the number of people requiring institutional care; and 4) acupuncture is not associated with any intolerable adverse effects. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (June 2015), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; Cochrane Library 2015, Issue 7), MEDLINE (1966 to July 2015, Ovid), EMBASE (1980 to July 2015, Ovid), CINAHL (1982 to July 2015, EBSCO), and AMED (1985 to July 2015, Ovid). We also searched the following four Chinese medical databases: China Biological Medicine Database (July 2015); Chinese Science and Technique Journals Database (July 2015); China National Infrastructure (July 2015), and Wan Fang database (July 2015). SELECTION CRITERIA: Truly randomised unconfounded clinical trials among people with ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke, in the subacute or chronic stage, comparing acupuncture involving needling with placebo acupuncture, sham acupuncture, or no acupuncture. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed quality, extracted and cross-checked the data. MAIN RESULTS: We included 31 trials with a total of 2257 participants in the subacute or chronic stages of stroke. The methodological quality of most of the included trials was not high. The quality of evidence for the main outcomes was low or very low based on the assessment by the system of Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE).Two trials compared real acupuncture plus baseline treatment with sham acupuncture plus baseline treatment. There was no evidence of differences in the changes of motor function and quality of life between real acupuncture and sham acupuncture for people with stroke in the convalescent stage.Twenty-nine trials compared acupuncture plus baseline treatment versus baseline treatment alone. Compared with no acupuncture, for people with stroke in the convalescent phase, acupuncture had beneficial effects on the improvement of dependency (activity of daily living) measured by Barthel Index (nine trials, 616 participants; mean difference (MD) 9.19, 95% confidence interval (CI) 4.34 to 14.05; GRADE very low), global neurological deficiency (seven trials, 543 participants; odds ratio (OR) 3.89, 95% CI 1.78 to 8.49; GRADE low), and specific neurological impairments including motor function measured by Fugl-Meyer Assessment (four trials, 245 participants; MD 6.16, 95% CI 4.20 to 8.11; GRADE low), cognitive function measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination (five trials, 278 participants; MD 2.54, 95% CI 0.03 to 5.05; GRADE very low), depression measured by the Hamilton Depression Scale (six trials, 552 participants; MD -2.58, 95% CI -3.28 to -1.87; GRADE very low), swallowing function measured by drinking test (two trials, 200 participants; MD -1.11, 95% CI -2.08 to -0.14; GRADE very low), and pain measured by the Visual Analogue Scale (two trials, 118 participants; MD -2.88, 95% CI -3.68 to -2.09; GRADE low). Sickness caused by acupuncture and intolerance of pain at acupoints were reported in a few participants with stroke in the acupuncture groups. No data on death, the proportion of people requiring institutional care or requiring extensive family support, and all-cause mortality were available in all included trials. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: From the available evidence, acupuncture may have beneficial effects on improving dependency, global neurological deficiency, and some specific neurological impairments for people with stroke in the convalescent stage, with no obvious serious adverse events. However, most included trials were of inadequate quality and size. There is, therefore, inadequate evidence to draw any conclusions about its routine use. Rigorously designed, randomised, multi-centre, large sample trials of acupuncture for stroke are needed to further assess its effects.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#4478,"Effects of programmed flexor-extensor alternating electrical acupoint stimulation on upper limb motor functional reconstruction after stroke: study protocol for a double-blind, randomized controlled trial","BACKGROUND: Stroke's prevalence and morbidity are increasing (Guano, et al. Neuro 89:53-61, 2017), and limb motor dysfunction is left in most patients (Gittler, et al. JAMA 319:820-821, 2018). Particularly, the rehabilitation of upper limbs is more difficult and time-consuming (Borges, et al. The Cochrane database of systematic reviews 10:CD011887, 2018). METHODS: A double-blind randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be conducted to investigate whether a new functional electrical stimulation (FES) combined with acupoint therapy is more effective in the rehabilitation of upper limb motor dysfunction after stroke. Patients who meet the inclusion criteria will be randomly divided into two groups: programmed flexor-extensor alternating electrical acupoint stimulation group (PES group) and conventional flexor-extensor alternating electrical acupoint stimulation group (CES group), which will be treated for 3 weeks. The primary outcome measures are electroencephalogram (EEG) and surface electromyogram (sEMG). The secondary outcome variables include MBI (modified Barthel index), China Stroke Scale (CSS), FMA-U (Fugl-Meyer assessment upper limb), MMT (manual muscle testing), and Brunnstrom. DISCUSSION: The results of this study are expected to verify the efficacy of PES therapy in the rehabilitation of upper limb motor function after stroke. This may promote the widespread use of the therapy in hospitals, communities, and homes for early and continuous treatment. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05333497.

#4486,"Physiological changes associated with de qi during electroacupuncture to LI4 and LI11: a randomised, placebo-controlled trial","BACKGROUND: Studies on the relationship between de qi intensity and activity changes in the autonomic nervous system (ANS) are scarce. This study investigates the physiological responses associated with de qi. The relationship between de qi intensity and such responses was determined. METHOD: This was a single-blinded, randomised, placebo-controlled trial. A total of 36 subjects (19 men, 17 women), aged 34.5±4.6 years, were randomly assigned to group 1 (electroacupuncture at 2 Hz, 0.4 ms to right LI4 and LI11 for 30 min), group 2 (electroacupuncture stimulation to bilateral patellae) or group 3 (sham electroacupuncture to right LI4 and LI11 but over Duoderm pads). Heart rate (HR), mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and HR variability by low/high frequency (LF/HF) were recorded 5 min before, during and 5 min after the intervention. Needle sensations were quantified by the Modified Massachusetts General Hospital Acupuncture Sensation Scale - Chinese version (C-MMASS) and the C-MMASS index was computed. RESULTS: A significant increase in LF/HF, MAP and HR was observed in group 1. A small and significant increase in LF/HF was observed in group 2 but the changes in MAP and HR in groups 2 and 3 were not significant. The C-MMASS index was highest in group 1 (5.3±1.3), moderate in group 2 (3.5±0.7) and lowest in group 3 (0.77±0.2). A positive correlation between de qi intensity and changes in LF/HF, MAP and HR was observed. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that de qi is associated with physiological changes, and that de qi intensity increases with an increase in sympathetic discharge of the ANS.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes
#4495,Acupuncture for Subthreshold Depression: Study Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial,"BACKGROUND: Subthreshold depression refers to a state of mental sub-health that has depressive symptoms but does not meet the diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder. It is a strong risk factor for depression and is related to an increase in suicide and mortality. Studies suggest that acupuncture may be effective in the treatment of subthreshold depression, but no evidence has proven that the efficacy of acupuncture for subthreshold depression is a specific therapeutic effect or a placebo effect. METHODS: This will be a prospective, randomized, controlled, and double-blind study of 64 patients with subthreshold depression. They will be randomly assigned as verum or minimal acupuncture group members. Patients in the verum acupuncture group will receive acupuncture at the acupoints, and those in the minimal acupuncture group will receive minimal acupuncture at non-acupoints. The interventions will be delivered over an 8-week period. The primary outcome measure will be the Hamilton Depression Scale-17 (HAMD-17). The secondary outcome measures will be the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7), and SF-12v2 Health Survey. The assessments will occur at baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and during a follow-up period.

#4496,Sucrose analgesia for heel-lance procedures in neonates,"BACKGROUND: Sucrose has been examined for calming and pain-relieving effects in neonates for invasive procedures such as heel lance. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of sucrose for relieving pain from heel lance in neonates in terms of immediate and long-term outcomes SEARCH METHODS: We searched (February 2022): CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Web of Science, and three trial registries. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials where term and/or preterm neonates received sucrose for heel lances. Comparison treatments included water/placebo/no intervention, non-nutritive sucking (NNS), glucose, breastfeeding, breast milk, music, acupuncture, facilitated tucking, and skin-to-skin care. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard Cochrane methods. We reported mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using the fixed-effect model for continuous outcome measures. We assessed heterogeneity by the I(2) test. We used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence. MAIN RESULTS: We included 55 trials (6273 infants): 29 included term neonates, 22 included preterm neonates, and four included both. Heel lance was investigated in 50 trials; 15 investigated other minor painful procedures in addition to lancing. Sucrose vs control The evidence suggests that sucrose probably results in a reduction in PIPP scores compared to the control group at 30 seconds (MD -1.74 (95% CI -2.11 to -1.37); I(2) = 62%; moderate-certainty evidence) and 60 seconds after lancing (MD -2.14, 95% CI -3.34 to -0.94; I(2) = 0%; moderate-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of sucrose on DAN scores compared to water at 30 seconds after lancing (MD -1.90, 95% CI -8.58 to 4.78; heterogeneity not applicable (N/A); very low-certainty evidence). The evidence suggests that sucrose probably results in a reduction in NIPS scores compared to water immediately after lancing (MD -2.00, 95% CI -2.42 to -1.58; heterogeneity N/A; moderate-certainty evidence). Sucrose vs NNS The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of sucrose on PIPP scores compared to NNS during the recovery period after lancing (MD 0.60, 95% CI -0.30 to 1.50; heterogeneity not applicable; very low-certainty evidence) and on DAN scores at 30 seconds after lancing (MD -1.20, 95% CI -7.87 to 5.47; heterogeneity N/A; very low-certainty evidence). Sucrose + NNS vs NNS The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of sucrose + NNS on PIPP scores compared to NNS during lancing (MD -4.90, 95% CI -5.73 to -4.07; heterogeneity not applicable; very low-certainty evidence) and during recovery after lancing (MD -3.80, 95% CI -4.47 to -3.13; heterogeneity N/A; very low-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of sucrose + NNS on NFCS scores compared to water + NNS during lancing (MD -0.60, 95% CI -1.47 to 0.27; heterogeneity N/A; very low-certainty evidence). Sucrose vs glucose The evidence suggests that sucrose results in little to no difference in PIPP scores compared to glucose at 30 seconds (MD 0.26, 95% CI -0.70 to 1.22; heterogeneity not applicable; low-certainty evidence) and 60 seconds after lancing (MD -0.02, 95% CI -0.79 to 0.75; heterogeneity N/A; low-certainty evidence). Sucrose vs breastfeeding The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of sucrose on PIPP scores compared to breastfeeding at 30 seconds after lancing (MD -0.70, 95% CI -0.49 to 1.88; I(2) = 94%; very low-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of sucrose on COMFORTneo scores compared to breastfeeding after lancing (MD -2.60, 95% CI -3.06 to -2.14; heterogeneity N/A; very low-certainty evidence). Sucrose vs expressed breast milk The evidence suggests that sucrose may result in little to no difference in PIPP-R scores compared to expressed breast milk during (MD 0.3, 95% CI -0.24 to 0.84; heterogeneity not applicable; low-certainty evidence) and at 30 seconds after lancing (MD 0.3, 95% CI -0.11 to 0.71; heterogeneity N/A; low-certainty evidence). The evidence suggests that sucrose probably may result in slightly increased PIPP-R scores compared to expressed breast milk 60 seconds after lancing (MD 1.10, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.86; heterogeneity N/A; low-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of sucrose on DAN scores compared to expressed breast milk 30 seconds after lancing (MD -1.80, 95% CI -8.47 to 4.87; heterogeneity N/A; very low-certainty evidence). Sucrose vs laser acupuncture There was no difference in PIPP-R scores between sucrose and music groups; however, data were reported as medians and IQRs. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of sucrose on NIPS scores compared to laser acupuncture during lancing (MD -0.86, 95% CI -1.43 to -0.29; heterogeneity N/A; very low-certainty evidence). Sucrose vs facilitated tucking The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of sucrose on total BPSN scores compared to facilitated tucking during lancing (MD -2.27, 95% CI -4.66 to 0.12; heterogeneity N/A; very low-certainty evidence) and during recovery after lancing (MD -0.31, 95% CI -1.72 to 1.10; heterogeneity N/A; very low-certainty evidence). Sucrose vs skin-to-skin + water (repeated lancing) The evidence suggests that sucrose results in little to no difference in PIPP scores compared to skin-to-skin + water at 30 seconds after 1st (MD 0.13, 95% CI -0.70 to 0.96); 2nd (MD -0.56, 95% CI -1.57 to 0.45); or 3rd lancing (MD-0.15, 95% CI -1.26 to 0.96); heterogeneity N/A, low-certainty evidence for all comparisons. The evidence suggests that sucrose results in little to no difference in PIPP scores compared to skin-to-skin + water at 60 seconds after 1st (MD -0.61, 95% CI -1.55 to 0.33); 2nd (MD -0.12, 95% CI -0.99 to 0.75); or 3rd lancing (MD-0.40, 95% CI -1.48 to 0.68); heterogeneity N/A, low-certainty evidence for all comparisons. Minor adverse events required no intervention. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Sucrose compared to control probably results in a reduction of PIPP scores 30 and 60 seconds after single heel lances (moderate-certainty evidence). Evidence is very uncertain about the effect of sucrose compared to NNS, breastfeeding, laser acupuncture, facilitated tucking, and the effect of sucrose + NNS compared to NNS in reducing pain. Sucrose compared to glucose, expressed breast milk, and skin-to-skin care shows little to no difference in pain scores. Sucrose combined with other nonpharmacologic interventions should be used with caution, given the uncertainty of evidence.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#4536,Effects of acupuncture at acupoints with lower versus higher pain threshold for knee osteoarthritis: a multicenter randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: The acupoint selections impact the effects of acupuncture, and preliminary evidence showed potential connection between pain threshold (PT) and acupuncture response. This study examined whether acupuncture at acupoints with lower PT versus higher PT would yield different effects in patients with knee osteoarthritis (KOA). METHODS: In this multicenter randomized clinical trial, patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive acupuncture at acupoints with lower PT (LPT group), acupuncture at acupoints with higher PT (HPT group), and no acupuncture (waiting-list group). PT was measured with electronic von Frey detector. The primary outcome was the change in WOMAC total score from baseline to 16 weeks, and the secondary outcomes were SF-12 score, and active knee range of motion (ROM). Intention-to-treat analysis was conducted with linear mixed-effect model. RESULTS: Among 666 randomized patients, 625 (93.84%) completed the study. From baseline to 16 weeks, patients in the LPT group versus HPT group had similar effects in reducing WOMAC total score (adjusted mean difference (MD) 2.21, 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.51 to 6.92, P = 0.36), while a greater reduction in WOMAC total score was observed in LPT group (-9.77, 95% CI -14.47 to -5.07, P < 0.001) and HPT group (-11.97, 95% CI -16.71 to -7.24, P < 0.001) compared with waiting-list group. There were no differences in SF-12 score and knee ROM between LPT versus HPT groups. CONCLUSION: Our findings found that the effects of acupuncture at acupoints with lower versus higher PT were similar, both were effective for patients with KOA.

#4549,Therapeutic effects of acupuncture plus fire needle versus acupuncture alone in lateral epicondylitis: A randomized case-control pilot study,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to compare the short-term and intermediate-term efficacy of acupuncture plus fire needle therapy with that of acupuncture alone in the treatment of lateral epicondylitis (LE). METHODS: Thirty-eight patients with LE who had persisted for at least 2 months were enrolled in this prospective, assessor-blinded, randomized controlled pilot trial. Twenty-one patients were randomized to the acupuncture plus fire needle group and 17 to the acupuncture-only group. The primary outcome was the visual analog scale pain score for the previous 24 hours and the secondary outcomes were the maximum grip strength, Patient-rated Forearm Evaluation Questionnaire score, and Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-form Health Survey score. The values at baseline (pretreatment), at the end of treatment, and at 3 months after treatment were used to assess the short-term and intermediate-term effects of treatment. The data were analyzed using the Chi-square test and t test. RESULTS: Within-group analyses showed better results for acupuncture plus fire needle therapy in the short term and intermediate term. Differences in the severity of pain and secondary outcomes were significant in the intermediate term in the acupuncture group. At the end of treatment, none of the differences in outcome scores were significant, except for maximum grip strength in the affected hand in the acupuncture group. No significant between-group differences in short-term or intermediate-term outcomes were observed. CONCLUSION: Acupuncture plus fire needle therapy was effective in the short term in patients seeking improvement of LE. Twelve treatments were effective for relieving pain and improving disability in the intermediate term in patients with chronic LE in both study groups. The findings of the pilot study confirm the feasibility of proceeding to a larger randomized controlled study of the longer-term effects of acupuncture plus fire needle therapy in patients with LE.",No,No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No
#4565,Chinese and Caucasian ocular topography and soft contact lens fit,"BACKGROUND: The aim was to evaluate the effect of ocular topography on soft contact lens fit in Chinese and Caucasians. METHOD: This study evaluated 547 subjects from two ethnic groups, Caucasian (n = 250) and Chinese (n = 297), at investigational sites in three locations: Wenzhou, China, Melbourne, Australia and Jacksonville, USA. Subjects underwent measurement of a range of ocular topographic variables using identical equipment and protocols, including: apical corneal radius (CR), corneal shape factor (CSF) in the two principal meridians, horizontal visible iris diameter (HVID), vertical palpebral aperture (PA), upper lid angle (ULA) and inter-canthal angle (ICA). Subjects were fitted with a spherical lens in two base curves (BCs) (1·Day ACUVUE, 8.50, 9.00 mm) and a toric soft lens (Accelerated Stabilization Design). RESULTS: The steeper base curve (8.50 mm) spherical lenses gave an acceptable overall lens fit with 98 per cent or more of subjects in both groups, while the flatter lens (9.00 mm) was acceptable in a significantly higher proportion of the Chinese compared to Caucasian group (96 versus 82 per cent, p < 0.0001) . The main difference in fit between groups was for centration; there was significantly less decentration with the Chinese group (8.50 BC: 39 versus 72 per cent, p < 0.0001; 9.0 BC: 63 versus. 85 per cent, p = 0.02). The 8.5 mm base curve showed good centration (none or slight decentration) for 97 per cent of Caucasian eyes and 96 per cent of Chinese eyes. With both groups, there were some significant correlations between lens fit and ocular topographic variables, most notable between upper lid angle and toric lens orientation with the Chinese subjects. Regression analysis also showed key predictive values relating to lens fit. CONCLUSIONS: Detailed ocular measurements suggest anatomical differences between Chinese and Caucasian populations that should be considered in soft lens design. The spherical and toric lenses tested in this study fitted a large proportion of both Chinese and Caucasian eyes and are robust to the ocular differences noted.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#4576,Effects of electroacupuncture to the trigeminal nerve area on the autonomic nervous system and cerebral blood flow in the prefrontal cortex,"BACKGROUND: The autonomic nervous system and trigeminal nerve are involved in adjusting flow through diverging cerebral arteries in the prefrontal cortex. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of 100 Hz electroacupuncture (EA) to the trigeminal nerve area on cerebral blood flow and autonomic nervous system function. METHOD: This was a randomised crossover study of 16 healthy volunteers who were assigned to an EA or control group. Stimulation (in the EA group) was performed five times, each after 1 min of rest. Needles were inserted at the inner edge of the eyebrows and 1 cm from the front hairline midpoint. We used high-frequency (HF) and low-frequency (LF) components of heart rate (HR) variability to assess autonomic nervous system function. HF and LF/HF ratio were taken as indicators of parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system activity, respectively. We measured cerebral blood flow using a two-channel near-infrared spectroscope. RESULTS: In the EA group, HR significantly decreased (p=0.004) and HF significantly increased (p=0.006) relative to baseline. By contrast, there were no significant changes in HR or HF within the control group (p>0.05). Accordingly, HR tended to be lower (p=0.087) and HF greater (p=0.071) in the EA group versus the control group. There were no significant differences in LF/HF ratio within/between groups. Compared with the control group, cerebral blood flow was significantly greater in the left (p=0.048) and right (p=0.016) prefrontal cortex in the EA group. CONCLUSIONS: Delivery of 100 Hz EA to the trigeminal nerve area reduces HR and increases parasympathetic nervous activity and cerebral blood flow.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No
#4587,Prevalence and risk factors of Occult Hepatitis C infections in blood donors from Mexico City,"BACKGROUND: The circulatory system is the main mechanism for transmission of the Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). A new class of HCV infections, Occult HCV infection (OCI), is defined as the presence of HCV-RNA in hepatocytes with the absence of HCV in the serum/plasma utilizing current laboratory assays. Different groups have reported the prevalence of OCI; however, its associated risk factors have not been established. In Mexico, there are no reports about OCI, so the objective of our study was to determine the prevalence of OCI in total blood donors in Mexico City, as well as its associated risk factors. METHODS: Blood donors that were considered eligible for donation, according to NOM 253-SSA1-2012, were randomly selected. Demographic data was collected from 1,037 donors. Plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells were assessed for HCV-RNA. The presence of HCV-RNA was determined by nested PCR for the 5'-UTR region. Logistic regression was used to calculate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95%CI) to determine the level of association. RESULTS: The prevalence of OCI was 3.4% among blood donors. Homosexual relationships (OR = 5.52, 95%CI: 1.53-19.92, p<0.05) and acupuncture (OR = 3.56, 95%CI: 1.41-8.98, p<0.05) were significantly associated with OCI. CONCLUSION: There is a significant presence of OCI in the blood donor population in Mexico City. The main risk factors for OCI transmission are homosexual relationships and acupuncture.

#4591,"Neuromodulatory Effect of Sensorimotor Network Functional Connectivity of Temporal Three-Needle Therapy for Ischemic Stroke Patients with Motor Dysfunction: Study Protocol for a Randomized, Patient-Assessor Blind, Controlled, Neuroimaging Trial","BACKGROUND: The clinical efficacy of temporal three-needle therapy for stroke dysfunction has been previously demonstrated in China. However, the central mechanism of temporal three-needle therapy remains unclear. Temporal three-needle projects the sensory cortex and the motor cortex, which may impact the cortex function. Current studies seldom focus on it. Hence, according to the ""scalp-cortex corresponding theory,"" the underlying mechanism of temporal three-needle remains a domain for further research. METHODS: This trial is designed to provide objective and visual evidence for the neuromodulatory effect and neuroimaging mechanism of temporal three-needle therapy for stroke patients. This ongoing study is a prospective, randomized, controlled, patient-assessor blind, single-center, neuroimaging trial involving two-parallel patient groups and a healthy control group. Forty eligible patients will be recruited from Shenzhen Nanshan District People's Hospital and randomized into either the experimental group or the control group. Twenty healthy volunteers will be recruited in the healthy control group and undergo baseline magnetic resonance imaging scans without any intervention. Patients in the control group will receive acupuncture at Dingnieqianxiexian (MS6), in addition to basic medicine and rehabilitative treatments. Patients in the experimental group will receive temporal three-needle therapy plus basic medicine and rehabilitative treatments 5 days per week, 10 sessions over two consecutive weeks. The primary outcome is resting-state functional connectivity, and the secondary outcomes are regional homogeneity, amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations, Fugl-Meyer assessment of the upper limb, and modified Barthel Index. All outcome measures will be assessed at baseline and after 2 weeks of intervention. Discussion. The results will explore the neuromodulatory effects and illustrate the central mechanism of temporal three-needle treatment from the network-level viewpoint of sensorimotor network functional plasticity and promote widespread application in real-world practice.

#4607,Acupuncture and related therapies for anxiety and depression in patients with premature ovarian insufficiency and diminished ovarian reserve: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"BACKGROUND: The decreased ovarian function has a negative impact on the mental health of women and increases the risk of anxiety and depression. A growing number of clinical studies have demonstrated that acupuncture-related therapies can effectively and safely restore hormone levels and improve ovarian reserve function. However, the effectiveness of acupuncture-related therapies in alleviating anxiety and depression symptoms in patients with ovarian hypofunction has not been thoroughly evaluated. Therefore, this study conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the impact of the different acupuncture-related therapies on the mental health of patients with ovarian hypofunction. METHODS: We comprehensively searched eight famous databases for randomized controlled trials up to October 30, 2024. Databases include PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE and Cochrane Library, China Biomedical (CBM), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Database and VIP Database. RESULTS: The study included 12 RCTs, involving 780 patients with ovarian hypofunction, including 403 patients with POI, 297 patients with DOR, and 80 patients with POF. Acupuncture-related therapy was obviously superior to hormone therapy in relieving anxiety symptoms (SMD: -0.90; 95%CI: -1.28, -0.53; P<0.000 01) and depressive symptoms (SMD: -0.82; 95% CI: -1.25, -0.40; P=0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Acupuncture-related therapy was more effective than hormone therapy in improving anxiety and depression symptoms in patients with ovarian hypofunction. This study supports the use of acupuncture-related therapies for women experiencing decreased ovarian function associated with mental health issues.

#4630,Acupuncture for primary dysmenorrhoea: a systematic review,"BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of acupuncture in primary dysmenorrhoea is not fully understood. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of acupuncture for the symptomatic treatment of primary dysmenorrhoea from randomised controlled trials (RCTs). SEARCH STRATEGY: Nineteen electronic databases, including English, Korean, Japanese and Chinese databases, were systematically searched for RCTs investigating acupuncture for primary dysmenorrhoea up to July 2008 with no language restrictions. SELECTION CRITERIA: All RCTs that evaluated the effects of acupuncture compared with controls were included. Studies that assessed the effect of moxibustion or body acupressure were excluded. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The study abstraction and quality assessment of all studies were undertaken following the detailed descriptions of these categories as described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. MAIN RESULTS: Twenty-seven RCTs were systematically reviewed. Only nine of the 27 trials clearly described their methods of randomisation and none of the trials stated the methods of allocation concealment. Compared with pharmacological treatment or herbal medicine, acupuncture was associated with a significant reduction in pain. Three studies reported reduced pain within groups from baseline; however, two RCTs did not find a significant difference between acupuncture and sham acupuncture. AUTHOR'S CONCLUSIONS: The review found promising evidence in the form of RCTs for the use of acupuncture in the treatment of primary dysmenorrhoea compared with pharmacological treatment or herbal medicine. However, the results were limited by methodological flaws. The evidence for the effectiveness of acupuncture for the treatment of primary dysmenorrhoea is not convincing compared with sham acupuncture.

The aim of the study is to systematically evaluate the efficacy and safety of acupuncture for female with infertility and hopefully provide reliable guidance for clinicians and patients. METHODS: We searched digital databases for relevant studies, including EMBASE, PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library up to April 2021, for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effects of acupuncture on women undergoing IVF and other treatment. We included studies with intervention groups using acupuncture and control groups consisting of no acupuncture or sham (placebo) acupuncture. Primary outcomes were clinical pregnancy rate (CPR) and live birth rate (LBR). Meta-regression and subgroup analysis were conducted on the basis of ten prespecified covariates to investigate the variances of the effects of adjuvant acupuncture on pregnancy rates and the sources of heterogeneity. Results: Twenty-seven studies with 7676 participants were included. The results showed that the intervention group contributes more in outcomes including live birth rate (RR = 1.34; 95% CI (1.07, 1.67); P < 0.05), clinical pregnancy rate (RR = 1.43; 95% CI (1.21, 1.69); P < 0.05), biochemical pregnancy rate (RR = 1.42; 95% CI (1.05, 1.91); P < 0.05), ongoing pregnancy rate (RR = 1.25; 95% CI (0.88, 1.79); P < 0.05), adverse events (RR = 1.65; 95% CI (1.15, 2.36); P < 0.05), and implantation rate (MD = 1.19; 95% CI (1.07, 1.33); P < 0.05) when compared with the control group, and the difference is statistically significant. In terms of the number of oocytes retrieved, good-quality embryo rate, miscarriages, and ectopic pregnancy rate, the difference between the acupuncture group and the control group was not statistically significant. Conclusions: Our analysis finds a benefit of acupuncture for outcomes in women with infertility, and the number of acupuncture treatments is a potential influential factor. Given the poor reporting and methodological flaws of existing studies, studies with larger scales and better methodologies are needed to verify these findings. More double-blind RCTs equipped with high quality and large samples are expected for the improvement of the level of evidence.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#4638,Acupuncture effects on in-vitro fertilization pregnancy outcomes: A meta-analysis,"BACKGROUND: The effects of acupuncture on in-vitro fertilization outcomes remain controversial. This study aimed to perform a meta-analysis to assess the effectiveness of acupuncture as an adjuvant therapy to embryo transfer compared to sham-controls or no adjuvant therapy controls on improving pregnancy outcomes in women undergoing in-vitro fertilization. METHODS: A systematic literature search up to January 2021 was performed and 29 studies included 6623 individuals undergoing in-vitro fertilization at the baseline of the study; 3091 of them were using acupuncture as an adjuvant therapy to embryo transfer, 1559 of them were using sham-controls, and 1441 of them were using no adjuvant therapy controls. They reported a comparison between the effectiveness of acupuncture as an adjuvant therapy to embryo transfer compared to sham-controls or no adjuvant therapy controls on improving pregnancy outcomes in women undergoing in-vitro fertilization. Odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated assessing the effectiveness of acupuncture as an adjuvant therapy to embryo transfer compared to sham-controls or no adjuvant therapy controls using the dichotomous method with a random or fixed-effect model. RESULTS: Significantly higher outcomes with acupuncture were observed in biochemical pregnancy (OR, 1.98; 95% CI, 1.55-2.53, p < 0.001); clinical pregnancy (OR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.46-1.98, p < 0.001); ongoing pregnancy (OR, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.41-2.26, p < 0.001); and live birth (OR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.15-2.18, p = 0.005) compared to no adjuvant therapy controls. However, no significant difference were found between acupuncture and no adjuvant therapy controls in miscarriage (OR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.48-1.92, p = 0.91). No significant difference was observed with acupuncture in biochemical pregnancy (OR, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.65-2.08, p = 0.62); clinical pregnancy (OR, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.83-1.54, p = 0.43); ongoing pregnancy (OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.66-1.62, p = 0.87); live birth (OR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.73-1.42, p = 0.90), and miscarriage (OR, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.86-1.55, p = 0.34) compared to sham-controls. CONCLUSIONS: Using acupuncture as an adjuvant therapy to embryo transfer may improve the biochemical pregnancy, clinical pregnancy, ongoing pregnancy, and live birth outcomes compared to no adjuvant therapy controls. However, no significant difference was found between acupuncture as an adjuvant therapy to embryo transfer and sham-controls in any of the measured outcomes. This relationship forces us to recommend the use of acupuncture as adjuvant therapy in women undergoing in-vitro fertilization and inquire further studies comparing acupuncture and sham-controls to reach the best procedure.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#4669,Antidepressant-like effects of acupuncture involved the ERK signaling pathway in rats,"BACKGROUND: The extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway is considered to be associated with the pathogenesis and treatment of depression. Acupuncture has been demonstrated to ameliorate depression-related behavior and promote neurogenesis. In this study, we explored the role of the ERK signaling pathway in the antidepressant-like effects of acupuncture in rats exposed to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS). METHODS: Eighty male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into eight groups: control group, model group, model + Acupuncture group (Acu group), model + fluoxetine group (FLX group), model + DMSO group (DMSO group), model + PD98059 group (PD group), model + Acupuncture + PD98059 group (Acu + PD group) and model + fluoxetine + PD98059 group (FLX + PD group). Except for the control group, all rats were subjected to 3 weeks of CUMS protocols to induce depression. Acupuncture was carried out for 10 min at acupoints of Baihui (GV-20) and Yintang (GV-29) each day during the experimental procedure. The ERK signaling pathway was inhibited using PD98059 through intracerebroventricular injection. The depression-like behaviors were evaluated using the sucrose intake and open-field tests. The protein levels of ERK1/2, phosphor (p)-ERK1/2, cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), p-CREB and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampus were examined using western blot. RESULTS: Acupuncture ameliorated the depression-like behaviors and dysfunction of the ERK signaling pathway in the hippocampus of CUMS rats. PD98059 pretreatment inhibited the improvements brought about by acupuncture on the ERK signaling pathway. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our results indicated that acupuncture had a significant antidepressant-like effect on CUMS-induced depression model rats, and the ERK signaling pathway was implicated in this effect.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#4686,Study of Evodia hot compress plus electro-acupuncture in patients who have undergone abdominal surgery,"BACKGROUND: The importance of postoperative gastrointestinal function recovery is being increasingly recognized. In this multi-center randomized controlled study, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of Evodia hot compress (ECS) plus electro-acupuncture (EA) for patients who developed postoperative gastrointestinal tract dysfunction after abdominal surgery. METHODS: 1009 patients who developed postoperative gastrointestinal tract dysfunction after abdominal surgery were enrolled. All patients received conventional therapies for 7 days from the 1st postoperative day and were randomly assigned to receive coarse salt hot compress, Evodia hot compress or Evodia hot compress plus electro-acupuncture twice a day for 7 days. RESULTS: The mean time to first flatus and to first bowel sounds was comparable among the four groups (P>0.05). The control group had a significantly shorter time to defecation compared with patients receiving coarse salt hot compress, Evodia hot compress or Evodia hot compress plus electro-acupuncture (P<0.05). In patients undergoing open hepatectomy, the time to first defecation was the shortest in those who received Evodia hot compress plus electro-acupuncture (89.3±25.5 h), which was significantly different from that of controls(134±31.1 h), those who received coarse salt hot compress (106.7±36.4 h) and those who received Evodia hot compress (109.9±42.1 h) (P<0.05) in patients undergoingopen cholecystectomy, the time to first defecation was the shortest in those who received Evodia hot compress (73.1± 24.7), which was significantly different from that of controls (77.8±29.7), those who received coarse salt hot compress 90.5±30.2) and those who received Evodia hot compress plus electro-acupunctur (83.9±34.0). CONCLUSION: Evodia hot compress plus electro-acupuncture confers benefit in postoperative recovery of gastrointestinal function of patients who have undergone abdominal surgery and it is overall safe to use.

#4703,Auricular Therapy to Control Pain in Women With Breast Cancer: Protocol for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"BACKGROUND: The increased incidence of breast cancer implies the appearance of frequent symptoms associated with disease and treatments, such as pain. For the management of this issue, auricular therapy has been used in a complementary manner, especially for its safety and analgesic action. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review aims to summarize available evidence on the effects of auricular therapy on pain in women undergoing breast cancer treatment. METHODS: This is a systematic review that includes randomized controlled trials that evaluated the effects of auricular therapy on pain in women with breast cancer, as compared with other interventions (sham or placebo auricular therapy, other nonpharmacological interventions, and routine pain treatments) during the treatment of the disease. Pain, whether induced or not by cancer treatments, is the main outcome to be evaluated. The search for the studies was performed in the following databases: MEDLINE through PubMed, CINAHL, CENTRAL, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, VHL, TCIM Americas Network, CNKI, and Wanfang Data. The reviewers have independently evaluated the full texts, and in the near future, they will extract the data and assess the risk of bias in the included studies. The certainty of the evidence will be assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE), and a meta-analysis will be carried out to evaluate the intervention, considering the homogeneity of the results, using the Cochran Q test and quantified by the Higgins inconsistency index. The guidelines of the PRISMA-P (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols) have been respected in the elaboration of this protocol. RESULTS: The records screening stage has been completed, and the synthesis and meta-analysis were conducted in February 2024. We hope to have finished the preparation of the paper for publication by September 2024. Review reporting will follow standard guidelines for reporting systematic reviews. The results will be published in peer-reviewed scientific journals. CONCLUSIONS: This review will compile the strength of evidence for the use of auricular therapy in the management of pain in women with breast cancer during the treatment of the disease, identifying gaps in the available evidence as well as assisting health professionals in indicating the intervention for clinical practice.

#4709,Development of a fertility acupuncture protocol: defining an acupuncture treatment protocol to support and treat women experiencing conception delays,"BACKGROUND: The influence of acupuncture on female fertility is of interest to people in clinical practice and acupuncture researchers. Despite developing research in the field, there is a marked absence of research defining an adequate treatment to support and treat women experiencing delays in conceiving. OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to develop a consensus among acupuncture fertility specialists on what is adequate acupuncture treatment to promote female fertility in the periconception period; to examine what acupuncturists do in a consultation; to examine their actions and their exchanges with their patients; and to finalize an acupuncture intervention for a clinical trial of fertility problems. DESIGN AND SUBJECTS: An online consensus-building technique was used among acupuncturists who are recognized experts in the field of women's reproductive health. The 10 subjects were selected on the basis of their published work with respect to treating female fertility problems or on the recommendation of researchers who had published articles in this discipline. All 10 subjects currently, or until recently, treated (some exclusively) women facing fertility problems using acupuncture as one of the modalities to address these problems. RESULTS: Although the participants were relatively diverse, a consensus emerged regarding the best way to provide acupuncture to women with fertility problems. Along the way, a rich vein of qualitative data emerged about the way in which acupuncture is applied. These data included, for example, the high value placed on differential diagnosis and the importance of the practitioner-patient relationship for the therapeutic outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Consensus building among experts provides a transparent method of protocol development suited to acupuncture research that will then hold relevance to clinical practice.",Yes,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#4726,Double blinding with a new placebo needle: a further validation study,"BACKGROUND: The masking properties of a new, non-penetrating, double-blind placebo acupuncture needle were demonstrated. Practitioners correctly identified some of the needles; if they were confident in this opinion, they would be unblinded. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clues that led to correct identification, and the confidence in this decision. METHODS: Ten acupuncture practitioners, blindly and randomly, applied 10 each of three types of needle to the shoulder: blunt, non-penetrating needles that pressed the skin ('skin-touch placebo needle'); new non-penetrating needles that penetrated soft material (stuffing) but did not reach the skin ('non-touch control needle'); matching penetrating needles. Afterwards, practitioners were asked to judge the type of needle, their confidence in their decision and what clues led them to their judgements. RESULTS: Of the 30 judgements made by each practitioner, the mean number of correct, incorrect and unidentifiable answers were 10.4 (SD 3.7), 15.2 (SD 4.9) and 4.4 (SD 6.1), respectively. There was no significant difference in the confidence scores for 104 correct (mean, 54.0 (SD 20.2)%) and 152 incorrect (mean, 50.3 (SD 24.3)%) judgements. Twelve needles were identified with 100% confidence-three correct, and nine incorrect. For needles correctly identified, the proportions of non-touch (p = 0.14) and skin-touch (p = 0.17), needles were no greater than chance, but the proportion of penetrating needles correctly identified exceeded chance (p < 0.01). 53% of judgements were made from the ""feeling of needle insertion"", but 57% of these were wrong. CONCLUSION: Practitioners had a slight tendency to guess the penetrating needles correctly, but were uncertain about most of their judgments, posing only a very small risk to double blinding.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#4731,Performance of GPT-4 for planning acupuncture treatment: comparison with human clinician performance,"BACKGROUND: The medical knowledge of GPT-4 has been evaluated on patient data, providing diagnostic and treatment suggestions. However, few studies have directly compared the clinical suggestions of GPT-4 with those of groups of practitioners. METHODS: This study assessed the ability of GPT-4 to make medical decisions regarding acupuncture treatment by comparing its selection of acupoints with those made by human clinicians. Ten case reports published in Korean medical journals were selected and put in a standardized format. The standardized patient information was given to 80 Korean Medicine doctors and GPT-4 to diagnose and prescribe three to five acupoints per case. To evaluate the performance of GPT-4, the similarities in acupoint selection between the doctors and GPT-4 were quantified based on the percentage overlap and correlations of the selection probabilities of acupoints in each case. RESULTS: The average percentage overlap for acupoints among cases at the 10% cutoff was 51.3%, i.e., more than half of the GPT-4 acupoint suggestions overlapped the acupoints selected by the doctors. In half of the cases, significant correlations were observed in the acupoint selection probabilities, implying that GPT-4 acupoint suggestions are similar to those of doctors. CONCLUSIONS: GPT-4 made reasonable acupoint suggestions, with notable overlap observed with the prescriptions of doctors. This shows its promise for supporting medical decisions, education, and personalized medicine for patients undergoing acupuncture treatment. Future studies and validation are necessary to ensure the reliability and efficacy of applying GPT-4 in real-world settings.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#4733,Effect of electroacupuncture on diabetic neurogenic bladder: A randomized controlled trial protocol,"BACKGROUND: The most common and bothersome lower urinary tract complication of diabetes mellitus is diabetic neurogenic bladder (DNB). Acupuncture has certain advantages in treating bladder dysfunction including urinary retention and incontinence. Therefore, we think that electroacupuncture (EA) may be beneficial to DNB patients. However, it is not clear whether EA combined with basic western medicine could optimize the therapeutic effect for DNB. METHOD/DESIGN: This is a sham-controlled, patient-blinded, pioneer randomized controlled trial (RCT). One hundred fifty eligible patients will be randomly divided into 3 groups: A. basic western medicine (BWC), B. EA with BWC, C. sham EA with BWC. EA treatment will be given twice a week for 12 weeks at bilateral BL23, BL32, BL33, and BL35. The BWC group will received Alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) and methylcobalamin (MC) treatment for 12 weeks, 2 treatment sessions per week. The primary outcome is scored by the 72-hour bladder diary (72h-BD). The secondary outcomes will be scored by the American Urological Association symptom index (AUA-SI), Post-void residual urine volume (PVR) and urodynamic tests. All the assessments will be conducted at baseline and the 12th weeks after the intervention starts. The follow-up assessments will be performed with 72h-BD and AUA-SI in the 4th, 12th, and 24th weeks after intervention ends. DISCUSSION: This trial protocol provides an example of the clinical application acupuncture treatment in the management of DNB. This RCT will provide us information on the effect of treating DNB patients with only acupuncture, western medicine therapy (ALA + MC) as well as the combination of both. The additive effect or synergistic effect of acupuncture and basic western medicine will then be analyzed.

#4741,A randomised controlled trial: can acupuncture reduce drug requirement during analgosedation with propofol and alfentanil for colonoscopy? A study protocol,"BACKGROUND: The number of colonoscopies tremendously increased in recent years and will further rise in the near future. Because of patients' growing expectation on comfort during medical procedures, it is not surprising that the demand for sedation also expands. Propofol in combination with alfentanil is known to provide excellent analgosedation, however, its use is associated with respiratory and cardiovascular depression. Acupuncture could be a technique to reduce drug requirement while providing the same level of sedation and analgesia. METHODS/DESIGN: The study will be performed as a single centre, randomised, placebo controlled trial. 153 patients scheduled for propofol/alfentanil sedation during colonoscopy will be randomly assigned to receive electroacupuncture (P6, ST36, LI4), sham acupuncture, or placebo acupuncture. Following endoscopy patients and gastroenterologists have to fill in questionnaires about their sedation experiences. Additionally, patients have to accomplish the Trieger test before and after the procedure. Patient monitoring includes time adapted HR, SpO2, ECG, NIBP, exCO2, OAA/S, and the Aldrete score. The primary outcome parameter is the dosage of propofol necessary for an adequate level of sedation to tolerate the procedure (OAA/S < 4). Effectiveness of sedation, classified by satisfaction levels measured by questionnaires is the secondary outcome parameter. DISCUSSION: Moderate to deep sedation using propofol is increasingly applied during colonoscopies with a high satisfaction level among patients despite well-known hemodynamic and respiratory side effects of this hypnotic agent. Acupuncture is known to attenuate gastrointestinal discomfort and pain. We hypothesize that the combination of conventional sedation techniques with acupuncture may result in equally satisfied patients with a lower risk of respiratory and hemodynamic events during colonoscopies.

#4748,Perioperative Pain Observation of Hip Fracture Surgery Patients with Cheek Acupuncture,"BACKGROUND: The objective of this study is to investigate the impact of cheek acupuncture on perioperative pain in patients with hip fracture. METHODS: A random number table was utilized to allocate the patients into three distinct cohorts: Only spinal anesthesia was performed (group S), cheek acupuncture was performed before spinal anesthesia (group C), and ultrasound-guided fascia iliaca block was performed before spinal anesthesia (group F). The primary outcome measure was the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score within 24 hours post-surgery, as well as the level of beta-endorphin. The secondary outcome measures included intraoperative mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), length of hospital stay, postoperative complications, levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), and degree of motor block. RESULTS: Compared to Group S, patients in group C and group F exhibited significantly lower Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scores at the following endpoints: when the patient is positioned in the spinal anesthesia position (T(2)); 12 hours post-surgery (T(5)); and 24 hours post-surgery (T(6)). And patients in group C and group F demonstrated a decreased beta-endorphin level at the T(6). Compared to Group S, patients in group C and group F displayed reduced Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) levels at T(2). CONCLUSION: The application of cheek acupuncture therapy in hip fracture surgery can effectively reduce the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) score, enhance perioperative safety, facilitate postoperative recovery, and optimize the overall medical experience for patients.

#4765,Change in the P300 index - a pilot randomized controlled trial of low-frequency electrical stimulation of acupuncture points in middle-aged men and women,"BACKGROUND: The P300 is a major index used to evaluate improvements in brain function. Although a few studies have reported evaluating the effectiveness of manual acupuncture or electro-acupuncture by monitoring the P300, research in this field is not yet very active. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of periodic low-frequency electrical stimulation applied to BL62 and KI6 on brain activity by analyzing the P300. METHOD: The study was conducted as a randomized double-blind test of 55 subjects in their 50s, including 26 males and 29 females. Each subject received 12 sessions of stimulation over a one-month period. In each session, low-frequency electrical stimulation at an average of 24 μA and 2 Hz was applied to the acupuncture points BL62 and KI6, and event-related potentials (ERPs) were measured before the first session and after the last session of the electrical stimulation. RESULTS: The results of a chi-square test indicated that the double-blind test was conducted correctly. Compared to the Sham group, all the subjects in the Real stimulation group showed a tendency toward a decreasing P300 latency and increasing P300 amplitude after all 12 sessions of stimulation. In the women, the amplitude significantly increased at Fz, Fcz, Cz, Cpz, and Pz. CONCLUSIONS: With this experiment, the low-frequency electrical stimulation of two acupuncture points (BL62 and K16) was confirmed to have a positive influence on the prevention of natural cerebral aging.

#4766,The effect of acupuncture on pain score after open kidney surgery,"BACKGROUND: The pain after nephrectomy, just as any other surgery, is one of the problems that surgeons confront. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relieving effect of acupuncture on the pain experienced after nephrectomy. METHODS: This was a clinical trial that was performed on 30 patients with mean age of 40.8 ± 12.54 who were candidates for nephrectomy. After matching for gender and age, the patients were divided into either acupuncture or control group. In acupuncture group, four points were stimulated for 30 minutes, and in control group, other points were stimulated ineffectively for 30 min. Then, the pain experienced in the first six hours after the surgery was registered by a blind observer based on visual analog scale. Data were analyzed using SPSS software and the t-test. RESULTS: Our results showed that the severity of pain in the acupuncture group was significantly lower than that in the control group. Also, there were six patients who required opioids in the acupuncture group, but there were 12 such patients in the control group. The mean opiate used in the control group was significantly greater than the mean for the acupuncture group.

#4792,"Effectiveness and safety of electrical moxibustion for knee osteoarthritis: A multicenter, randomized, assessor-blinded, parallel-group clinical trial","BACKGROUND: The prevalence of knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is increasing, and it has emerged as a major health issue. Studies have been reported that moxibustion is effective for treating KOA, but conventional moxibustion is difficult to control the intensity of stimulation and causes smoke, harmful gases, or odors. An electrical moxibustion (EM) device was developed to solve these problems, so we conducted this study to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of EM as a treatment for KOA. METHODS: This is a multicenter, randomized, assessor-blinded, parallel-group clinical trial. Participants with KOA were randomly allocated into EM, traditional indirect moxibustion (TIM), or usual care groups. The moxibustion groups were received 12 sessions of moxibustion treatment at six acupuncture points (ST36, ST35, ST34, SP9, EX-LE4, SP10) over a period of 6 weeks. The usual care group was received usual treatment and self-care. The primary outcome was the degree of pain measured by numerical rating scale (NRS). The second outcomes were measured using visual analog scale, Korean version of the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities osteoarthritis index, patient global assessment, European quality of life five dimension five level scale, and warm sense threshold and heat pain threshold. For safety assessment, laboratory test and adverse events (AEs) were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 138 participants were assigned. While there was no significant NRS change in the usual care, EM and TIM showed significant decrease after treatment. Compared to the usual care, the mean change of NRS in the EM and TIM was significantly different, but there was no significance between two groups. Regarding secondary outcomes, EM and TIM also showed significant difference compared to the usual care, but there was no significance between two groups. Regarding safety assessment, while usual care showed significant safety among three groups, EM showed seven treatment-related AEs by four participants compared TIM's 10 events by 10 participants. In addition, there was no blister caused by burns in the EM, which occurred four cases in the TIM.

#4799,Comparison of vibro-acoustic stimulation and acupressure effects in nonstress test results and its parameters in pregnant women,"BACKGROUND: The primary goal of antenatal testing is to identify fetuses at risk of intrauterine neurologic injury or death so that these adverse outcomes can be prevented. We want to assess nonstress test (NST) results and some parameters before and after vibro-acoustic stimulation and acupressure. We did a randomized controlled clinical trial in Shahid-Beheshti Hospital in Isfahan in 2011. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 64 pregnant women (32-36 weeks) in prenatal care unit were selected for vibro-acoustic stimulation (n = 32) and acupressure (n = 32) during the second NST. The statistical processing was performed by descriptive, paired t-test, analysis of variance (ANOVA), chi-square, and McNemar test through SPSS version 20. RESULTS: The mean baseline fetal heart rate (FHR) in vibro-acoustic and acupressure groups before and after stimulations did not differ significantly. The mean time of first acceleration in vibro-acoustic group was decreased after stimulations significantly, but in the acupressure group it did not differ statistically. The numbers of accelerations in both groups did not differ significantly before and after stimulation. The mean time of second acceleration in the vibro-acoustic group was 6.7 min before stimulation and 3.9 min after stimulation. This decrease was significant. The mean time of second acceleration after stimulation was lower than before significantly in the acupressure group. The frequency of reactive NST was same in both groups, before and after stimulation. CONCLUSION: Vibro-acoustic stimulation and acupressure of acupoint BL67 did not change FHR parameters but they could decrease the time of reactive result of NST.",No,No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No
#4823,"Use of alternative therapies in older outpatients in the United States and Japan: prevalence, reporting patterns, and perceived effectiveness","BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence, patterns of reporting, and perceived effectiveness of alternative medical therapies (ATs) among older white American, African American, and Japanese outpatients. METHODS: This study used a questionnaire to interview participants (N = 593; age, >59 y), who were outpatients of geriatric outpatient clinics in Saint Louis, Missouri, and Tokyo, Japan (white Americans, n = 180; African Americans, n = 106; and Japanese, n = 307). RESULTS: Use of >1 AT was greatest among older Japanese (74.3%), followed by white Americans (61.1%) and African Americans (47.2%; p <.001). The most common ATs used among the Japanese (and significantly more than the white and African American groups) were lifestyle diet, herbal therapy, massage, acupressure, and acupuncture. The white and African American groups were more frequent users of relaxation techniques and spiritual healing compared with the Japanese group. Contrary to prior studies of the general population, the use of >1 AT did not correlate with any sociodemographic variables. Reported use of ATs to doctors was low but similar in all three groups (white Americans = 48%, African Americans = 42%, and Japanese = 46%). Perceived effectiveness was high but similar in all three groups (white Americans = 85%, African Americans = 92%, and Japanese = 84%). Although chronic conditions were common reasons for use of ATs, nonmedical reasons (e.g., general health or religious reasons) were also common. CONCLUSIONS: Use of ATs was greater in Japan than in the United States, but for both countries, use by older persons was greater than previous reports of the general population. Because sociodemographic variables do not predict use, and reported use to doctors is low and perceived effectiveness is high, increased awareness and understanding about ATs by health care professionals seems imperative.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#4836,Defining the quality of acupuncture: the case of acupuncture for cancer-related fatigue,"BACKGROUND: The quality and dose of acupuncture used in a clinical trial affects the outcome, as with the quality and dose of any intervention. The dose of acupuncture treatment may be characterized by the frequency of treatment, needle type and depth, length of needle retention, point selection, and combination. The dose in trials of acupuncture has at times been described as low or inappropriate but is seldom assessed in systematic reviews of acupuncture trials. This article examines the research evaluating acupuncture for cancer-related fatigue to determine what characteristics of treatment may contribute to a quality acupuncture intervention. METHODOLOGY: English and Chinese language databases were searched from inception to December 2013 for randomized controlled trials of acupuncture for the treatment of cancer-related fatigue. Assessment of the quality of the acupuncture intervention was undertaken using the domains and items from the NICMAN framework. RESULTS: Seven studies with a total of 690 patients were included. Four of the studies were designed as feasibility or pilot studies, and the other 3 studies were described as ""effectiveness"" trials. The treatment paradigm for the active intervention was based on traditional Chinese medicine in all studies, yet few of the studies were explicit as to how the active intervention was justified within a traditional Chinese medicine paradigm. Acupuncture point prescriptions were developed by a small consensus panel or based on typical points and/or ""clinical experience."" No discussion of traditional Chinese medicine theory or literature review was reported in any studies. Acupuncture point location was adequately described in 4 of the 7 studies. Frequency of treatment was twice per week in 2 studies; all others were once per week. Two studies did not apply needle manipulation or stimulation, and no justification was given. CONCLUSION: The 7 trials reviewed meet some criteria for a quality acupuncture intervention. However, frequently elements of the intervention were not addressed, and it is possible that the dosage trialed was suboptimal. Systematic reviews of acupuncture are likely to continue to be inconclusive while comparisons are conducted of heterogeneous interventions without providing.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#4842,[Complementary and alternative procedures for fibromyalgia syndrome : Updated guidelines 2017 and overview of systematic review articles],"BACKGROUND: The regular update of the guidelines on fibromyalgia syndrome, AWMF number 145/004, was scheduled for April 2017. METHODS: The guidelines were developed by 13 scientific societies and 2 patient self-help organizations coordinated by the German Pain Society. Working groups (n =8) with a total of 42 members were formed balanced with respect to gender, medical expertise, position in the medical or scientific hierarchy and potential conflicts of interest. A search of the literature for systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials of complementary and alternative therapies from December 2010 to May 2016 was performed in the Cochrane library, MEDLINE, PsycINFO and Scopus databases. Levels of evidence were assigned according to the classification system of the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine version 2009. The strength of recommendations was formed by multiple step formalized procedures to reach a consensus. Efficacy, risks, patient preferences and applicability of available therapies were weighed up against each other. The guidelines were reviewed and approved by the board of directors of the societies engaged in the development of the guidelines. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Meditative movement therapies (e.g. qi gong, tai chi and yoga) are strongly recommended. Acupuncture and weight reduction in cases of obesity can be considered.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#4848,Multi-Spatial Voxel-Scale Modulation of Acupuncture on Abnormal Brain Activity in Migraine Patients Without Aura: A Randomized Study Neuroimaging Trial,"BACKGROUND: The role of acupuncture in treating migraine has been widely recognized, but the systematic, comprehensive and, multi-spatial voxel-scale mechanism of brain function changes is still unclear. OBJECTIVE: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) was used to investigate the modulatory effect of acupuncture on brain activity in patients with migraine without aura (MwoA) at different spatial voxel scales. METHODS: A total of 64 patients with MwoA were randomized into true acupuncture (TA) and sham acupuncture (SA) groups. MwoA patients received TA or SA three times a week for four weeks, a total of 12 sessions. A clinical symptoms assessment and rs-fMRI scans were evaluated before and after four weeks of treatment. Amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and fractional ALFF (fALFF), regional homogeneity (ReHo), and degree centrality (DC) were used to evaluate the spontaneous activity, activity coherence and connectivity importance of brain function at the single voxel, local voxel, and global voxel scales, respectively. RESULTS: The clinical symptoms of both groups were improved compared with baseline. There were significant differences between the TA group and the SA group in migraine frequency, days and pain intensity. The neuroimaging data suggest that TA modulates a broader and more significant brain neural activity than SA. TA modulates the neural activity of the default mode network (DMN), visual network (VN), and sensorimotor network (SMN) at the single voxel scale, local voxel scale and global voxel scale, and these changes are correlated with the improvement of the migraine and quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: TA could exert therapeutic effects at different spatial voxel scales by modulating the DMN, VN, and SMN, which may be the neuroimaging mechanism of acupuncture for MwoA.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes

#4875,Acupuncture in Pediatrics: A Scoping Review,"Background: The use of acupuncture for common pediatric conditions continues to grow in the United States. Six previous reviews have summarized the research; however, approximately 8 years have accumulated adding to this growing body of literature. Objectives: The aim of this article is to provide a scoping review of acupuncture research in pediatric conditions and a summary of the effectiveness of acupuncture in the pediatric population. Methods: A systematic search was performed to identify clinical trials and reviews published between August 2015 and October 2023. Trials and reviews were excluded if they were not: (1) acupuncture specific, (2) data limited to pediatric patients, and (3) published in English. The literature was assessed and synthesized into a scoping review and commentary. Results: Seventy-one publications were identified (42 clinical trials and 29 reviews) that represented 17 conditions and 10 countries; the top 2 were China and the United States. The top five areas of new research (based on numbers of clinical trials) are pain, cerebral palsy (CP), attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder, and nausea and vomiting. Conclusions: Clinical trials in pediatric acupuncture represent a small but important subset of acupuncture literature. Data are positive for postoperative nausea and vomiting and promising for CP, nocturnal enuresis, perioperative pain, procedural pain, and tic disorders. Several factors preclude additional firm conclusions from being drawn, including a limited number of trials, small sample size (n < 100) of the majority of randomized controlled trials (78.6%), and heterogeneity of treatment approaches. Continued research on the use of acupuncture for pediatric conditions is warranted, particularly in conditions demonstrating recent promising evidence.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#4903,Stuck-moving needle acupuncture myofascial trigger point to treat idiopathic frozen shoulder: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: There are evidence for the efficacy of acupuncture treatment for chronic shoulder pain, however, it remains unclear the best acupuncture modes for effective treatment. We compared the effect of the myofascial trigger point (MTrp) stuck-moving needle acupuncture with that of common acupuncture treatments. Further, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of stuck-moving needle acupuncture for the MTrp in improving pain and range of motions in patients with idiopathic frozen shoulder. The aim of present study is to select an effective therapy for patients with idiopathic frozen shoulder. METHODS: Randomized controlled trial will be conducted in the three clinical centers of Qingyang Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital, Qingyang Xifeng district People's Hospital, and Qingyang Second People's Hospital in China from February 2020 to January 2021. One hundred and eight frozen shoulder patients will be recruited and randomized into one of three groups in a 1:1:1 ratio of the stuck-moving needle acupuncture group, common acupuncture control group, and physical exercise control group. This trial will include a 1-week baseline period, a 3-week treatment period, and a 12-week follow-up period. During the 3 weeks of the treatment period, patients will receive nine sessions of acupuncture. The primary outcome will be related to change in the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and measurement of range of joint motion (ROM) from the baseline period to the 12-week follow-up period. Secondary outcome measures will include measurement of pressure pain threshold (PPT), pressure pain tolerance (PTT), Oxford Shoulder Score (OSS), 36-item short form survey, and patient satisfaction evaluation. Adverse events also will be recorded for safety assessment. DISCUSSION: The results of this trial will allow us to compare the difference in efficacy between stuck-moving needle acupuncture MTrP with that of common acupuncture treatments. The findings from this trial will be published in the peer-reviewed journals.

#4934,East Asian Herbal Medicine Combined with Conventional Therapy for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,"BACKGROUND: There is an increasing demand to improve personal health and reduce the social burden in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). A comprehensive review of ASD interventions from the point of view of efficacy, safety, and compliance is needed. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of East Asian Herbal Medicine (EAHM) in the treatment of ASD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eleven databases (PubMed, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, EMBASE, KISS, RISS, OASIS, KCI, CNKI, Wanfang data, and CiNii) were searched from their respective inception to July 2021. A search was conducted by combining the keywords Autism Spectrum Disorder and Herbal medicine. We included a randomized controlled trial in which oral administration of EAHM was combined with conventional treatment for pediatric ASD patients. The primary outcomes were the clinical efficacy rate and the improvement in Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) score. RESULTS: A total of 7 studies involving 462 children with ASD were included. The results suggest that EAHM as part of a combined therapy enhances the CARS score (MD[95% confidential interval]=4.47[5.89,3.05], p&lt;0.01) and the clinical efficacy rate (RR=1.31[1.14,1.51], p&lt;0.01) in comparison to the control group using only conventional therapy. Safety information was reported in 4 of the 7 included studies, and there were no adverse events or the difference in the incidence of side effects between the two groups was not significant. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis shows that EAHM may improves the clinical efficacy rate and CARS score in children with ASD. However, in that the quality of the included studies is not generally high and the numbers are difficult to be considered sufficient, larger scale and rigorously designed randomized controlled trials need to be conducted to strengthen the evidence.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#4949,Acupuncture for depression,"BACKGROUND: There is interest from the community in the use of self help and complementary therapies for depression. This review examined the currently available evidence supporting the use of acupuncture to treat depression. OBJECTIVES: To examine the effectiveness and adverse effects of acupuncture in the treatment for depression. SEARCH STRATEGY: The following databases were searched: CCDAN-CTR, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (1966 to Dec 2008), EMBASE (1980 to Dec 2008), PSYCINFO (1874 to Dec 2008), the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE), CINAHL (1980 to Dec 2008), Wan Fang database (to Dec 2008). The following terms were used: depression, depressive disorder, dysthymic disorder and acupuncture. SELECTION CRITERIA: Inclusion criteria included all published and unpublished randomised controlled trials comparing acupuncture with sham acupuncture, no treatment, pharmacological treatment, other structured psychotherapies (cognitive behavioural therapy, psychotherapy or counselling), or standard care. The following modes of treatment were included: acupuncture, electro acupuncture or laser acupuncture. The participants included adult men and women with depression defined by clinical state description, or diagnosed by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-IV), Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDC), International Classification of Disease (ICD) or the Criteria for Classification and Diagnosis of Mental Diseases CCMD-3-R. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Meta-analyses were performed using relative risk for dichotomous outcomes and standard mean differences for continuous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals. Primary outcomes were reduction in the severity of depression, measured by self rating scales, or by clinician rated scales and an improvement in depression defined as remission versus no remission. MAIN RESULTS: This review is an update and now contains data from 30 studies. Following recent searches, 23 new studies have been added and a further 11 trials were excluded (due to suboptimal doses of medication, no clinical outcomes, insufficient reporting). Thirty trials with 2,812 participants are included in the meta-analysis.There was a high risk of bias in the majority of trials. There was insufficient evidence of a consistent beneficial effect from acupuncture compared with a wait list control or sham acupuncture control. Two trials found acupuncture may have an additive benefit when combined with medication compared with medication alone. A subgroup of participants with depression as a co-morbidity experienced a reduction in depression with manual acupuncture compared with SSRIs (RR 1.66, 95%CI 1.03, 2.68) (three trials, 94 participants). The majority of trials compared manual and electro acupuncture with medication and found no effect between groups. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We found insufficient evidence to recommend the use of acupuncture for people with depression. The results are limited by the high risk of bias in the majority of trials meeting inclusion criteria.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#4956,Comparison of the efficacy and safety of acupuncture and acupotomy for patients with cervical spondylotic radiculopathy: A protocol for systematic review and meta-analysis,"BACKGROUND: There is no systematic review to compare the efficacy of acupuncture and acupotomy in patients with cervical spondylotic radiculopathy. It is worthy to critically review the evidence of the comparison of these 2 therapies to inform clinical practice. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of acupuncture and acupotomy in the treatment of cervical spondylotic radiculopathy and to provide evidence for clinical practice. METHODS: Seven electronic databases including Web of Science, Embase, PubMed, Wanfang Data, Scopus, Science Direct, Cochrane Library were searched in March 2021 by 2 independent reviewers. Data extraction was performed independently, and any conflict was resolved before final analysis. Only randomized clinical trials were included in this study. Outcomes included pain intensity, symptom score, neck disability index, total effective rate, and curative rate. The Cochrane risk of bias tool is used to evaluate the risk of bias of included randomized controlled trials by 2 independent reviewers. RESULTS: We hypothesized that these 2 methods would provide similar therapeutic benefits. The results of this research will be delivered in a peer-reviewed journal. CONCLUSION: This study expects to provide credible and scientific clinical evidence for the efficacy and safety of acupuncture and acupotomy in the treatment of cervical spondylotic radiculopathy.

#4960,Impact of acupressure on onset of labour and labour duration: A systematic review,"BACKGROUND: There is worldwide concern with increasing rates of pharmacologically induced labour and operative birth. Many women would like to avoid medical or surgical interventions in childbirth; a desire that may contribute towards the popularity of complementary and alternative medicine/therapies. METHOD: This systematic review examines the effects of acupressure on labour onset and duration of labour. We searched MEDLINE, CINAHL, AMED, Cochrane Collaboration, and Science Direct from 1999 to 2013 for published randomised controlled trials and controlled trials comparing acupressure with placebo and no treatment. Studies recruited primiparous and/or multiparous women with either spontaneous or induced onset of labour. The outcome measures were labour onset and duration of all stages of labour. FINDINGS: Seven trials with data reporting on 748 women using different acupressure points and methods of administration were included in the review. One study examined the initiation of labour and six studies examined labour duration and/or pain levels. The two most studied acupoints were Sanyinjiao/Spleen 6 and Hegu/Large Intestine 4. Results suggest acupressure may reduce the length of labour particularly in the first stage. CONCLUSION: Further research is required on whether acupressure can shorten labour duration, augment prolonged labour or initiate onset of labour by stimulating uterine contractions. Clinical trials should report the basis for acupressure treatment described in the STRICTA (minus needling) and CONSORT non-pharmaceutical guidelines.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#4973,Acupuncture for induction of labour,"BACKGROUND: This is one of a series of reviews of methods of cervical ripening and labour induction using standardised methodology. The use of complementary therapies is increasing and some women look to complementary therapies during pregnancy and childbirth to be used alongside conventional medical practice. Acupuncture involves the insertion of very fine needles into specific points of the body. The limited observational studies to date suggest acupuncture for induction of labour appears safe, has no known teratogenic effects, and may be effective. The evidence regarding the clinical effectiveness of this technique is limited. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effects of acupuncture for third trimester cervical ripening or induction of labour. SEARCH STRATEGY: The Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register (February 2003), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2003), PubMed (1966 to present), CISCOM (1960 to present), EMBASE (1980 to present) and bibliographies of relevant papers. SELECTION CRITERIA: Clinical trials comparing acupuncture used for third trimester cervical ripening or labour induction with placebo/no treatment or other methods listed above it on a predefined list of labour induction methods. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: A strategy was developed to deal with the large volume and complexity of trial data relating to labour induction. This involved a two-stage method of data extraction. MAIN RESULTS: One trial of 56 women was included in the review. Data were not in a form that could be included in the meta-analysis. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: There is a need for well-designed randomised controlled trials to evaluate the role of acupuncture to induce labour and for trials to assess clinically meaningful outcomes.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#4987,"Experiences of acupuncturists in a placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial","BACKGROUND: This paper describes the experiences of 8 licensed acupuncturists in a placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial (RCT). This information is important to the design and conduct of high-quality trials. METHODS: We conducted a RCT (N=135) with a 2-week placebo run-in followed by 4 weeks of twice-weekly treatments comparing genuine to sham acupuncture (using the Streitberger placebo needle) in the treatment of arm pain caused by repetitive use. At the end of this study, we conducted written structured interviews with 8 participating acupuncturists. The acupuncturists were not aware of the study's results at the time of these interviews. The questions focused on their experiences in the study, adherence to study protocols, their thoughts about the technical and ethical issues involved in using a sham needling device, and their expectations of trial outcomes. The questions were motivated by expressions of concerns the acupuncturists raised in feedback groups during the course of the study, and our desire to improve further trials. RESULTS: The acupuncturists differed widely in their comfort levels with the research methods used, their adherence to the study protocol, and their expectations of trial outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that careful monitoring of acupuncturists, including observation of treatments and frequent meetings to support them throughout the trial, is necessary to maintain a high degree of quality control.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#5020,Correlation of electrical conductance in meridian and autonomic nervous activity after auricular acupressure in middle-aged women,"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to examine the correlation of heart rate variability (HRV) and meridian electrical conductance among middle-aged women during an 8-week period of auricular acupressure (AA) treatment for weight reduction. METHODS: Sixty (60) subjects were randomized either to a control group (n=30) or to a treatment group with AA (n=30). Anthropometric parameters, HRV indices, and meridian levels were measured before treatment, at the 5th week, and 1 week after the 8-week treatment period. RESULTS: Although no significant changes were observed in body weight (BW) and body-mass index (BMI) from baseline to 1 week after AA treatment, a significant decrease in Waist Circumference (WC) was observed in the acupressure group. In contrast, the subjects' BW, BMI, and WC were significantly increased from baseline to the 9th week in the control group. With adjustment for baseline low frequencies (LF) of HRV, the LF at the 5th and 9th weeks in the acupressure groups was generally lower than that in the control group, with a p-value=0.027 using the mixed linear model. The meridian levels for Spleen, Bladder, and Gallbladder were significantly lower in the group subjected to acupressure than in the control group at the 5th week. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study indicate that AA tends to inactivate the sympathetic nervous activity demonstrated by both HRV and meridian electrical conductance changes. As a result, AA may modulate the autonomic nervous system to exert its physiological effect through the pathway of the meridian system.",No,No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No

METHODS: Computer searches of the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, PubMed, Embase, Chinese Biomedical Literature (CBM) Database, Wanfang database, Wipu (VIP) database, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) database for published randomized controlled trial (RCT) studies on Jingjin acupuncture treatment of cerebral palsy from the beginning of the database construction until 30 November 2023 were performed, and the quality of the papers was assessed through independent data extraction by two individuals and then meta-analyzed using RevMan5.4 software. A total of 20 RCTs involving 1,453 patients were included. RESULTS: The overall effective rate of Jingjin acupuncture therapy was better than that of conventional therapy, with a combined odds ratio (OR) of 4.70 and a 95% confidence interval (CI) of [3.05, 7.24]. The Modified Ashworth Spasticity (MAS) Scale, Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM), Fine Motor Function Measure (FMFM), and Comprehensive Spasticity Scale (CSS) scores are superior to conventional therapy. CONCLUSION: Jingjin acupuncture therapy is effective in treating spastic cerebral palsy and has better overall efficacy than conventional therapy.

#5069,"Electroacupuncture versus sham electroacupuncture for urinary retention in poststroke patients: study protocol for a multicenter, randomized controlled trial","BACKGROUND: This study protocol evaluates the effectiveness of adjuvant electroacupuncture (EA) for urinary retention in poststroke patients undergoing conventional treatments, in comparison with that of a sham control. METHODS/DESIGN: A multicenter, blinded, randomized controlled trial will be conducted in three hospitals in the Republic of Korea. We are recruiting 54 stroke survivors (aged >19 years), who were diagnosed with urinary retention based on the results of two consecutive post-void residual (PVR) tests, and dividing them randomly into two arms: the EA and Park-sham control groups. They will receive ten sessions of EA or sham treatment for 2 weeks. The participants will be blinded with non-penetrating needles and fake sounds of EA stimulators. The daily PVR ratio will be primarily measured at baseline and at the end of the study to statistically test the effectiveness of EA for poststroke urinary retention. Then, the Korean version of the Qualiveen Questionnaire, the Korean version of the International Prostate Symptom Score, and the blinding index will be assessed. After each EA session or sham EA, adverse events will be reported to evaluate the safety of EA. Results will be analyzed by using the independent t-test or Mann-Whitney U test, based on both intention-to-treat and per-protocol principles. DISCUSSION: The findings will provide clinical evidence for the effectiveness of EA treatment to improve urinary retention in stroke survivors.

#5076,Electroacupuncture ameliorates hepatic defects in a rat model of polycystic ovary syndrome induced by letrozole and a high-fat diet,"BACKGROUND: This study was designed to evaluate the effects of low-frequency electroacupuncture (EA) on glucose and lipid disturbances in a rat model of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) characterized by insulin resistance (IR) and hepatic steatosis. METHODS: The PCOS rat model was induced by continuous administration of letrozole (LET) combined with a high-fat diet (HFD). Female Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into the following four groups: control, control + EA, LET + HFD and LET + HFD + EA. EA was administered five or six times a week with a maximum of 20 treatment sessions. Body weight, estrous cyclicity, hormonal status, glucose and insulin tolerance, lipid profiles, liver inflammation factors, liver morphology and changes in the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K)/Akt (protein kinase B) pathway were evaluated. RESULTS: The rat model presented anovulatory cycles, increased body weight, elevated testosterone, abnormal glucose and lipid metabolism, IR, liver inflammation, hepatic steatosis and dysregulation of the insulin-mediated PI3-K/Akt signaling axis. EA reduced fasting blood glucose, fasting insulin, area under the curve for glucose, homeostasis model assessment of IR indices, triglycerides and free fatty acids, and alleviated hepatic steatosis. Furthermore, low-frequency EA downregulated mRNA expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-6, upregulated mRNA expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-α, increased protein expression of phosphorylated (p)-Akt (Ser473), p-glycogen synthase kinase (GSK) 3β (Ser9) and glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4), increased the ratio of p-GSK3β to GSK3β and downregulated protein expression of GSK3β. CONCLUSION: An obese PCOS rat model with IR and hepatic steatosis was successfully established by the combination of LET and HFD. EA improved dysfunctional glucose and lipid metabolism in this PCOS-IR rat model, and the molecular mechanism appeared to involve regulation of the expression of key molecules of the PI3-K/Akt insulin signaling pathway in the liver.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#5080,Effect of Somatosensory Interaction Transcutaneous Electrical Acupoint Stimulation on Cancer-related Fatigue and Immunity: A Randomized Controlled Trial,"BACKGROUND: This study was intended to evaluate the clinical effect of somatosensory interaction transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation (SI-TEAS) on cancer-related fatigue (CRF) and its safety. METHODS: The study protocol had been registered in China Clinical Trial Registration Center with registration number: ChiCTR2100045655. CRF patients were equally divided into SI-TEAS Group, Acupressure Group and Sham Acupressure Group to receive SI-TEAS, acupressure and sham acupressure treatments 5 times a week. The fatigue levels of patients in the 3 groups were measured by the Piper Fatigue Scale during the baseline period and after 4 and 8 weeks (of treatment). The cell immunity of these patients was determined by detecting the T-lymphocyte subsets and NK cells. RESULT: Of the 300 participants, 279 have gone through the independent rehabilitation intervention study, including 94 in the SI-TEAS Group, 92 in the Acupressure Group, and 93 in the Sham Acupressure Group. Intergroup comparisons of fatigue degree and cell immunity, namely SI-TEAS Group versus Acupressure Group, Acupressure Group versus Sham Acupressure Group, and SI-TEAS Group versus Sham Acupressure Group, showed that group changes observed during the baseline period and different time points after Week 4 and 8 were statistically different (P<0.05). The SI-TEAS Group had the sharpest decreases in the behavioral, sensory, emotional and cognitive dimensions of fatigue, and the total score, followed by the Acupressure Group, while the Sham Acupressure Group did not show significant changes; the SI-TEAS Group experienced the sharpest increases in the absolute counts of CD3+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, CD4+/CD8+ T cells, and NK cells, followed by the Acupressure Group, while the Sham Acupressure Group did not show significant changes. CONCLUSION: SI-TEAS could significantly relieve the fatigue of CRF patients and improve their cell immunity, which maybe a useful and effective option for reducing CRF in clinical practice.",No,No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No
#5082,Effects of acupuncture on smoking cessation or reduction for motivated smokers,"BACKGROUND: This study was undertaken to examine the effects of acupuncture on smoking reduction and possibly also cessation and to examine whether some acupoints are more effective than others for smoking cessation. METHODS: A total of 46 healthy men and women, 39 +/- 9 years of age (mean +/- SD), who smoked 20 +/- 6 cigarettes per day and had smoked for 23 +/- 8 years, and who wanted to quit smoking, volunteered to participate. The subjects were randomly assigned to two groups. One group was given acupuncture treatment at points previously used for anti-smoking (test group, TG). The other group was given acupuncture treatment at points assumed to have no effect for smoking cessation (control group, CG). Before each treatment and after the last treatment each subject answered questionnaires about his or her smoking habits and attitudes. In addition the concentrations of serum cotinine, serum thiocyanate, serum peroxides, and plasma fibrinogen were measured before the first and after the last acupuncture treatment. RESULTS: The daily cigarette consumption fell during the treatment period in both groups, but the reduction was larger for TG than for CG (P < 0.002). Altogether 31% of subjects in TG had quit smoking completely at the end of the treatment, compared with none in CG. For TG the concentrations of cotinine and thiocyanate were reduced significantly after the treatment period (P < 0.001), but no significant reductions were observed for CG. For both groups the taste of tobacco worsened during the treatment period, but the effect was more pronounced for TG than for CG (P < 0.05). The desire to smoke fell significantly in both groups after treatment, and the reduction was larger for TG than for CG (P < 0.001). No significant changes in serum peroxides and plasma fibrinogen concentrations were observed during the treatment period for either group. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that acupuncture may help motivated smokers to reduce their smoking or even quit smoking completely. Different acupoints appear to have different effects for smoking cessation and reduction.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes
#5089,Acupuncture in improving endometrial receptivity: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"BACKGROUND: This systematic review aimed at summarizing and evaluating the evidence of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) using acupuncture to improve endometrial receptivity (ER). METHODS: We searched 12 databases electronically through August 2018 without language restrictions. We included RCTs of women of infertility due to low ER, and excluded infertility caused by other reasons or non-RCTs. Two independent reviewers extracted the characteristics of studies and resolved the differences through consensus. Data were pooled and expressed as standard mean difference (SMD) or mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes and risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes, with 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: We found very low to moderate level of evidence that acupuncture may improve pregnancy rate (RR = 1.23 95%CI[1.13, 1.34] P < 0.00001) and embryo transfer rate (RR = 2.04 95%CI[1.13, 3.70] P = 0.02), increase trilinear endometrium (RR = 1.47 95%CI [1.27, 1.70] P < 0.00001), thicken endometrium (SMD = 0.41 95% CI [0.11, 0.72] P = 0.008), reduce resistive index (RI) (MD = -0.08 95% CI [- 0.15, - 0.02] P = 0.01), pulse index (PI) (SMD = -2.39 95% CI [- 3.85, - 0.93] P = 0.001) and peak systolic velocity/ end-diastolic blood velocity (S/D) (SMD = -0.60 95% CI [- 0.89, - 0.30] P < 0.0001), compared with medication, sham acupuncture or physiotherapy. Acupuncture was statistically significant as a treatment approach.

#5121,Does acupuncture have a role in the treatment of threatened miscarriage? Findings from a feasibility randomised trial and semi-structured participant interviews,"BACKGROUND: Threatened miscarriage is a common complication of early pregnancy increasing the risk of miscarriage or premature labour. Currently there is limited evidence to recommend any biomedical pharmacological or self-care management, resulting in a 'watchful waiting' approach. The objective of this study was to examine the feasibility of offering acupuncture as a therapeutic treatment for women presenting with threatened miscarriage. METHODS: A mixed methods study involving a randomised controlled trial and semi structured interviews. A pragmatic acupuncture protocol including medical self-care advice was compared to an active control receiving touch intervention and medical self-care advice. Descriptive statistics were used to examine the demographic and baseline characteristics. Endpoints were analysed between groups using a mean t-test and chi-square tests with P < 0.05 considered statistically significant. Dichotomous data was expressed as Risk Ratio with 95 % confidence intervals. Eleven participants were purposively interviewed about their experiences on exiting the trial with interviews analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Forty women were successfully randomised. For women receiving acupuncture there was a statically significant reduction with threatened miscarriage symptoms including bleeding, cramping and back pain compared with the control (p = 0.04). Thematic analysis revealed women were dissatisfied with the medical support and advice received. An overarching theme emerged from the data of 'finding something you can do.' This encompassed the themes: 'they said there was nothing they could do,' 'feeling the benefits' and 'managing while marking time.' CONCLUSION: Acupuncture was a feasible intervention and reduced threatened miscarriage symptoms when compared to a touch intervention. Further research is required to further explore acupuncture use for this common complication and whether it can reduce the incidence of miscarriage.

#5151,Comparison of magnitude and summated vector mean of surgically induced astigmatism vector according to incision site after phakic intraocular lens implantation,"BACKGROUND: To compare the arithmetic mean (M-SIA) and the summated vector mean of surgically induced astigmatism (SVM-SIA) according to the incision site after phakic intraocular lens (Visian implantable collamer lens (ICL), STAAR Surgical) implantation. METHODS: This study comprised 121 eyes of 121 consecutive patients undergoing ICL surgery through a 3.0-mm temporal or superior clear corneal incision. The magnitude and the axis of corneal astigmatism preoperatively and 3 months postoperatively were measured using an automated keratometer. The M-SIA and the SVM-SIA were determined according to the incision site. RESULTS: The magnitude of corneal astigmatism significantly increased from 1.23 ± 0.59 D preoperatively to 1.46 ± 0.72 D postoperatively in the temporal incision group (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, P < 0.001), but it significantly decreased from 1.09 ± 0.36 D preoperatively to 0.86 ± 0.41 D postoperatively in the superior incision group (P < 0.001). The M-SIA was 0.48 ± 0.30 D, and the SVM-SIA was 0.23 ± 0.52 D at a meridian of 82° in the temporal incision group. The M-SIA was 0.57 ± 0.30 D, and the SVM-SIA was 0.47 ± 0.45 D at a meridian of 1° in the superior incision group. CONCLUSIONS: ICL implantation induces the M-SIA by approximately 0.5 D, but the SVM-SIA decreased to 50% and 80% of the M-SIA in magnitude through temporal and superior incisions, respectively. The direction of the SVM-SIA showed a tendency toward corneal flattening to the incisional site. It should be noted that the M-SIA is somewhat different from the SVM-SIA according to the incision site.

#5168,Health economic evaluation of acupuncture along meridians for treating migraine in China: results from a randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: To evaluate different types of acupuncture treatment for migraine in China from the perspective of health economics, particularly the comparison between treatment of specific acupoints in Shaoyang meridians and penetrating sham acupoints treatment. METHODS: Data were obtained from a multicenter, randomized controlled trial of acupuncture treatment in patients with migraine. Four-hundred eighty migraineurs were randomly assigned to 3 arms of treatment with genuine acupoints and 1 arm of penetrating sham acupoints. The primary outcome measurement was the cost-effectiveness ratio (C/E), expressed as cost per 1 day reduction of headache days from baseline to week 16. Cost-comparison analyses, differences in the migraine-specific quality of life questionnaire (MSQ), and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio were taken as secondary outcome measurements. In addition, a sensitivity analysis was conducted. RESULTS: The total cost per patient was ¥1273.2 (95% CI 1171.3-1375.1) in the Shaoyang specific group, ¥1427.7 (95% CI 1311.8-1543.6) in the Shaoyang non-specific group, ¥1490.8 (95% CI 1327.1-1654.6) in the Yangming specific group, and ¥1470.1 (95% CI 1358.8-1581.3) in the sham acupuncture group. The reduced days with migraine were 3.972 ± 2.7, 3.555 ± 2.8, 3.793 ± 3.6, and 2.155 ± 3.7 in these 4 groups (P < 0.05 for each genuine acupoints group vs the sham group), respectively, at week 16. The C/Es of the 4 groups were 320.5, 401.6, 393.1, and 682.2, respectively. Results of the sensitivity analysis were consistent with that of the cost-effectiveness analysis. The Shaoyang specific group significantly improved in all 3 MSQ domains compared with the sham acupuncture group. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of specific acupoints in Shaoyang meridians is more cost-effective than that of non-acupoints, representing a dramatic improvement in the quality of life of people with migraine and a significant reduction in cost. Compared with the other 3 groups, Shaoyang-specific acupuncture is a relatively cost-effective treatment for migraine prophylaxis in China.

#5215,"German Acupuncture Trials (GERAC) for chronic low back pain: randomized, multicenter, blinded, parallel-group trial with 3 groups","BACKGROUND: To our knowledge, verum acupuncture has never been directly compared with sham acupuncture and guideline-based conventional therapy in patients with chronic low back pain. METHODS: A patient- and observer-blinded randomized controlled trial conducted in Germany involving 340 outpatient practices, including 1162 patients aged 18 to 86 years (mean +/- SD age, 50 +/- 15 years) with a history of chronic low back pain for a mean of 8 years. Patients underwent ten 30-minute sessions, generally 2 sessions per week, of verum acupuncture (n = 387) according to principles of traditional Chinese medicine; sham acupuncture (n = 387) consisting of superficial needling at nonacupuncture points; or conventional therapy, a combination of drugs, physical therapy, and exercise (n = 388). Five additional sessions were offered to patients who had a partial response to treatment (10%-50% reduction in pain intensity). Primary outcome was response after 6 months, defined as 33% improvement or better on 3 pain-related items on the Von Korff Chronic Pain Grade Scale questionnaire or 12% improvement or better on the back-specific Hanover Functional Ability Questionnaire. Patients who were unblinded or had recourse to other than permitted concomitant therapies during follow-up were classified as nonresponders regardless of symptom improvement. RESULTS: At 6 months, response rate was 47.6% in the verum acupuncture group, 44.2% in the sham acupuncture group, and 27.4% in the conventional therapy group. Differences among groups were as follows: verum vs sham, 3.4% (95% confidence interval, -3.7% to 10.3%; P = .39); verum vs conventional therapy, 20.2% (95% confidence interval, 13.4% to 26.7%; P < .001); and sham vs conventional therapy, 16.8% (95% confidence interval, 10.1% to 23.4%; P < .001.

#5242,Efficacy of different-frequency TEAS on acute pain after the total knee arthroplasty: a study protocol for a parallel group randomized trial,"BACKGROUND: Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is an optimal option for patients with middle-to-end-stage knee osteoarthritis. However, the management of postoperative acute pain remains inefficient. Transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation (TEAS) is a nonpharmacological method to manage postoperative acute pain. Different frequencies of TEAS have been tested using varying parameters, but the optimal analgesic frequency remains controversial. The aim of this study was to explore the optimal analgesic frequency of TEAS for treating acute pain after the primary unilateral TKA. METHODS/DESIGN: This is a double-blind, randomized controlled trial. A total of 156 patients are randomly assigned to: G1, 5 Hz TEAS; G2, 100 Hz TEAS; G3, mixed TEAS (alternative use of daily 5 Hz and 100 Hz TEAS) and G4, placebo TEAS. In the G1, G2 and G3 groups, TEAS is conducted at acupoints SP9 and GB34 of the leg that was operated on (at a wave of continuous, balanced and asymmetrical biphasic square, with a pulse width of 200 μs, and a strong but comfortable current) for 30 min prior to a 30-min rehabilitation session per day for 2 weeks. In G4 group, TEAS is delivered at a strong but comfortable current for 30 s, then the current is gradually decreased to none over the next 15 s. The primary outcomes are measured before surgery, at baseline (POD 3, before TEAS intervention), week 1 and 2 after TEAS intervention with the Numeric Pain Rating Scale and The American Knee Society Score. The secondary outcomes include: (1) Active range of motion of the knee that was operated on; (2) Surface electromyography of both quadriceps; (3) Modified 30-s sit to stand test; (4) Additional usage of analgesia; and (5) SF-36. The additional outcomes include: (1) Patients' satisfaction rate; (2) Patient's expectation rate; and (3) Incidence of analgesia-related side effects. To test the blinding of participants and assessors, they are asked to guess whether the subjects received active or placebo TEAS within 5 min after the latest intervention. The safety and financial cost of TEAS are assessed. DISCUSSION: Mixed TEAS has more favorable effect on acute pain control than the placebo or 5 Hz or 100 Hz TEAS.

METHOD: A non-randomized controlled trial was designed with monitoring of the meridian electro-conductivity and heart-rate variability (HRV) to compare the efficacy of Kuan-Sin-Yin in the control and experimental groups. 52 patients were enrolled in this study. We also measured cancer-related symptoms and quality of life as secondary outcomes. RESULTS: We found that colon cancer patients who received KSY as complementary therapy benefitted with enhancement of meridian energy (Yin meridian: 27.90:35.45μA; p=0.014; Yang meridian: 27.09:33.55μA; p=0.024) and increases in HRV activity (78.40:129.04ms; SDNN: p=0.001) and parasympathetic tone(HF:1644.80:3217.92 ms(2); p=0.003; RMMSD:99.76:164.52ms; p=0.002). Cancer-related symptoms decreased (ECOG>1:46.2:7.7%; p=0.0001), and quality of life (KSY group: PCS 35.46:42.12, p=0.0001; MCS: 44.50:47.55, p=0.209) was improved with statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: The correlation of positive results reflected in meridian energy and HRV activity confirms the positive role of complementary medicine of Kuan-Sin-Yin in cancer care.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#5263,Acupuncture is effective in the treatment of postprandial distress syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"BACKGROUND: Traditional Chinese medicine advocates the use of acupuncture for the treatment of postprandial distress syndrome (PDS) in people with Functional dyspepsia, but large clinical trials of acupuncture have produced controversial results. This study aims to confirm the clinical significance of acupuncture in the treatment of PDS . METHODS: This study only randomized controlled trials were included from the following databases: CNKI, Medline, Cochrane Central, Web of Science, and Clinical Trial. The risk of bias in the included studies was assessed using Revman 5.4.1 (Revman 2020), and all 12 included studies were considered to have a low risk of bias. This study used Stata 16.1 for data analysis, including sensitivity analysis and publication bias test. The quality of each study was evaluated with the Cochrane tool. The main outcomes included the overall therapeutic rate, the SID score, the HADS Score, The NDI score, and Side effects. RESULTS: This study identified a total of 1532 studies interested in the curative effect of acupuncture on Postprandial discomfort syndrome (PDS) and finally included a total of 12 studies with 1113 patients after identifying their abstracts, titles, and full text. The process of literature searches and identifying is shown in Figure 1 and data analysis showed that acupuncture is effective in the treatment of PDS and promotes the life quality of patients. CONCLUSIONS: This study analyzed the effects of acupuncture on PDS from 5 aspects: overall therapeutic rate, SID, HADS, NDI, and side effects, overall therapeutic rate as primary outcome measure. Statistical analysis results showed that acupuncture has a significant effect on the treatment of PDS. In conclusion, it is an effective clinical treatment method.

#5269,An experimental study on the self-report of acupuncture needle sensation during deep needling with bi-directional rotation,"BACKGROUND: Traditionally, acupuncturists manipulate needles to enhance sensations referred to as de qi or 'acupuncture needle sensation'. Acupuncture needle sensations are complex and quantifying the experience has been difficult. The aim of this crossover study was to measure self-reported needle sensation during deep and bi-directional rotated needling in 15 healthy volunteers. METHODS: Each participant received an experimental intervention consisting of superficial needling followed by deep needling and then deep needling with bi-directional rotation. The control intervention consisted of superficial needling, followed by mock deep needling and then mock bi-directional rotation of the needle. The intensity of overall needle sensation was measured using a visual analogue scale (VAS). The subjective acupuncture sensation scale was used to capture component sensations. RESULTS: VAS scores were higher during 'deep' needle penetration when compared to superficial needling with mock deep insertion (p=0.0002). VAS scores were also higher during deep needling with bi-directional rotation compared to superficial needling with mock bi-directional rotation (p<0.0001). There were higher scores for total component sensation scores and for the sensation of throbbing during the deep needling with bi-directional rotation (p=0.001) when compared to superficial needling with mock bi-directional rotation. Tentative evidence that bi-directional needle rotation generated stabbing, tingling, heaviness, soreness and aching was also found. CONCLUSION: Bi-directional rotation of a needle inserted into deep soft tissue produced higher acupuncture needle sensation intensities when compared to superficial needle insertion with mock deep penetration and bi-directional rotation.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#5332,Acupuncture versus subcutaneous injections of sterile water as treatment for labour pain,"BACKGROUND: Two methods for pain relief and relaxation during labour are sterile water injections and acupuncture. In several studies, sterile water injections have been shown to provide good pain relief, particularly for low back pain during labour. The acupuncture studies for pain relief during labour are not as concordant. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore if there were any differences between acupuncture and sterile water injections regarding pain relief and relaxation during labour. METHODS: A randomised controlled trial. Some 128 pregnant women at term were randomly assigned to receive acupuncture (n=62) or sterile water injections (n=66). The primary endpoint was to compare the differences between pre-treatment pain levels and maximum pain in the 2 groups. RESULTS: The main results of this study were that sterile water injections yielded greater pain relief (p<0.001) during childbirth compared to acupuncture. The secondary outcome showed that women in the sterile water group had a higher degree of relaxation (p<0.001) compared to the acupuncture group. The women's own assessment of the effects also favoured sterile water injections (p<0.001). There were no significant differences regarding requirements for additional pain relief after treatment between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: Women given sterile water injection experience less labour pain compared to women given acupuncture.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes
#5338,Acupuncture and related techniques for type 2 diabetes mellitus: A systematic review protocol,"BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a major global health problem. As a complementary treatment, acupuncture and related techniques are widely used to treat metabolic and endocrine diseases, but their efficacy and safety for T2DM are yet to be established. This systematic review will qualitatively and quantitatively summarize the current randomized controlled trial (RCT) evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of acupuncture and related techniques in patients with T2DM. METHODS: Comprehensive literature searches will be performed on PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and a trial registry ""ClinicalTrials.gov"" from inception to December 3, 2018. We will include RCTs for patients with T2DM that compared acupuncture with placebo, antidiabetic drugs, lifestyle interventions, or the combination. Primary outcomes are fasting blood glucose and hemoglobin A1c. Secondary outcomes include 2-hour blood glucose, fasting insulin, homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance, incidence of diabetic complications, and acupuncture-related adverse events. The risk of bias of the RCTs included in the review will be examined using a revised Cochrane handbook tool. Heterogeneity will be detected using Cochran Q test and I statistics. With the use of random effects model, we will perform meta-analyses to pool results of RCTs. The effect measures will be weighted or standardized mean difference with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the continuous outcomes and risk ratio with 95% CIs for the dichotomous outcomes. Subgroup analyses and meta-regression with predefined effect modifiers will be performed to explore the sources of heterogeneity. Where appropriate, we will assess the possibility of reporting bias based on funnel plots and quantitative detection. We will appraise the quality of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system for each outcome. RESULTS: This study will provide accurate results and balanced inferences on the efficacy and safety of acupuncture and related techniques on T2DM. CONCLUSION: This well-designed systematic review will establish high-quality evidence of the efficacy and safety of acupuncture and related techniques for T2DM to facilitate the clinical practice and guideline development.

#5380,The Effect of Magnetic Therapy on Postoperative Urinary Retention in Patients Undergoing Surgery: A Randomized Clinical Trial,"BACKGROUND: Urinary retention is a postoperative problem that causes pain and discomfort for patients, even when catheters are used. The potential role of magnetic therapy in treating postoperative urinary retention through acupuncture points remains uncertain. This research aims to assess the impact of magnetic therapy on urinary retention in patients undergoing surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This single-blind clinical trial study was conducted in a recovery department within an operating room and subsequently in the Surgery Department of Amin Hospital. The study took place in Isfahan in 2022, with a sample of 64 patients selected using a simple random sampling method and divided equally into two groups. In the intervention group, magnet plates were applied, while the control group received iron plates at seven specific points for duration of 35 ± 5 minutes. Demographic information, the type of urinary excretion, the duration of urinary retention, and the volume of excreted urine were recorded using a researcher-made checklist for both intervention and control groups. These data were compared and subjected to descriptive and analytical statistical analysis. RESULTS: Among the participants (N = 64), the majority were male (N = 37, 57.80%), and the mean age was 40.17 years. The Chi-square analysis revealed no significant difference between the intervention and control groups in terms of the type of urinary excretion (p = 0.106). However, the Mann-Whitney U-test demonstrated significant difference between the two groups regarding the duration required to eliminate urinary retention and the volume of excreted urine (F(2,41) = 62 and F(1,76) = 62; p < 0.001).

#5385,"Acupuncture for chronic low back pain: protocol for a multicenter, randomized, sham-controlled trial","BACKGROUND: Use of acupuncture has widely increased in patients with chronic low back pain. However, the evidence supporting its efficacy remains unclear. In this article, we report the design and the protocol of a multi-center randomized sham-controlled trial to treat chronic low back pain. Our goal is to verify the effect of acupuncture on chronic low back pain. METHODS/DESIGN: This study is a multi-center randomized sham-controlled trial with 2 parallel arms. Participants included in the study met the following criteria: 1) low back pain lasting for at least the last 3 months, 2) a documented >or= 5 points on a 10 cm visual analog scale for bothersomeness of low back pain at the time of screening and 3) between 18 and 65 years of age. Participants were blinded to the real and sham acupuncture treatments. The real acupuncture treatment group received real acupuncture 2 times a week, during a total of 12 sessions over 6 weeks. The control group received sham acupuncture during the same period. In order to assess the primary and secondary outcome measures, the participants were asked to fill out a questionnaire at the baseline and 6, 8, 12 and 24 weeks after starting the treatments. The primary outcome was measured using the visual analog scale for bothersomeness of low back pain at 8 weeks after the initiation of treatments. DISCUSSION: The result of this trial (which will be available in 2010) will demonstrate the efficacy of using acupuncture to treat chronic low back pain.

#5392,"A systematic review and network meta-analysis of psychological, psychosocial, pharmacological, physical and combined treatments for adults with a new episode of depression","BACKGROUND: Various effective treatments for depression exist. We aimed to identify the most effective first-line treatments for new episodes of less and more severe depression (defined by depression scale cut-off scores), to update NICE guidance on the management of Depression in Adults in England. METHODS: Systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published up to June 2020 (PROSPERO registration number CRD42019151328). We analysed interventions by class and individually. The primary efficacy outcome was depressive symptom change (expressed as standardised mean difference [SMD]). The review for this outcome was updated in November 2023. FINDINGS: We included 676 RCTs, 105,477 participants and 63 treatment classes. For less severe depression, group cognitive/cognitive behavioural therapy (CT/CBT) class was efficacious versus treatment as usual [TAU], the reference treatment for this population [SMD -1.01 (95% Credible Interval [CrI] -1.76; -0.06)]. For more severe depression, efficacious classes versus pill placebo (reference treatment for this population) included combined individual CT/CBT with antidepressants [-1.18 (-2.07; -0.44)], individual behavioural therapies [-0.86 (-1.65; -0.16)], combined light therapy with antidepressants [-0.86 (-1.59; -0.12)], combined acupuncture with antidepressants [-0.78 (-1.12; -0.44)], individual CT/CBT [-0.78 (-1.42; -0.33)], mirtazapine [-0.35 (-0.48; -0.22)], serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors [-0.32 (-0.43; -0.22)], tricyclic antidepressants [-0.29 (-0.50; -0.05)], and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [-0.24 (-0.32; -0.16)]. Additional treatments showed evidence of efficacy at the intervention level. Evidence for less and more severe depression was of low and low-to-moderate quality, respectively. In the 2023 update, group yoga and self-help without support emerged as efficacious for less severe depression. For more severe depression, combined group exercise with antidepressants emerged as efficacious, whereas combined light therapy with antidepressants failed to remain efficacious. INTERPRETATION: Group CT/CBT (and possibly group yoga and self-help) appears efficacious in less severe depression, whereas antidepressants do not show evidence of effect. Combined antidepressants with individual CT/CBT, acupuncture and, possibly, group exercise, individual psychological therapies (behavioural therapies, CT/CBT) alone, and antidepressants alone appear efficacious in more severe depression. Quality of evidence, cost-effectiveness, applicability and implementation issues also need to be considered when formulating clinical practice recommendations.

#5448,Pulsatile dry cupping in chronic low back pain - a randomized three-armed controlled clinical trial,"BACKGROUND: We aimed to investigate the effectiveness of two different forms of dry pulsatile cupping in patients with chronic low back pain (cLBP) compared to medication on demand only in a three-armed randomized trial. METHODS: 110 cLBP patients were randomized to regular pulsatile cupping with 8 treatments plus paracetamol on demand (n = 37), minimal cupping with 8 treatments plus paracetamol on demand (n = 36) or the control group with paracetamol on demand only (n = 37). Primary outcome was the pain intensity on a visual analogue scale (VAS, 0-100 mm) after 4 weeks, secondary outcome parameter included VAS pain intensity after 12 weeks, back function as measured with the 'Funktionsfragebogen Hannover Rücken' (FFbH-R) and health related quality of life questionnaire Short form 36 (SF-36) after 4 and 12 weeks. RESULTS: The mean baseline-adjusted VAS after 4 weeks was 34.9 mm (95% CI: 28.7; 41.2) for pulsatile cupping, 40.4 (34.2; 46.7) for minimal cupping and 56.1 (49.8; 62.4) for control group, resulting in statistically significant differences between pulsatile cupping vs. control (21.2 (12.2; 30.1); p < 0.001) and minimal cupping vs. control (15.7 (6.9; 24.4); p = 0.001). After 12 weeks, mean adjusted VAS difference between pulsatile cupping vs. control was 15.1 ((3.1; 27.1); p = 0.014), and between minimal cupping vs. control 11.5 ((- 0.44; 23.4); p = 0.059). Differences of VAS between pulsatile cupping and minimal cupping showed no significant differences after 4 or 12 weeks. Pulsatile cupping was also better (- 5.8 (- 11.5;-0.1); p = 0.045) compared to control for back function after 4 weeks, but not after 12 weeks (- 5.4 (- 11.7;0.8); p = 0.088), pulsatile cupping also showed better improvements on SF-36 physical component scale compared to control at 4 and 12 weeks (- 5.6 (- 9.3;-2.0); p = 0.003; - 6.1 (- 9.9;-2.4); p = 0.002). For back function and quality of life minimal cupping group was not statistically different to control after 4 and 12 weeks. Paracetamol intake did not differ between the groups (cupping vs. control (7.3 (- 0.4;15.0); p = 0.063); minimal cupping vs. control (6.3 (- 2.0;14.5); p = 0.133). CONCLUSIONS: Both forms of cupping were effective in cLBP without showing significant differences in direct comparison after four weeks, only pulsatile cupping showed effects compared to control after 12 weeks.

#5477,Use acupuncture to treat functional constipation: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Whether acupuncture is effective for patients with functional constipation is still unclear. Therefore, we report the protocol of a randomized controlled trial of using acupuncture to treat functional constipation. DESIGN: A randomized, controlled, four-arm design, large-scale trial is currently undergoing in China. Seven hundred participants are randomly assigned to three acupuncture treatment groups and Mosapride Citrate control group in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Participants in acupuncture groups receive 16 sessions of acupuncture treatment, and are followed up for a period of 9 weeks after randomization. The acupuncture groups are: (1) Back-Shu and Front-Mu acupoints of Large Intestine meridians (Shu-Mu points group); (2) He-Sea and Lower He-Sea acupoints of Large Intestine meridians (He points group); (3) Combining used Back-Shu, Front-Mu, He-Sea, and Lower He-Sea acupoints of Large Intestine meridians (Shu-Mu-He points group). The control group is Mosapride Citrate group. The primary outcome is frequency of defecation per week at the fourth week after randomization. The secondary outcomes include Bristol stool scale, the extent of difficulty during defecating, MOS 36-item Short Form health survey (SF-36), Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), and Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS). The first two of second outcomes are measured 1 week before randomization and 2, 4, and 8 weeks after randomization. Other second outcomes are measured 1 week before randomization and 2 and 4 weeks after randomization, but SF-36 is measured at randomization and 4 weeks after randomization. DISCUSSION: The result of this trial (which will be available in 2012) will confirm whether acupuncture is effective to treat functional constipation and whether traditional acupuncture theories play an important role in it.

#5503,Factors affecting decision-making of patients choosing acupuncture in a public hospital,"BACKGROUND: With increasing evidence to support its practice, acupuncture has been integrated within many hospitals around the world. The purpose of this study is to understand the factors affecting decision making of patients as they select acupuncture treatment for their medical conditions and symptoms within a public hospital. METHODS: A qualitative study consisting of in depth interviews with 14 patients was conducted. All patients attended an acupuncture clinic within a public hospital. Data collected was analysed via thematic analysis. RESULTS: Four main factor groups affecting decision making of patients were identified- factors affecting the level and value of patient-centric care, the confidence and trust patients place within the acupuncture service, the presence of collaborative efforts between acupuncturists and Western medicine practitioners, and the knowledge, culture and belief society has regarding the role of acupuncture and Western medicine. All participants interviewed had more than one factor group present as enablers toward their eventual selection of acupuncture for ailment management. It was also noted that although the majority of participants had sufficient knowledge regarding acupuncture, there were a select few who had misperceptions or no knowledge regarding certain aspects of acupuncture. CONCLUSIONS: There may be certain patterns in the way patients choose to utilise acupuncture services in public hospitals.

#5504,Complementary and alternative medicine and supportive care at leading cancer centers: a systematic analysis of websites,"BACKGROUND: With increasing frequency, patients with cancer and their family members are turning to the Internet to educate themselves about their disease and treatment options, including complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) and supportive care. However, very little is known about how national leading cancer centers represent these therapies via their websites. METHODS: Simulating the perspective of an information-seeking patient or family member, we performed a systematic analysis of the websites of 41 National Cancer Institute designated comprehensive cancer centers. Two researchers independently evaluated websites, recorded CAM information, and rated quality of the websites using a 4-item Likert scale (overall, information, presentation, and navigation) with Cronbach's alpha = 0.97. Rating was adequately correlated between the two raters (correlation coefficient 0.8). RESULTS: Of 41 centers, 12 (29%) did not have functional websites with regard to information related to CAM. The most common CAM approaches mentioned were: acupuncture (59%), meditation/nutrition/spiritual support/yoga (56% for each), massage therapy (54%), and music therapy (51%). Twenty-three (23; 56%) presented information on support groups, 19 (46%) on patient seminars, 18 (44%) on survivorship effort, and 17 (41%) on symptom management clinics. Twenty-nine (29) (71%) of these websites had a telephone number available, 22 (54%) mentioned at least one ongoing research opportunity, and 19 (46%) provided links to the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine website. Median rating of the quality of websites was 50 of 100, with only 7 (17%) of centers receiving a composite score 80 (excellent) or better. CONCLUSIONS: While a growing number of leading cancer centers provide information about CAM and supportive oncology information for patients via their websites, the quality and ease of navigation of these sites remain highly variable. Effective development and redesign of many of the websites is needed to better inform and empower patients and families seeking CAM and supportive care information.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#5523,Acupuncture for pain control after degenerative lumbar spine surgery,"BACKGROUND: Wound pain after surgery for lumbar spine disease may interfere with patients' recovery. Acupuncture is commonly used for pain management, but its efficacy for postoperative pain control is unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of acupuncture for adjuvant pain control after surgery for degenerative lumbar spine disease. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of consecutive patients who received surgery for degenerative lumbar spine disease at our institution from 2013 to 2014. Surgical procedures included open laminectomy, discectomy, and trans-pedicle screw instrumentation with posterior-lateral fusion. Patients were grouped by pain control methods, including routine analgesia, patient-controlled analgesia (PCA), and acupuncture. The routine analgesia group received oral acetaminophen/non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs with meperidine as needed for immediate pain control. The PCA group received a basal dose of morphine and subsequent user-demand doses. The acupuncture group received acupuncture every other day after surgery. RESULTS: Ninety-six patients were included, of whom 37 received acupuncture, 27 received PCA, and 32 received routine analgesics for pain control. Visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores in all 3 groups decreased significantly, and to the same degree, from the first postoperative day to the second day. No significant differences were found in VAS scores over the next 6 postoperative days; however, the scores of patients treated with PCA were slightly but still significantly higher (p = 0.026) on postoperative day 4 than scores of patients treated with acupuncture and traditional analgesia, a difference likely due to PCA being discontinued on postoperative day 3. No major complications were noted in the acupuncture group, but 2 patients dropped out because of fear of needle insertion. CONCLUSIONS: Acupuncture may be as effective as traditional analgesia and PCA for adjuvant pain control after surgery for degenerative lumbar spine disease.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#5532,Efficacy and safety of the "Xingnao Kaiqiao" acupuncture technique via intradermal needling to treat postoperative gastrointestinal dysfunction of laparoscopic surgery: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Xingnao Kaiqiao acupuncture involves needling of the Neiguan (PC6), Renzhong (DU26), and Sanyinjiao (SP6) acupoints. The technique has a significant clinical effect in many neurological diseases. In the present report, we have developed a protocol for a scientific trial to analyze whether Xingnao Kaiqiao can be used to treat gastrointestinal dysfunction after laparoscopic surgery. In this context, we intend to execute a double-blind, randomized controlled trial to assess the efficacy and safety of Xingnao Kaiqiao acupuncture via intradermal needling. METHODS/DESIGN: This will be a single-center, double-blind, randomized controlled clinical trial. It has been designed on the basis of the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT 2010) guidelines and the Standards for Reporting Interventions in Controlled Trials of Acupuncture (STRICTA). The subjects will be recruited from among inpatients scheduled for laparoscopic surgery at the Department of Minimally Invasive Surgery, Tianjin Nankai Hospital, Tianjin, China. Using random numbers generated in SPSS 19.0, the recruited subjects will be allocated to either the ""Xingnao Kaiqiao"" group or the sham stimulation group. A specially appointed investigator will be in charge of the randomization. Xingnao Kaiqiao via intradermal needling (or sham needling) will be administered 6 h after laparoscopic surgery, and then every 12 h for a total of six sessions, each of which will last 3 min. The subjects will undergo their first evaluation shortly before the first treatment (6 h after laparoscopic surgery); evaluations will be repeated every 12 h until a total of seven evaluations have been completed. The primary outcome will be the time until the first postoperative flatus. The secondary outcomes will be: the time until the first postoperative defecation; levels of abdominal pain, abdominal distension, and nausea; blood ghrelin level; occurrence of vomiting; psychological status; and quality of life. DISCUSSION: This upcoming randomized clinical trial was designed as a standardized method to assess the efficacy and safety of Xingnao Kaiqiao acupuncture using intradermal needles on PC6, DU26, and SP6 in the treatment of gastrointestinal dysfunction after laparoscopic surgery. We aim to provide evidence and thus improve the clinical application of this technique. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, ChiCTR-IOR-17010763 .

Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) nonpharmacological interventions are becoming increasingly popular for cancer treatment and rehabilitation interventions. However, their efficacy and safety remain unclear and there is no systematic review or meta-analysis focusing fully on this issue. We aim to evaluate the effects of representative TCM nonpharmacological interventions, including Qigong, Tai Chi, acupuncture, and Tuina, on CRF in BC patients. METHODS: Published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed the efficacy of these interventions on CRF for BC patients will be included. We will search from the following electronic databases: PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, MEDLINE, Web of Science, Scopus, PsycINFO, PSYINDEX, CINAHL, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), WanFang Database, and Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM). The primary outcomes are the improvement of CRF, which will be evaluated by the Piper Fatigue Scale (PFS), the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT)-Fatigue Scale, Schwartz Cancer Fatigue Scale (SCFS), the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI). The secondary outcomes are quality of life and safety. The meta-analysis will be performed using RevMan ver 5.3(Cochrane) statistical software. RESULTS: We will provide more practical results investigating the efficacy of Qigong, Tai Chi, acupuncture, Tuina for BC patients with CRF from several respects including the improvement of fatigue, quality of life, and safety. CONCLUSIONS: This review will generate more stronger evidence in BC patients for TCM nonpharmacological interventions, including Qigong, Tai Chi, acupuncture, Tuina, in the treatment of CRF and help to inform clinicians and policymakers.

OBJECTIVE: This research aims to provide evidence for efficacy and safety of warm needle acupuncture for allergic rhinitis. SEARCH STRATEGIES: Seven online databases were searched for study collection, which were published up to March 15th, 2022. Keywords of searching included ""AR"", ""allergic rhinitis"", ""anaphylactic rhinitis"", ""warming needle"", ""warming needle acupuncture"", ""needle warming moxibustion"", ""warm needle"", ""warm needling method"" and ""warmed needle"". The quality of the included trials was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. INTERVENTIONS: Among the included trials, warm needle acupuncture-either alone or in combination with Western medicine or other acupoint-based therapies-served as the primary intervention for the experimental groups. In contrast, the control groups received treatments such as Western medicine alone, manual acupuncture alone, or a combination of electro and manual acupuncture. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses were conducted using RevMan 5.3, following the Cochrane systematic review methodology, while trial sequential analysis was performed with TSA 0.9. The quality of the findings was assessed using GRADEpro. RESULTS: Finally, 23 studies involving 2230 participants were covered. Results of this study revealed that warm needle acupuncture only, or with western medicine, or with other acupoint-based interventions were significantly superior to western medicine alone, manual acupuncture alone, or electro plus manual acupuncture for allergic rhinitis. Adverse events associated with warm needle acupuncture included sensations of chest tightness, throat itching, and allergic reactions to moxa smoke; however, these occurrences were not more frequent than those observed with Western medicine. There is need for RCTs of high quality with placebo or waitlist controls of the intervention for allergic rhinitis.

Acupuncture was the most frequently used intervention of Ciliao (BL 32), followed by electroacupuncture. Dysmenorrhea and labor analgesia were the dominant indications of single-acupoint prescriptions of Ciliao (BL 32), and 9 diseases i.e. dysmenorrhea, urinary incontinence, urinary retention, chronic pelvic inflammatory disease, chronic prostatitis and lumbar disc herniation were the dominant indications of compound prescriptions. The main indications of Ciliao (BL 32) involved diseases of reproductive system, urinary system and waist. There were 92 acupoints in compatibility with Ciliao (BL 32), which were main belonged to the bladder meridian, the conception vessel and the spleen meridian, the most frequently used acupoints were Sanyinjiao (SP 6), Guanyuan (CV 4), Shenshu (BL 23) and Zhongji (CV 3).",Yes,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#5557,Treating pain using acupuncture for nonacupuncturists,"Battlefield acupuncture is a specific auricular acupuncture protocol that can be performed by nonacupuncturists in military and civilian clinical settings. Battlefield acupuncture is purported to be efficacious in controlling pain, is quickly administered, and requires minimal postadministration observation. With very low risk and a negligible adverse reaction profile, this technique can be used as an alternative or complement to manage pain. More large randomized controlled trials are needed to compare acupuncture with standard therapy in military and civilian settings.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#5561,How good is the match between the plane of the text and the plane of focus during reading?,"Because results from animal models demonstrate that retinal image defocus is a crucial factor in the visual control of eye growth, we have measured the precision of accommodation during reading at 1 m and at 30 cm distance. A newly developed photorefractor was used to sample both the refraction in the vertical meridian and direction of gaze at 25 Hz. Using these two parameters, a three-dimensional ""refraction map"" of the visual field was plotted. It showed the optic disc as an area with more myopic refractions and the course of refractions across a visual field of about +/- 25 deg. A special calibration scheme was employed to ensure that the precision of the refractions was 0.2 dpt or better (as estimated from the standard deviations of repeated measurements and the noise in the calibration curve). Twelve young adults (students from the lab) served as subjects. We found considerable inter-individual variability in the off-axis refractions but little variability among repeated measurements in the same subjects. Inter-individual variability reached a minimum in the foveal region. Both myopes wearing their spectacle corrections (n = 6) and emmetropes (n = 6) under-accommodated by about 0.3 D during reading at 30 cm distance but, at 1 m distance, only the emmetropes under-accommodated. Since both refraction groups under-accommodated similarly during reading at close distance, it remains unclear whether the small amount of defocus is critical for their future myopia development. Either accommodation errors differ at earlier times when myopia first appears (as suggested by the literature), or the subjects' eye growth was differently sensitive to defocus, or our simple protocol did not pick up existent differences in accommodation among the two groups.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No

#5572,A Dutch view of the ''science'' of CAM 1986--2003,"Between 1986 and 2003, research efforts on complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) were subsidized by the Dutch government. This led to 12 academic theses and a considerable number of papers in medical journals. In our review, we have summarized the results of this research, grouped by therapeutic category (that is, acupuncture, paranormal therapies, naturopathy, manual therapies, homeopathy and anthroposophical medicine.) Of the 12 theses, four were written in Dutch, three of which were not subsequently published in peer-reviewed journals, while the fourth, on enzyme therapy, led to a number of papers in Dutch medical journals. In three instances, mildly positive findings were reported: on the efficacy of manual therapies, the use of acupuncture analgesia in surgery, and an elimination diet against migraine and tension headaches. These positive conclusions can easily be explained by methodological shortcomings (e.g., not using credible placebo-control groups); in the other nine theses, the researchers themselves had drawn negative conclusions. The Dutch government ended its financial support for CAM research in 2006.",Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No

Breastfeeding is associated with better nutritional and non-nutritional outcomes when compared to formula feeding, and has proven health benefits to both infants and their mothers. This clinical research is to examine the feasibility and efficacy of Acupoint-Tuina therapy in treating postpartum women who underwent C-sections and suffered from insufficient milk production.The patients in the control group received standard medical care, while the patients in the Tuina group received Tuina therapy during the next 48 hours in addition to standard care, given once daily for 2 days. To evaluate the efficacy of Tuina therapy, patients of both groups were assessed for surface temperature of breasts, volume of breasts, volume of breast milk production, serum PRL level, and uterus recovery at various time points.Tuina therapy significantly increased the milk production when compared to the control group, for as much as 13-fold and 10-fold of that in the control group on the third and fourth postpartum days. In addition, Tuina therapy also significantly increased the full breast enlargement and the serum PRL level change, and decreased the breast surface temperature rise. Last but not the least, Tuina therapy also accelerated the post-surgery recovery of uterus.During the early postpartum days, Tuina therapy increases the milk production and promotes other physiological changes supporting lactation for postpartum women with C-section delivery and insufficient breast milk production. The novel intervention is warranted for further investigation and validation.",No,No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No
#5599,[Cancer-related fatigue],"Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is a very common and distressing symptom experienced by most cancer patients, during and after treatments and also at the end of life. There is no accepted definition of CRF, because it is a multifaceted symptom that involves multiple biopsychosocial aspects. Several scales for assessing CRF have been used, unidimensional or multidimensional, but there is no agreement regarding the best instrument to measure CRF. Concerning the CRF treatment, pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic interventions have been used. Pharmacologic therapies have been evaluated in few randomized clinical trials: corticosteroids demonstrated a superior efficacy to the placebo in terminal cancer patients; psychostimulants (methylfenidate, dexamphetamine, modafinil), antidepressant (paroxetine), acetilcholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil), l-carnitine and coenzyme Q(10) generally have reported negative results. Non-pharmacologic interventions (physical exercise, psychosocial interventions and other integrative interventions, such as yoga, ginseng, acupuncture) have been evaluated in several randomized and non-randomized studies, but with many methodological limitations. Therefore, the most effective non-pharmacological intervention remains unclear and the effect sizes are small.

This study aimed to assess the initial effectiveness and safety of 3.95 μm infrared moxibustion for CRF. A randomized controlled trial was conducted with 65 CRF-diagnosed cancer patients, where the treatment group received 3.95 μm infrared moxibustion on on the ST36 (bilateral), CV4, and CV6 acupoints, each patient underwent 30-minute sessions, with 8 sessions per course and a total of 24 sessions, while the control group received standard care. The study evaluated fatigue and sleep quality using the Piper Fatigue Score (PFS) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) after the 2nd and 3rd sessions. After the 2nd session, individual fatigue was significantly lower in the infrared moxibustion treatment group than in the control group (6.39 vs. 5.26, P = 0.000). After the 3rd session, individuals treated with infrared moxibustion had significantly better fatigue and sleep quality than the control group (6.60 vs. 4.63, P = 0.000), (9.45 vs. 7.84, P = 0.041). The safety profile of infrared moxibustion was favorable, with only four cases of skin adverse reactions reported. This study suggests that infrared moxibustion is a safe and effective treatment for CRF in Chinese cancer patients.

#5614,Management of Central Poststroke Pain: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,"Central poststroke pain (CPSP) is a neuropathic pain condition prevalent in 8 to 35% of stroke patients. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to provide insight into the effectiveness of available pharmacological, physical, psychological, and neuromodulation interventions in reducing pain in CPSP patients (PROSPERO Registration: CRD42022371835). Secondary outcomes included mood, sleep, global impression of change, and physical responses. Data extraction included participant demographics, stroke etiology, pain characteristics, pain reduction scores, and secondary outcome metrics. Forty-two original studies were included, with a total of 1,451 participants. No studies providing psychological therapy to CPSP patients were identified. Twelve studies met requirements for a random-effects meta-analyses that found pharmacological therapy to have a small effect on mean pain score (SMD = -.36, 96.0% confidence interval [-.68, -.03]), physical interventions did not show a significant effect (SMD = -.55 [-1.28, .18]), and neuromodulation treatments had a moderate effect (SMD = -.64 [-1.08, -.19]). Fourteen studies were included in proportional meta-analysis with pharmacological studies having a moderate effect (58.3% mean pain reduction [-36.51, -80.15]) and neuromodulation studies a small effect (31.1% mean pain reduction [-43.45, -18.76]). Sixteen studies were included in the narrative review, the findings from which largely supported meta-analysis results. Duloxetine, amitriptyline, and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation had the most robust evidence for their effectiveness in alleviating CPSP-induced pain. Further multicenter placebo-controlled research is needed to ascertain the effectiveness of physical therapies, such as acupuncture and virtual reality, and invasive and noninvasive neuromodulation treatments. PERSPECTIVE: This article presents a top-down and bottom-up overview of evidence for the effectiveness of different pharmacological, physical, and neuromodulation treatments of CPSP.

#5636,Updates in the Treatment of Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy,"Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a common toxicity associated with treatment with platinum-based agents, taxanes, vinca alkaloids, and other specific agents. The long-term consequences of this condition can result in decreased patient quality of life and can lead to reduced dose intensity, which can negatively impact disease outcomes. There are currently no evidence-based preventative strategies for CIPN and only limited options for treatment. However, there are several strategies that can be utilized to improve patient experience and outcomes as more data are gathered in the prevention and treatment setting. Before treatment, patient education on the potential side effects of chemotherapy is key, and although trials have been limited, recommending exercise and a healthy lifestyle before and while undergoing chemotherapy may provide some overall benefit. In patients who develop painful CIPN, our approach is to offer duloxetine and titrate up to 60 mg daily. Chemotherapy doses may also need to be reduced if intolerable symptoms develop during treatment. Some patients may also try acupuncture and physical therapy to help address their symptoms, although this can be limited by cost, time commitment, and patient motivation. Additionally, data on these modalities are currently limited, as studies are ongoing. Overall, approaching each patient on an individual level and tailoring treatment options for them based on overall physical condition, their disease burden, goals of care and co-morbid health conditions, and willingness to trial different approaches is necessary when addressing CIPN.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#5651,Early diagnosis improves outcomes in hepatitis C,"Chronic hepatitis C (HCV) infection affects 0.8-1.0% of the UK population, with up to 70% having ongoing chronic infection. HCV is curable but if left untreated can progress to end stage liver disease and potentially hepatocellular carcinoma. HCV management options have changed dramatically over the past five years, with improvement in cure rates and tolerability; cure rates of more than 90% can now be achieved. The main risk factors for acquiring HCV infection in the UK are injecting drug use and sharing drug using equipment. Other risk factors include receipt of blood products in the UK before 1991; tattooing or acupuncture with non-sterile equipment; medical procedures; needlestick injuries and contact with blood from an infected person. Acute hepatitis C infection has mild symptoms only and is likely to go undiagnosed. The estimated diagnosis rate in England is 35%, suggesting that 65% of the total HCV-positive population remains undiagnosed. The most common method of detecting HCV is case finding in high- risk groups. Those who test positive for HCV antibodies should be tested for persisting viral presence through HCV PCR testing - a positive result confirms active infection. GPs can play a major role in identifying those at risk of the disease, which includes patients with known risk factors and those with unexplained abnormal liver function tests, providing information and arranging testing. Patients with confirmed active HCV infection should be referred to the local specialist hepatology or infectious disease service in accordance with locally agreed pathways.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No

#5685,Different Degree Centrality Changes in the Brain after Acupuncture on Contralateral or Ipsilateral Acupoint in Patients with Chronic Shoulder Pain: A Resting-State fMRI Study,"Chronic shoulder pain (CSP) is the third most common musculoskeletal problem. For maximum treatment effectiveness, most acupuncturists usually choose acupoint in the nonpainful side, to alleviate pain or improve shoulder function. This method is named opposite needling, which means acupuncture points on the right side are selected for diseases on the left side and vice versa. However, the underlying neural mechanisms related to treatment are currently unclear. The purpose of this study was to determine whether different mechanisms were observed with contralateral and ipsilateral acupuncture at Tiaokou (ST 38) in patients with unilateral CSP. Twenty-four patients were randomized to the contralateral acupuncture group (contra-group) and the ipsilateral acupuncture group (ipsi-group). The patients received one acupuncture treatment session at ST 38 on the nonpainful or painful sides, respectively. Before and after acupuncture treatment, they underwent functional magnetic resonance scanning. The treatment-related changes in degree centrality (DC) maps were compared between the two groups. We found alleviated pain and improved shoulder function in both groups, but better shoulder functional improvement was observed in the contra-group. Increased DC in the anterior/paracingulate cortex and decreased DC in bilateral postcentral gyri were found in the contra-group, while decreased DC in the bilateral cerebellum and right thalamus was observed in the ipsi-group. Furthermore, the DC value in the bilateral anterior/paracingulate cortex was positively correlated with the treatment-related change in the Constant-Murley score. The current study reveals different changes of DC patterns after acupuncture at contralateral or ipsilateral ST 38 in patients with CSP. Our findings support the hypothesis of acupoint specificity and provide the evidence for acupuncturists to select acupoints for CSP.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes
#5686,Multi-center study for acupuncture combined with Chinese medicine in the treatment of chronic spontaneous urticaria based on the theory of taking shu-stream points when the disease is aggravated,"Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is a common dermatologic disease that seriously affects patient quality of life. The choice of therapy to control the disease and prevent its recurrence has always presented a difficult clinical issue. Previous studies have shown that traditional Chinese medicine is a safe and effective treatment for CSU. Recently, the temporal rhythms of CSU, a disease characterized by intermittent flares of active disease and periods of little or no disease, have attracted the attention of traditional Chinese medicine researchers. We designed a multicenter, randomized, controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of combining a Chinese herbal formulation with acupuncture using shu-stream acupoints applied on the corresponding time meridians during disease exacerbations. We plan to recruit 111 outpatients with CSU aged 18 to 65 years. Participants will be randomized to 1 of the 3 groups: group A, which will be given basic acupuncture and the herbal formulation dangui yinzi; group B, which will be given danggui yinzi and shu-stream acupuncture; and a control group, which will be given danggui yinzi alone. Patients will be treated for 4 weeks and followed for 8 additional weeks. Investigators will evaluate the following parameters: the symptoms and side effects of treatment, quality of life (using the chronic urticaria quality of life questionnaire), and overall patient condition. Each week, patients will also complete the measurement of 7-day urticarial activity score. This is the first use of a combination of shu-stream acupoints and Chinese herbal medicine in the treatment of CSU. If successful, it will prove to be a simple, inexpensive, treatment strategy for solving a difficult clinical problem.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#5707,Effects of childhood trauma exposure and cortisol levels on cognitive functioning among breast cancer survivors,"Cognitive functioning difficultiesin breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy are common, but not all women experience these impairments. Exposure to childhood trauma may impair cognitive functioning following chemotherapy, and these impairments may be mediated by dysregulation of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function and cortisol slope. This study evaluated the association between childhood trauma exposure, cortisol, and cognition in a sample of breast cancer survivors. 56 women completed measures of trauma exposure (the Traumatic Events Survey), salivary cortisol, and self-reported cognitive functioning (the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Cognitive). We examined correlations between childhood trauma exposure and cognitive functioning, then used linear regression to control for factors associated with cognition (age, education, time since chemotherapy, depression, anxiety, and insomnia), and the MacArthur approach to test whether cortisol levels mediated the relationship between trauma and cognitive functioning. 57.1% of the sample had experienced at least one traumatic event in childhood, with 19.6% of the sample witnessing a serious injury, 17.9% experiencing physical abuse, and 14.3% experiencing sexual abuse. Childhood trauma exposure and cognitive functioning were moderately associated (r=-0.29). This association remained even when controlling for other factors associated with cognition; the final model explained 47% of the variance in cognitive functioning. The association between childhood trauma and cognitive functioning was mediated by steeper cortisol slope (partial r=0.35, p=0.02). Childhood trauma exposure is associated with self-reported cognitive functioning among breast cancer survivors and is mediated by cortisol dysregulation. Trauma should be considered, among other factors, in programs aiming to address cognition in this population.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#5712,The psychological intervention and clinical efficacy of Rosenthal effect and acupuncture bleeding on middle-aged and young patients with sudden hearing loss,"Combining traditional Chinese medicine theory and modern medical knowledge, this study explores the pathogenesis of sudden hearing loss in middle-aged and young people. Sixty-four young and middle-aged patients with sudden hearing loss who visited a public tertiary hospital in China are chosen as experimental objects. All experimental patients are broken into an experimental group (n = 32) and a control group (n = 32). The control group receive conventional Western medicine treatment regimen. The experimental group receive select acupoint acupuncture and bloodletting combined with Rosenthal effect for psychological intervention, and both groups have a treatment course of 14 days. The changes in the patient's condition before and after treatment are observed, and the differences in hearing threshold values, tinnitus, and dizziness clinical efficacy before and after treatment are observed and recorded. It evaluates the efficacy using the Anxiety, Depression Scale, and Hope Scale and statistically analyzes the data. The dizziness score of the experimental group decreased rapidly, the treatment onset time was shorter, and the improvement effect on dizziness symptoms was better (P < .05). After 1 month of intervention treatment, the intervention of the experimental group was better (P < .05). The hope level and self-efficacy of both groups of patients were raised in contrast with before treatment (P < .05). After 1 month, the intervention effect of the experimental group was more significant (P < .01). Both groups could improve patient ear blood circulation, but the experimental group had lower plasma viscosity, hematocrit, and red blood cell aggregation index, higher red blood cell deformation index, and more significant improvement effect (P < .05). The effective rates of improving hearing and tinnitus in the experimental group reached 87.5% and 81.5%, and the clinical treatment efficacy was better than that in the control group (P < .05). The level of depression and anxiety in the experimental group remained relatively stable, while that in the control group showed a significant rebound (P < .05). In conclusion, both groups had a certain effect in treating sudden deafness, both of which could effectively improve the patient's hearing. But in contrast with the control group, the experimental group had better clinical efficacy, higher safety, and better psychological intervention results, which is worthy of clinical promotion.",No,No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No
#5722,Complementary and alternative medicine in fibromyalgia and related syndromes,"Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) has gained increasing popularity, particularly among individuals with fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) for which traditional medicine has generally been ineffective. A systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs on CAM studies for FMS was conducted to evaluate the empirical evidence for their effectiveness. Few RCTs achieved high scores on the CONSORT, a standardized evaluation of the quality of methodology reporting. Acupuncture, some herbal and nutritional supplements (magnesium, SAMe) and massage therapy have the best evidence for effectiveness with FMS. Other CAM therapies have either been evaluated in only one RCT with positive results (Chlorella, biofeedback, relaxation), in multiple RCTs with mixed results (magnet therapies), or have positive results from studies with methodological flaws (homeopathy, botanical oils, balneotherapy, anthocyanidins, dietary modifications). Lastly, other CAM therapies have neither well-designed studies nor positive results and are not currently recommended for FMS treatment (chiropractic care).",Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#5744,"Measurable impact of acupuncture on mucosal swelling of inferior turbinates: a prospective, randomized, controlled study","CONCLUSIONS: Sham acupuncture turned out to be more effective than expected. The effect of acupuncture cannot be assessed by optical rhinometry (ORM). OBJECTIVES: In most cases nasal congestion is caused by hypertrophy of the inferior turbinate as a result of allergic and chronic rhinitis. Topical decongestants cause severe side effects. As a consequence, there is an increasing demand for alternative treatment options such as traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). METHODS: A total of 25 patients with nasal congestion due to hypertrophic inferior turbinate were recruited. The mucosal swelling status of the inferior turbinate was assessed by continuous ORM for 20 min. Patients were asked to score the severity of their nasal congestion on a visual analogue scale (VAS) before and 10 and 20 min after acupuncture. Specific verum acupuncture points related to nasal congestion were tested against non-specific control sham acupuncture points. RESULTS: Sham acupuncture improved VAS scores, whereas ORM measured an increase in nasal swelling. The ORM revealed a quicker onset of the effect of verum acupuncture on the nasal blood flow. Also, verum acupuncture reaches its maximum effect in a shorter time period, so that the net reaction time was much shorter. However, ORM could not prove a decongestant effect of verum acupuncture on inferior turbinate.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes
#5754,"Acupressure and Transcutaneous Electrical Acupoint Stimulation for Improving Uremic Pruritus: A Randomized, Controlled Trial","Context • Uremic pruritus, a frequent and compromising symptom for patients with advanced or end-stage renal disease (ESRD), strongly reduces the patient's quality of life. Pruritus may be extremely difficult to control because therapeutic options are limited. Topical products are frequently used for easing pruritus, but their effects are generally temporary and marginal. Although acupressure and electrical-stimulation methods for the application of acupressure have been evaluated separately in terms of pruritus efficiency in different studies, the existence of any difference between the efficacies of the 2 methods has not been assessed yet. Objective • The study intended to test the effectiveness of acupressure and transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation (TEAS) on uremic pruritus in patients who were receiving the routine hemodialysis treatment. Design • The study was a randomized, controlled trial. Setting • The study took place in hemodialysis units located in hemodialysis centers in Turkey. Participants • Participants were patients in the hemodialysis units who were under hemodialysis treatment and had experienced uremic pruritus. Intervention • Participants were randomly assigned to the acupressure group (intervention group), the TEAS group (intervention group), or the control group. For the 2 intervention groups, the treatment was applied 3 ×/wk during the 4 wk of the study on the large intestine (LI-11) acupuncture points in the arm, for a total of 12 sessions. Outcome Measures • The study measured the severity of participants' pruritus using a patient information form and a visual analogue scale (VAS). The data were collected at baseline and posttreatment. Results • A total of 75 patients participated in the study. The results indicated that patients in the acupressure and TEAS groups had significant reductions from baseline to posttreatment in their levels of discomfort from uremic pruritus compared with patients in the control group. However, no differences existed between the acupressure and the TEAS patients in terms of outcome measures. Conclusions • The research team concluded that both acupressure and TEAS applied to hemodialysis patients was effective in reducing uremic pruritus. The study provided support for an alternative method for health care providers in managing hemodialysis patients with symptoms of uremic pruritus.",No,No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No
#5755,What do Cochrane systematic reviews say about interventions for autism spectrum disorders?,"CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) include autistic disorder, Asperger's disorder and pervasive developmental disorder. The manifestations of ASDs can have an important impact on learning and social functioning that may persist during adulthood. The aim here was to summarize the evidence from Cochrane systematic reviews on interventions for ASDs. DESIGN AND SETTING: Review of systematic reviews, conducted within the Discipline of Evidence-Based Medicine, Escola Paulista de Medicina, Universidade Federal de São Paulo. METHODS: We included and summarized the results from Cochrane systematic reviews on interventions for ASDs. RESULTS: Seventeen reviews were included. These found weak evidence of benefits from acupuncture, gluten and casein-free diets, early intensive behavioral interventions, music therapy, parent-mediated early interventions, social skill groups, Theory of Mind cognitive model, aripiprazole, risperidone, tricyclic antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI); this last only for adults. No benefits were found for sound therapies, chelating agents, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, omega-3, secretin, vitamin B6/magnesium and SSRI for children. CONCLUSION: Acupuncture, gluten and casein-free diets, early intensive behavioral interventions, music therapy, parent-mediated early interventions, social skill groups and the Theory of Mind cognitive model seem to have benefits for patients with autism spectrum disorders (very low to low-quality evidence). Aripiprazole, risperidone, tricyclic antidepressants and SSRI (this last only for adults) also showed some benefits, although associated with higher risk of adverse events.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy of magnetic acupressure in reducing pain in cancer patients undergoing BMAB. METHODS: Cancer patients without previous acupuncture or acupressure experience were stratified by the number of prior BMAB and randomized to having magnetic acupressure delivered to either the large intestine 4 (LI4) acupoint or a sham site. The primary study endpoint was the patient's pain intensity rating during the procedure using a visual analogue scale (VAS). RESULTS: Seventy-seven eligible patients received magnetic acupressure: 37 were randomized to treatment at the LI4 site arm and 40 at the designated sham site arm. There was no significant difference between the median pain scores of patients treated at the LI4 site and the sham site (P=0.87). However, severe pain (VAS ≥ 7) was reported in only one patient (2.7%) treated at the LI4 site compared with eight patients (20%) at the sham site (P=0.03). No patients experienced significant magnetic acupressure-related toxicities. CONCLUSION: Magnetic acupressure at the LI4 acupoint requires minimal training and expense and is well tolerated. Although its use did not significantly reduce median pain scores in patients undergoing BMAB, it does appear to reduce the proportion of patients with severe pain associated with this invasive procedure.",No,No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No
#5786,Effectiveness of acupuncture in treatment of facial spasm: a meta-analysis,"CONTEXT: Facial spasm is one of the common facial diseases, especially in the aged. It is mostly characterized by initially progressive, involuntary, irregular, recurrent, clonic, or tonic movements of muscles innervated by the facial nerve on one side. Acupuncture is a low-risk treatment with purported claims of effectiveness for facial spasm. OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of acupuncture in facial spasm comprehensively. DESIGN: The research team conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of all randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that examined the effectiveness of acupuncture for facial spasm. OUTCOME MEASURE(S): The research team categorized results from each of the reviewed studies in two ways: (1) the number of participants who showed a positive response to therapy (total effectiveness rate) and (2) the number of participants who made a full recovery (clinical cure rate). RESULTS: The research team reviewed a total of 13 studies involving 1262 participants with facial spasm. Researchers in China had conducted all studies, and most studies were poor in methodological quality. All studies reported that acupuncture was superior to other treatments, including carbamazepine, mecobalamin, and massage, and the meta-analysis on these low-quality studies yielded similar results. CONCLUSION: Present trials evaluating the efficacy of acupuncture in treatment of facial spasm are mostly poor in methodological quality. These studies showed that acupuncture was superior to other treatments for facial spasm; however, in its meta-analysis, the research team could not draw an affirmative conclusion as to the benefits of acupuncture due to the poor methodological quality and localized population of the included trials.

Although a multitude of complementary therapies, such as acupuncture, are applied in reproductive medicine, no information is available with regard to the application of massage as an adjuvant therapy in assisted-reproduction techniques (ARTs). OBJECTIVES: This study was intended to assess the effectiveness of a deep relaxation (andullation) therapy based on oscillating vibrations when used prior to embryo transfer (ET) in in vitro fertilization (IVF) cryo-cycles. DESIGN: The research team designed a retrospective, observational study. Participants willing to undergo the massage treatment were allocated to the intervention (andullation) group. SETTING: The study was performed at the IVF Centers Prof. Zech-Bregenz in Bregenz, Austria. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 267 IVF patients, with a mean age of 36.3 y, participated in this single-center study. INTERVENTION: All patients receiving a transfer of vitrified and warmed blastocysts between January and December 2012 were included in the evaluation. Prior to ET, the andullation group received a standardized program of therapy-a 30-min, deep relaxation massage on an oscillating (vibrating) device, whereas the control group did not. OUTCOME MEASURES: To determine efficacy, the primary outcomes that the study measured were (1) pregnancy rates (PRs), by testing urine and obtaining a positive β-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG); and (2) ongoing, pregnancies (oPR), by observation of fetal heartbeat and birth rates (BR) as well as miscarriage rates. The patients' medical histories and types of infertility as well as the quality of the embryo transfers (ETs) were evaluated. RESULTS: In patients using the massage therapy prior to ET, significantly higher PRs, oPRs, and BRs were observed compared with the control group-PR: 58.9% vs 41.7%, P<.05; oPR: 53.6% vs 33.2%, P<.01; and BR: 32.0% vs 20.3%, P<.05. No differences were detected among groups for patients' ages, hormonal substitution protocols, endometrium structures and buildups, quality of transferred embryos, or quality of transfers. No adverse effects were noted in the massage group. CONCLUSIONS: The research team's results suggested that andullation therapy prior to blastocyst transfer in a cryo-cycle improves embryo implantation, most likely due to a reduction in stress (ie, a relaxation effect on patients), a reduction in uterine contractions, and, probably, an enhancement of the blood flow in the abdominal region. These findings provide support for use of andullation as a complementary therapy for ART.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#5811,Electroacupuncture for Poststroke Spasticity: Results of a Pilot Pragmatic Randomized Controlled Trial,"CONTEXT: People with spasticity that occurred between 30 days and one year after stroke onset with a baseline Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) ≥1. OBJECTIVES: To determine the practicality of a pragmatic parallel-group open-labeled randomized controlled trial and to collect preliminary data of effectiveness and safety of electroacupuncture (EA) for poststroke spasticity. METHODS: Eligible participants were randomly allocated to the intervention group (EA plus usual care) or the control group (usual care alone) at a 1:1 ratio with block sizes of six. Participants received EA three times a week for four weeks, then were followed up for another four weeks. Participants' retention and adherence in the trial were assessed to determine the practicality of trial design. Clinical outcome measures were the change scores of MAS, Fugl-Meyer Assessment of motor performance and Barthel Index, and adverse events. RESULTS: Seventy-two people were screened for eligibility, and 30 of them were recruited and randomized. At the end, 25 participants followed the trial protocol and were included in our final data analyses using an intention-to-treat approach. No significant between-group difference was detected for the change scores of MAS, Fugl-Meyer Assessment, or Barthel Index at the end of treatment or end of follow-up. Eighteen participants reported 37 adverse events, but none of the participants was deemed related to EA. CONCLUSION: It is feasible to conduct a full-scale trial to precisely evaluate the effectiveness and safety of EA for treating poststroke spasticity; however, longer treatment and follow-up phases should be considered in the full-scale trial.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#5819,"Auricular acupuncture for drug dependence: an open-label randomized investigation on clinical outcomes, health-related quality of life, and patient acceptability","CONTEXT: Substance abuse has been prevalent in Malaysia for many years and currently represents one of the main concerns to its society. The limitations of conventional therapies have resulted in efforts to explore the potentia of complementary therapies in the management of drug addiction. The evidence for auricular acupuncture (AA) as a potential complementary therapy for drug addiction is still limited and inconclusive. OBJECTIVE: The study intended (1) to compare the clinical outcomes of methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) alone and MMT plus AA (MMT+AA) with regard to the daily methadone dose, number of cigarettes smoked/wk, relapse rates, and withdrawal symptoms; (2) to evaluate health-related quality of life (HR QoL) pre- and postintervention; and (3) to determine participants' acceptance of AA therapy. DESIGN: The research team designed this study to be prospective, longitudinal, open-labeled, and randomized, with one intervention group (AA group) and one control group. SETTING: The settings were three MMT centers in Terengganu, Malaysia: (1) the Methadone Maintenance Treatment (MMT) Center, Hospital Sultanah Nur Zahirah; (2) the MMT Center, Marang Health Clinic; and (3) the MMT Center, Seberang Takir Health Clinic. PARTICIPANTS: Participants were individuals who were enrolled in the three MMT programs. INTERVENTION: After randomization, the intervention group received MMT+AA while the control group received MMT only. Participants in the AA group underwent concurrent AA sessions for 8 wk. OUTCOME MEASURES: All outcomes were evaluated using questionnaires that the research team developed and WHOQOL-BREF. Data were analysed employing descriptive and nonparametric statistics (SPSS v16). RESULTS: A total of 97, eligible, male patients consented to participation (MMT = 42; MMT+AA = 55; median age = 36.0 y; Malay ethnicity = 97.9%). After screening for dropouts, the data from only 69 participants were considered for postintervention analysis (MMT = 40; MMT+AA = 29). At preintervention, participants differed significantly by HR QoL profile and the frequency of withdrawal symptoms (better for MMT participants). Postintervention, all groups reported significantly reduced numbers of cigarettes smoked and a reduced methadone dose (P < .05), whereas no significant difference was detected for other parameters. No difference for relapse rate was detected between the groups. On separate group analysis, only the number of cigarettes was significantly lower for MMT+AA participants, whereas apart from methadone dose, all other parameters had significantly improved over time in the MMT+AA cohort. The additional AA therapy also demonstrated favorable acceptance and tolerable side effects. CONCLUSION: Findings implied that AA could be beneficial as an adjunct to MMT in managing addiction, but the effectiveness of AA still requires further extensive investigation.",No,No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No
#5820,Acustimulation wristbands for the relief of chemotherapy-induced nausea,"CONTEXT: Substantial evidence suggests that acupuncture-point stimulation may be effective in controlling side effects of chemotherapy. OBJECTIVE: To examine the efficacy of an acustimulation wristband for the relief of chemotherapy-induced nausea. DESIGN: Randomized clinical trial using a 3-level crossover design. SETTING: Three outpatient oncology clinics in the northeastern United States. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-five women and 2 men who experienced moderate or more severe nausea following their first chemotherapy treatment. INTERVENTION: We compared active acustimulation of the Pericardium 6 (PC-6) point on the ventral surface of the wrist with sham acustimulation (a corresponding point on the posterior surface of the wrist). A control group received no acustimulation. OUTCOME MEASURES: Severity of nausea and quantity of antiemetic medication used. RESULTS: No statistically significant differences in average severity of nausea were observed between the 3 interventions. However, the data showed a difference close to statistical significance in the severity of delayed nausea reported during active acustimulation compared to no acustimulation (P <.06). In addition, patients took fewer antinausea pills during the active-acustimulation cycle of this experiment compared to the no-acustimulation phase (P < .05). CONCLUSION: Findings on the efficacy of an acustimulation band for the control of chemotherapy-induced nausea are positive but not conclusive. These findings provide ample justification for further study of acustimulation in clinical oncology.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#5852,Unique immunomodulation by electro-acupuncture in humans possibly via stimulation of the autonomic nervous system,"Cumulative evidence suggests that immunologic responses are under the regulation of the autonomic nervous system. Since acupuncture has recently been reported to modulate the autonomic nervous system, we investigated the possibility that acupuncture eventually modulates the immune system. In the present study, electro-acupuncture was applied in young volunteer subjects. As for the proportions of granulocytes and lymphocytes in the blood, there were three groups: (1) granulocytosis and lymphocytopenia; (2) granulocytopenia and lymphocytosis; and (3) normal pattern. Interestingly, with the administration of acupuncture, the status of subjects with relatively low levels of granulocytes and high levels of lymphocytes shifted to Group 1, whereas that of subjects with high levels of granulocytes and low levels of lymphocytes shifted to Group 2. In other words, acupuncture tended to normalize the pattern of leukocytes. We confirmed that acupuncture induced parasympathetic nerve stimulation, resulting in a decrease in the heart rate. These results suggest possible mechanisms underlying how acupuncture ameliorates the condition of patients with many chronic diseases.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#5854,Phase II Randomized Trial of Acupuncture-Like Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation to Prevent Radiation-Induced Xerostomia in Head and Neck Cancer Patients,"Current evidence indicates that acupuncture-like transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (ALTENS) can provide sustained benefit for established radiation-induced xerostomia (RIX) symptoms. This is further being evaluated by comparing it with standard treatment (pilocarpine) in a randomized controlled trial. This report studies the potential effectiveness of xerostomia prevention using ALTENS delivered concomitantly with radiotherapy administered to head and neck cancer patients. Sixty patients were randomized to either the treatment group (n = 30) that received ALTENS daily with radiotherapy or the control group (n = 26) that had standard mouth care only. Stimulated and basal unstimulated whole saliva production (WSP) plus RIX symptoms visual analogue score (RIXVAS) were assessed at specific time points. Generalized linear models and generalized estimating equations were used for analysis. RIXVAS at 3 months follow-up after therapy completion was used as the primary study endpoint. The mean RIXVAS for the ALTENS intervention at 3 months was 39.8, which was not significantly different from the control arm value of 40.5. There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups for their mean RIXVAS and WSP at all assessment time points. In conclusion, there was no significant difference in mean WSP and RIXVAS between the two groups, so ALTENS is not recommended as a prophylactic intervention.",No,No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No
#5855,Effects of Acupressure on Symptoms Relief and Improving Sleep Quality in Pediatric Patients With Allergic Rhinitis,"Current pharmacological management of allergic rhinitis cannot completely provide relief from the symptoms and is usually accompanied by undesirable side effects. Complementary and alternative medicine approach has been evaluated and applied for allergic rhinitis frequently. We aim to investigate whether acupressure could be used as daily nursing care practice to reduce the severity of allergic rhinitis symptoms and improve sleep quality in pediatric patients with allergic rhinitis. Patients were divided into the acupressure and control groups randomly. Acupressure on 6 the acupoints was administered at home every night for 4 weeks in the acupressure group after attending a training program. Participants in the control group maintained their daily routine. A questionnaire was used to collect demographic and clinical characteristics, and to assess the symptom scores and sleep quality at baseline, week 2, and week 4 after intervention. Results of the generalized estimating equation model showed there were significant group effects on the total nasal symptom scores, sneezing, nasal congestion, itching of nose and palate, and watery eyes over the study period (all Ps < .05). From baseline to 2 weeks, all the aforementioned symptoms and red eyes, sleep quality, and allergic rhinitis classification more improved in the acupressure group than in the control group and the effect in the acupressure group was maintained through 4 weeks after intervention. Our results showed a significant reduction in the symptoms of allergic rhinitis and improvement in sleep quality after acupressure treatment with no adverse effects.

#5896,[P6 acupoint injection reduced postoperative nausea and vomiting],"Despite improvements in anesthetic techniques postoperative vomiting still remains a problem, particularly in ambulant outpatients, and when an opioid is given before or during anesthesia. Anti-emetic are of limited value and often cause drowsiness or other side effects. We report a study in which a simple acupuncture procedure was used in patients undergoing fraction D & C under standard intravenous anesthesia. Sixty-four patients were included and allocated randomly into one of the two groups: control group receiving standard fentanyl-valium-thiopentone anesthesia alone, and the other group receiving injection of 3 mL normal saline into the P6 acupuncture point after the anesthesia. Ten out of the 32 control patients experienced nausea or vomiting compared with only 2 out of 32 patients receiving acupoint injection. The reduction in nausea was significant.

#5897,[Clinical efficacy of antagonistic needling therapy on post-stroke lower limb spasticity and its effect on muscle morphology],"OBJECTIVE: To observe the effects of antagonistic needling therapy on lower limb spasticity and the muscle morphology of the tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius in patients with stroke. METHODS: A total of 100 patients with post-stroke lower limb spasticity were randomly divided into an antagonistic needling group (50 cases, 1 case dropped out) and a routine acupuncture group (50 cases, 1 case dropped out). Both groups received basic treatment and rehabilitation training. The routine acupuncture group was treated with scalp acupuncture at anterior oblique line of vertex-temporal and vertex lateral line 1, combined with body acupuncture at Jianyu (LI15), Hegu (LI4), Zusanli (ST36), Taichong (LR3), etc. on the affected side, with Quchi (LI11) and Hegu (LI4), Zusanli (ST36) and Fenglong (ST40), Yanglingquan (GB34) and Taichong (LR3) connected to an electroacupuncture device, using disperse wave at 2 Hz of frequency. The antagonistic needling group used the same scalp and upper limb acupoints as the routine acupuncture group, with additional antagonistic needling on the lower limb at Yanglingquan (GB34), Qiuxu (GB40), Jiexi (ST41), and Xuanzhong (GB39) on the affected side, with Quchi (LI11) and Hegu (LI4), Yanglingquan (GB34) and Qiuxu (GB40), Jiexi (ST41), and Xuanzhong (GB39) connected to an electroacupuncture device, using disperse wave at 2 Hz of frequency. Both groups received treatment once daily for 6 consecutive days per course, with a total of 4 courses. The modified Ashworth scale (MAS), Holden functional ambulation classification (FAC), lower limb Fugl-Meyer assessment (FMA), composite spasticity scale (CSS), and musculoskeletal ultrasound parameters (thickness and fiber length of the tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius, and pennation angle of the gastrocnemius on both sides) were evaluated before and after treatment. Clinical efficacy was compared between the two groups. RESULTS: Compared before treatment, the MAS grades and CSS scores were decreased in both groups after treatment (P<0.01), with greater reductions in the antagonistic needling group (P<0.05, P<0.01). FAC grades and FMA scores were increased in both groups after treatment (P<0.01, P<0.05), with greater improvements in the antagonistic needling group (P<0.05). The muscle thickness, fiber length of the tibialis anterior, the muscle thickness, fiber length and pennation angle of the gastrocnemius on the affected side were improved in both groups after treatment (P<0.01), with greater improvements in the antagonistic needling group (P<0.01, P<0.05). On the unaffected side, these parameters were also increased after treatment in both groups (P<0.01, P<0.05), but the antagonistic needling group showed smaller increases than the routine acupuncture group (P<0.01, P<0.05). The total effective rate in the antagonistic needling group was 91.8% (45/49), higher than 81.6% (40/49) in the routine acupuncture group (P<0.05).

#5905,[Effects of combined transdermal acupoint electric stimulation and isoflurane anesthesia on isoflurane-induced hypotension and tissue oxygen metabolism in patients undergoing craniotomy],"OBJECTIVE: To observe the effects of combined transdermal acupoint electric stimulation and isoflurane anesthesia on isoflurane-induced hypotension and tissue oxygen metabolism in patients undergoing craniotomy. METHODS: Forty-two patients with brain tumor of ASA physical status I or II and scheduled for elective surgery were randomly divided into two groups. The craniotomy was undergoing in Group A with isoflurane anesthesia, while in Group B, with combined transdermal acupoint electric stimulation (TAES) and isoflurane anesthesia. Isoflurane induced hypotension was performed in both groups by augmenting the concentration of isoflurane to lower the mean arterial pressure than before anesthesia for 30%-40% and maintain for 30-45 mins. The tissue oxygen metabolism, blood gas and arterial lactic acid level before, during and after hypotension were monitored by Swan-Ganz floating catheterization. RESULTS: As compared with before hypotension, the pulmonary arterial and mixed with venous blood oxygen saturation lowered and oxygen supply lowered, and oxygen uptake increased significantly in both groups (P < 0.05), but the extent of changes in oxygen metabolic criteria in Group B were all lesser than those in Group A (P < 0.05).

METHODS: Eighteen male New Zealand white rabbits were randomly divided into a sham operation group, a model group and an EA group, 6 rabbits in each group. Based on the autoimmune theory, MC model was established by embedding autogenous nucleus pulposus in the rabbits of the model group and the EA group, based on autoimmunity. After successful modeling, EA was applied at bilateral ""Jiaji"" (EX-B 2) of L(5) and L(6) in the EA group, with disperse-dense wave, 2 Hz/15 Hz in frequency and 1 mA in current intensity, 20 min a time, once a day, 1-day interval was taken after continuous 6-day intervention, for 4 weeks totally. Before and after modeling, as well as before and after intervention, the comprehensive response score was observed. After modeling and intervention, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to observe the signal intensity of intervertebral disc and cartilage endplate. After intervention, the morphology of chondrocytes of cartilage endplate was observed by HE staining; the positive expression of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motif-5 (ADAMTS5) and Aggrecan in the cartilage endplate was detected by immunohistochemistry; the levels of inflammatory factors i.e. interleukin-1β (1L-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in the cartilage endplate were detected by ELISA; the protein expression of ADAMTS5, Aggrecan, matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13), IL-1β and TNF-α in the cartilage endplate was detected by Western blot. RESULTS: Compared with the sham operation group, in the model group, the comprehensive response score was decreased (P<0.01); L(5)/L(6) intervertebral disc and the cancellous bones of endplate vertebral body showed low signal and unclear boundary; the chondrocytes of the cartilage endplate increased significantly, the cells were enlarged and hypertrophic, and the nuclei were wrinkled and clustered; the positive expression of ADAMTS5 as well as the levels of IL-1β and TNF-α were increased (P<0.01), while the positive expression of Aggrecan was decreased (P<0.01) in the cartilage endplate; the protein expression of ADAMTS5, MMP-13, IL-1β and TNF-α was increased (P<0.01), while that of Aggrecan was decreased (P<0.01) in the cartilage endplate. Compared with the model group, in the EA group, the comprehensive response score was increased (P<0.01); the signal of L(5)/L(6) intervertebral disc and the cancellous bones of endplate vertebral body was enhanced; the chondrocytes of the cartilage endplate were reduced, the nuclei were slightly crumpled and scattered; the positive expression of ADAMTS5 as well as the levels of IL-1β and TNF-α were decreased (P<0.05, P<0.01), while the positive expression of Aggrecan was increased (P<0.01) in the cartilage endplate; the protein expression of ADAMTS5, MMP-13, IL-1β and TNF-α was decreased (P<0.05, P<0.01), while that of Aggrecan was increased (P<0.05) in the cartilage endplate.

#5925,[Effects of electroacupuncture at different acupoints on apoptosis and the expression of miRNAs in myocardial cells in rats model of myocardial ischemia],"OBJECTIVE: To observe the effects of electroacupuncture (EA) at different acupoints on apoptosis-related serum and expression of microRNA (miRNA) in rats with myocardial ischemia, so as to explore its mechanism of action. METHODS: A total of 48 male Wistar rats were randomly divided into a normal group, a model group, a Neiguan group and a acupoint compatibility group, 12 rats in each group. Isoprenaline hydrochloride (ISO) with a daily dose of 2 mg/kg was subcutaneously injected for 14 days to establish the myocardial ischemia model in the model group, Neiguan group and acupoint compatibility group. Rats in the normal group were subcutaneously injected with an equal volume of normal saline. After modeling, rats in the Neiguan group were treated with EA at ""Neiguan"" (PC 6), while rats in the acupoint compatibility group were treated with EA at ""Guanyuan"" (CV 4), ""Zusanli"" (ST 36) and ""Neiguan"" (PC 6). Rats in the normal group and model group were treated with immobilization, once day for 21 days. The contents of creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and endothelin-1 (ET-1) in serum were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); apoptosis index (AI) of myocardial cells was detected by TUNEL method; the expressions of miRNA-1, miRNA-133, miRNA-208 and miRNA-499 were detected by real-time PCR method. RESULTS: Compared with the normal group, the serum CK-MB, VCAM-1 and ET-1 were significantly increased in the model group, Neiguan group and acupoint compatibility group (all P < 0.01), and the apoptosis index was significantly increased (all P < 0.01). The CK-MB, VCAM-1 and ET-1 in the Neiguan group and acupoint compatibility group were significantly lower than those in the model group (all P < 0.01); the AI was reduced, which was more significant in the acupoint compatibility group (P < 0.05). Compared with the normal group, the expression of miRNA-133 was reduced (P < 0.01) and those of miRNA-208, miRNA-1 and miRNA-499 were significantly increased in the model group (all P < 0.01). Compared with the model group, the expression of miRNA-133 was increased (both P < 0.01) and that of miRNA-208, miRNA-1 and miRNA-499 were significantly reduced (all P < 0.01) in the Neiguan group and acupoint compatibility group. Compared with the Neiguan group, the expression of miRNA-133 was increased (P < 0.01) and those of miRNA-208, miRNA-1 and miRNA-499 were significantly reduced in the acupoint compatibility group (P < 0.01, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: EA at acupoints, especially acupoint compatibility group, could effectively prevent and treat myocardial ischemia, and the protective effect is possibly correlated to the double regulation on increasing the expression of miRNA-133 and inhibiting the expression of miRNA-1, miRNA-208, miRNA-499.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No

#5947,[Effects of electroacupuncture stimulation of "Neiguan" (PC 6) and "Shenmen" (HT7) on contents of 5-hydroxytryptamine in hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus region and serum in hyperlipidemia rats with acute myocardial infarction],"OBJECTIVE: To observe the effects of electroacupuncture (EA) stimulation of ""Neiguan""(PC 6) and ""Shenmen"" (HT 7) on 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) levels in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) region of hypothalamus and serum in hyperlipidemia rats with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). METHODS: A total of 80 SD rats with hyperlipidemia were used in the present study. Among them, 20 rats were randomly selected to be the sham-operation group, and the rest 60 cases were used to make the AMI model by occlusion of the anterior descending branch of the left coronary artery. The 60 rats who were identified to be successful in AMI were randomly divided into model group, EA-PC 6 group and EA-HT 7 group (20 rats/group). EA (2 Hz, 2 mA) was applied to bilateral PC 6 and HT 7 for 20 min, once daily for 5 days. The contents of 5-HT of hypothalamic PVN region and serum were examined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and radioimmunoassay, respectively. RESULTS: Following AMI, marked myocardial injury (swelling, breakage, disappearance of local transverse striations and necrosis of myocytes) with infiltration of neutrophil granulocytes was found in the model group, while in both EA-PC 6 group and EA-HT 7 group, moderate swelling (no breakage) of fewer myocardial fibers with mild infiltration of neutrophil granulocytes was found, indicating a marked improvement of myocardial injury after EA treatment. Compared with the sham-operation group, the content of 5-HT was obviously decreased in the hypothalamic PVN region and significantly increased in serum in the model group (P < 0.01). After EA intervention, the content of 5-HT was considerably up-regulated in the hypothalamic PVN region and apparently down-regulated in serum in both EA-PC 6 and EA-HT 7 groups in comparison with the model group (P < 0.01). No significant differences were found between EA-PC 6 and EA-HT 7 groups in regulating hypothalamic and serum 5-HT levels (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: EA stimulation of both PC 6 and HT 7 can relieve acute ischemic injury of the myocardium in hyperlipidemia rats, which is probably partially related to its effect in promoting the release of 5-HT from the hypothalamic PVN region.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No

METHODS: Seventy-two chemotherapy patients who met the inclusive criteria were randomly divided into an observation group (38 cases) and a control group (34 cases). The patients in the observation group were treated with electroacupuncture at Neiguan (PC 6) and Jianshi (PC 5) combined with granisetron injection; the patients in the control group were treated with electroacupuncture at sham-point 1 and sham- point 2, and the rest treatment was identical to the observation group. After 3-day treatment, the clinical indices including times of vomiting and severity of nausea, etc. were observed in the two groups. RESULTS: (1) At the acute stage within 24 h, the times of vomiting in the two groups were not significantly different (P>0.05); at the delay stage, the severity of nausea was significantly higher in the control group (P<0.05). (2) As for the comprehensive efficacy and rate of complete control, there was no obvious difference between the two groups at the acute stage (P>0.05); while in the delay stage, the rate of complete control in the observation group was superior to that in the control group (P<0.01). (3) Compared before and after the treatment, serum levels of 5-HT and DA were evidently reduced in the observation group (both P<0.05), while those in the control group were not significantly changed after treatment (both P>0.05).

#5956,Effects of electroacupuncture on hippocampal and cortical apoptosis in a mouse model of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury,"OBJECTIVE: To observe the effects of electroacupuncture on hippocampal and cortical apoptosis in a mouse model of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury. METHODS: Mouse models established by repeated cerebral ischemia-reperfusion, followed by electroacupuncture at Shenshu, Geshu, and Baihui points. The control group mice were intragastrically administered Hydergine. On day 1 and 7 post-treatment, hippocampal and cortical apoptosis was detected by terminal-deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL), and apoptosis images in the hippocampal CA1 zone and cortical area were analyzed. RESULTS: In the model group, apoptotic cells were detected one day after treatment and some cellular fibers were disarrayed. By day 7 post-treatment, there was an increase in the number of apoptotic cells in the hippocampal CA1 region. In addition, there were apoptotic cells in the cortical area, the cortical layers were thinner with localized neuronal loss and sieve-like lymphocyte infiltration, as well as glial cell proliferation and visible infarct lesions. However, in the Hydergine and electroacupuncture groups, there was a small number of apoptotic cells. At 7 days post-treatment in the model group, field number, numerical density on area, and surface density were increased. However, in the Hydergine and electroacupuncture groups these parameters were decreased (P < 0.01), with a significant difference between the two treatment groups (P < 0.01).

#5971,Effects of moxibustion at bilateral Feishu (BL13) and Xinshu (BL15) combined with benazepril on myocardial cells apoptosis index and apoptosis-related proteins cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor in rats with chronic heart failure,"OBJECTIVE: To observe the effects of moxibustion at bilateral Feishu (BL13) and Xinshu (BL15) combined with benazepril on myocardial cells apoptosis index, the expression levels of apoptosis-related proteins cytochrome c (Cyt-C) and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) in chronic heart failure (CHF) rats. METHODS: Sixty-five rats were randomly divided into normal group () and model-I group (). After modeling, CHF rats in model-I group were divided into model group, moxibustion group, benazepril group, moxibustion plus benazepril group (abbreviated as aibei group, the same below), 10 rats in each group. Echocardiogram index was examined by echocardiography. Hemodynamic indices were measured by rat cardiac function meter. Serum B-type brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Myocardial cells apoptosis index was detected by terminal-deoxynucleoitidyl transferase mediated nick end labeling staining. Pathological changes of myocardial tissues were observed by hematoxylin and eosin staining. The expression levels of Cyt-C and AIF in myocardial tissues were detected by Western blot. RESULTS: Compared with normal group, ejection fraction and left ventricular diameter shortening rate in model-Ⅰ group were significantly reduced, myocardial cells of rats in model group exhibited unclear transverse striations, cells swellings and vacuoles, cardiac functions were deteriorated, serum BNP level, myocardial cells apoptosis index, and the expression levels of Cyt-C and AIF were significantly increased. Compared with model group, myocardial cells of rats in moxibustion group, benazepril group, and aibei group were dyed more evenly, muscle fibers were arranged relatively neatly, cardiac functions were improved, serum BNP level, myocardial cells apoptosis index, and the expression levels of Cyt-C and AIF were significantly decreased. Compared with aibei group, cardiac functions were worsened, myocardial cells apoptosis index, and the expression levels of Cyt-C and AIF were increased. CONCLUSION: Moxibustion at bilateral Feishu (BL13) and Xinshu (BL15) combined with benazepril could improve CHF better than moxibustion at bilateral Feishu (BL13) and Xinshu (BL15) or benazepril alone. The mechanisms might be that they can inhibit the expressions of Cyt-C and AIF, and inhibit the apoptosis of cardiomyocytes.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No

#6171,[Effect of electroacupunctu-e intervention on serum IL-17 and IL-23 contents in rheumatoid arthritis rats],"OBJECTIVE: To observe the influence of electroacupuncture (EA) stimulation of ""Zusanli"" (ST 36) and ""Kunlun"" (BL 60) on serum and knee-joint IL-17 and IL-23 contents in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) rats so as to study its underlying mechanism in improving RA. METHODS: Male Wistar rats were randomly allocated to normal control, RA model, EA and Prednisolone groups (n = 8 in each group). The RA model was established by intra-planta injection of incomplete Freund's adjuvant and type II collagen. EA (2 Hz/100 Hz,1-2 mA)was applied to bilateral ""Zusanli""(ST 36) and ""Kunlun""(BL 60) for 30 min, once daily for 10 days. The rats' ankle diameter was measured, and IL-17 and IL-23 contents in the serum and the knee-joint cavity were assayed by ELISA and Western blot, respectively. RESULTS: In comparison with the normal control group, the rats' ankle diameter, serum IL-17 and IL-23 contents and knee-joint IL-17 and IL-23 protein expression levels were significantly increased in the model group (P < 0.05). After EA and Prednisolone treatment, compared with the model group, all the rats' ankle diameter, serum IL-17 and IL-23 contents and knee-joint IL-17 and IL-23 protein expression levels were decreased remarkably (P < 0.05). No obvious differences were found between the EA and Prednisolone groups in the aforementioned indexes (P > 0.05), except IL-17 protein expression level (being markedly lower in the Prednisolone group than in the EA group).

#6203,[Kinetic mechanism of electroacupuncture for stair climbing in knee osteoarthritis patients],"OBJECTIVE: To observe the kinetic change that reflects joint loading in different planes during stair climbing in knee osteoarthritis (KOA) after electroacupuncture (EA) by three-dimensional motion analysis, so as to provide reference for its biomechanical mechanism treated with acupuncture. METHODS: Forty KOA patients, in accordance with the random number table, were assigned into an observation group and a control group, 20 cases in each one and finally 18 cases completed. Acupoints in the observation group were Neixiyan (EX-LE 4), Dubi (ST 35), Yanglingquan (GB 34), Yinlingquan (SP 9), Xuehai (SP 10), Liangqiu (ST 34) and Zusanli (ST 36); points in the control groups were located about 2 cm next to the above acupoints with shallow acupuncture. EA was connected at Neixiyan (EX-LE 4) and Yinlingquan (SP 9), Liangqiu (ST 34) and Yanglingquan (GB 34). The frequency was 2 Hz with continuous wave in the observation group and there was no current in the control group for the corresponding points. All the treatment was given for 3 weeks, totally 11 times. Climbing stairs gait was measured before and after treatment. Velocities and kinetic parameters during ascending and descending stairs were analyzed, including flexion and extension peak torques of hip, knee, ankle on the vertical plane, external knee adduction moment on the coronal plane. RESULTS: After treatment in the observation group, velocities during ascending and descending stairs significantly increased (P<0.05, P<0.01); maximal ankle plantar flexor moments during ascending and descending stairs and the second peak external knee adduction moment (PEKAM2) during ascending stairs significantly increased (P<0.05, P<0.01). After treatment in the control group, the first peak external knee adduction moment (PEKAM1) and PEKAM2 during descending stairs were less than those before treatment (P<0.05, P<0.01). In the observation group, the difference value (DV) of velocity before and after treatment was positively correlated to DV in the torque of ankle plantar flexors during ascending stairs in the observation group (r=0.598，P<0.01). Excluding the impact of velocity, the DV of the maximal torque of ankle plantar flexors during ascending stairs didn't show difference in the observation group (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: EA can increase the velocities of ascending and descending stairs of KOA patients. It improves the loading capacity of knee joint on both sagittal and coronary planes. But its effect during ascending may be correlated with the increase of velocity. The mechanism of different effects between EA and minimal acupuncture on joint moments is still unclear and warrants further study.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes

#6571,Evidence mapping and overview of systematic reviews of the effects of acupuncture therapies,"OBJECTIVE: To provide a route map regarding systematic reviews (SRs) of acupuncture therapies that will meet two goals: (1) to identify areas in which more or better evidence is required and (2) to identify acupuncture applications that, although proven effective, remain underused in practice, and thus warrant more effective knowledge dissemination. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: We included SRs that conducted meta-analyses (MAs) of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) for this overview. INFORMATION SOURCES: We searched for SRs without language restrictions from January 2015 to November 2020 in four Chinese electronic databases and Epistemonikos database. And we also searched for newly published RCTs that were eligible for selected best SRs in PubMed, Medline, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase and four Chinese electronic databases from its lasted search dates to November 2020. SYNTHESIS OF RESULTS: We reanalysed the selected MAs if new primary studies were added. We used random-effect model to calculate the overall effect. RESULTS: Our search identified 120 SRs published in the last 5 years addressing acupuncture therapies across 12 therapeutic areas and 77 diseases and conditions. The SRs included 205 outcomes and involved 138 995 participants from 1402 RCTs. We constructed 77 evidence matrices, including 120 SRs and their included RCTs in the Epistemonikos database. Seventy-seven SRs represented the effect estimate of acupuncture therapies. Finally, we system summarised the areas of possible underutilisation of acupuncture therapies (high or moderate certainty evidence of large or moderate effects), and the areas of warranting additional investigation of acupuncture therapies (low or very low certainty evidence of moderate or large effects).

#6575,Current state of research on acupuncture for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: A scoping review,"OBJECTIVE: To provide an overview of the range and characteristics of existing evidence, research gaps, and future research priorities in treating amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) with acupuncture. METHOD: Clinical studies on acupuncture treatment for ALS were searched in 9 databases and two websites. Two independent researchers screened the literature according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria; extracted the demographic data, interventions, and significant findings of the studies; and comprehensively analyzed the characteristics and limitations of the included articles. RESULTS: A total of 2,326 studies were retrieved, of which 92 were included. Most of the studies were conducted in China, with the number increasing over time. Study designs included case reports, case series, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and before-and-after studies, among which case reports were the most frequently used. A total of 1,388 patients were enrolled, of whom 1,031 had ALS, 274 had progressive bulbar palsy (PBP), 60 had progressive muscle atrophy (PMA), and 23 had primary lateral sclerosis (PLS). Acupuncture interventions included body acupuncture, electroacupuncture, acupoint injection, scalp acupuncture, acupoint massage, Sa-am acupuncture, needle-embedding therapy, auricular acupuncture, venom pharmacopuncture therapy, plum blossom needling, acupoint paste, electroacupuncture, and needle warming through moxibustion. The most frequently used acupoints were ST36, LI4, SP6, and LI11. Acupuncture is often applied in combination with other treatments, such as herbal or Western medicine. The frequency of treatment ranged from once a month to three times a day, and the duration of treatment ranged from 5 days to 3 years. Clinical symptoms, muscle strength, and effective rates were the most frequently used outcomes. Most studies reported significant efficacy, and only a few studies reported adverse events explicitly. CONCLUSION: Evidence gaps include poor study design, complex interventions, limited significance of the selected outcomes, and limited study reporting. The promotion of acupuncture treatment for ALS still faces several obstacles. Rigorous study design and conduct, standardized intervention and outcome measurements, and normative reporting are needed to investigate the efficacy and safety of acupuncture treatment for ALS.",No,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No

#6601,Effectiveness of moxibustion for exercise-induced fatigue--a systematic review for randomized controlled trials,"OBJECTIVE: To review and assess the effect of single moxibustion for exercise-induced fatigue: (EIF). METHODS: Computer-search for 8 medical databases and 5 clinical trail registries were conducted for: randomized controlled trials (RCTs), added with hand-search for 10 Chinese acupuncture-moxibustion journals and additional references. Data from included RCTs were pooled by RevMan5.1. Methodology quality of RCTs was judged by Cochrane Collaboration assessment tool while quality of primary outcomes was evaluated by GRADE3.2. RESULTS: Five RCTs were finally included, all reported in small sample size with high risk of: bias. Comparisons on single moxibustion and rest relief (without treatment) were studied. Six outcomes were reported, all favored moxibustion to rest relief for EIF. Primary outcomes showed as rating of perceived exertion (RPE) with mean difference (MD)=-0.49, 95% confidence interval (CI) [-0.80, -0.19], 800-m race performance with MD=-2.21, 95% CI [-3.57, -0.85], and Harvard Step Index (HSI) with MD=14.75, 95% CI [8.35, 21.15]. Moreover, all primary outcomes as RPE, 800-m race performance and HSI were rated low quality. CONCLUSIONS: Single moxibustion might be considered effective for EIF. However, due to small samples of included RCTs, high risk of bias among studies and poor quality of primary outcomes and subjects restricted to Chinese athletes only, these results present limitation, and should be taken with caution for practice. More large-size studies with rigorous design are warranted to further test effectiveness of moxibustion for EIF.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#6604,Dry needling for scar treatment,"OBJECTIVE: To review current scientific knowledge as to the efficacy of dry needling of scars on pain and other related symptoms and explore the possible physiological mechanisms of action. METHODS: A narrative review of scientific literature published in English. RESULTS: Two randomized controlled trials found that dry needling of scars (using the classic ""surrounding the dragon"" technique in one study and intradermal needling in a second study) was more effective than sham or control interventions with respect to scar appearance and pain. Two case reports have suggested that scar needling generates a rapid decrease in pain and improvement of mobility in scarred tissues. Another two case reports have reported positive effects of scar needling on the wound healing process. These findings are supported by an animal study examining the effect of needling on the wound healing process and the physiological mechanisms of action underlying the technique. CONCLUSION: There is preliminary evidence that the ""surrounding the dragon"" needling technique is a beneficial treatment for patients suffering from scar pain and other scar-related symptoms and can facilitate wound healing and make this process less painful. Further high-quality studies should be conducted to verify/quantify the efficacy of this method, to better understand the underlying mechanisms of action underlying the effects of scar needling and to establish an effective intervention protocol.",Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#6607,Complementary and alternative medicine in major depressive disorder: the American Psychiatric Association Task Force report,"OBJECTIVE: To review selected complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) treatments for major depressive disorder (MDD). PARTICIPANTS: Authors of this report were invited participants in the American Psychiatric Association's Task Force on Complementary and Alternative Medicine. EVIDENCE: The group reviewed the literature on individual CAM treatments for MDD, methodological considerations, and future directions for CAM in psychiatry. Individual CAM treatments were reviewed with regard to efficacy in MDD, as well as risks and benefits. Literature searches included MEDLINE and PsycINFO reviews and manual reference searches; electronic searches were limited to English-language publications from 1965 to January 2010 (but manual searches were not restricted by language). Treatments were selected for this review on the basis of (1) published randomized controlled trials in MDD and (2) widespread use with important clinical safety or public health significance relevant to psychiatric practice. An action plan is presented based on needs pertaining to CAM and psychiatry. CONSENSUS PROCESS: Consensus was reached by group conferences. Written iterations were drafted and sent out among group members prior to discussion, resolution of any differences of interpretation of evidence, and final approval. CONCLUSIONS: A review of randomized controlled trials for commonly used CAM treatments such as omega-3 fatty acids, St John's wort (Hypericum), folate, S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAMe), acupuncture, light therapy, exercise, and mindfulness psychotherapies revealed promising results. More rigorous and larger studies are recommended. Each CAM treatment must be evaluated separately in adequately powered controlled trials. At this time, several CAM treatments appear promising and deserve further study. The greatest risk of pursuing a CAM therapy is the possible delay of other well-established treatments. Clinical, research, and educational initiatives designed to focus on CAM in psychiatry are clearly warranted due to the widespread use of CAM therapies.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#6611,[Network meta-analysis on the effects of the acupuncture-related therapy on ovulation rate and pregnancy rate in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome],"OBJECTIVE: To review systematically the safety and effectiveness of acupuncture-related therapies on ovulation rate and pregnancy rate in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).

In addition, both groups received amlodipine (5 mg) once daily, continuously for eight weeks. Systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP) and mean arterial BP (mABP) were recorded. Data were analyzed by Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS: SBP of the 40 cases in the acupuncture group significantly improved compared to the medication only group [Z =－ 4.265, P (2-tailed) = 0.001] and DBP of acupuncture group was lower than that of the control group (Z =－ 2.813, P = 0.005). mABP of acupuncture group was the marked improvement in the reduction of blood pressure to that of medication group in controlling blood pressure. (Z = －2.416, P = 0.016). CONCLUSION: These results indicate that the effectiveness of acupuncture with the acupuncture group is superior to the only medication group in the control of hypertension.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes
#6827,[Analysis of the Characteristics of Acupoint Selection in the Treatment of Gout by Acupuncture],"OBJECTIVE: To summarize and analyze the compatibility laws and the characteristics of acupoint selection in the treatment of gout by acupuncture over the past 16 years. METHODS: ""Gout"" and ""acupuncture"" or ""electroacupuncture"" were used as search terms in the CNKI, VIP, Wanfang and PubMed databases to retrieve relevant literature. The frequency of the main acupoints and auxiliary acupoints were summarized, respectively. Association rule and hierarchical clustering analysis were used to analyze the possible rules for selecting the main acupoints. RESULTS: One hundred and eighteen studies met the inclusiven criteria, and involved 67 main acupoints with a frequency of all points of 630. The most commonly used acupoints were Sanyinjiao (SP 6), Ashi point, Zusanli (ST 36), Yinlingquan (SP 9), and Taichong (LR 3). The main acupoints mainly belonged to the Spleen Meridian of Foot-taiyin, Stomach Meridian of Foot-yangming and Liver Meridian of Foot-jueyin. Association rule analysis showed that Ashi point, Zusanli (ST 36) and Sanyinjiao (SP 6) had the highest correlation of all the selected acupoints. The cluster analysis showed five core clustering groups. CONCLUSIONS: Acupuncture treatment of gout focuses on acupoints along meridians and the acupoints around the affected joint. The main principles in the treatment of gout are invigorating Spleen, tonifying Kidney, dissipating dampness, resolving blood stasis, clearing away heat, removing toxic substances, soothing Liver, regulating qi, dredging collaterals and relieving pain.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#6833,"Role of Acupuncture in the Treatment or Prevention of Migraine, Tension-Type Headache, or Chronic Headache Disorders","OBJECTIVE: To summarize the current evidence that evaluates the effectiveness of acupuncture for the treatment or prevention of migraine, tension-type headache, and chronic headache disorders. METHODS: Findings from selected systematic reviews and meta-analyses are summarized. RESULTS: Recently published systematic reviews and meta-analyses demonstrate that acupuncture is associated with improved clinical outcomes compared to routine care only, medical management, and sham acupuncture 2 months after randomization. The evidence in support of acupuncture's comparative effectiveness at longer follow-up periods is mixed. Cost effectiveness analyses conducted in the United Kingdom and Germany suggest that acupuncture is a cost-effective treatment option in those countries. There are few or no cost-effectiveness studies of acupuncture in the United States. DISCUSSION: This brief review of the current, published evidence does not include a discussion of potential risks or adverse events associated with acupuncture. There is also the question of the extent to which placebo effects might contribute to acupuncture's clinical effectiveness. From a purely comparative effectiveness perspective, however, the evidence from clinical trials and meta-analyses makes a compelling case in support of a potentially important role for acupuncture as part of a treatment plan for patients with migraine, tension-type headache, and several different types of chronic headache disorders.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#6855,[Effect and safety of electroacupuncture in the treatment of chronic prostatitis / chronic pelvic pain syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis of 17 randomized controlled trials],"OBJECTIVE: To systematically evaluate the effect and safety of electroacupuncture in the treatment of chronic prostatitis / chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS). METHODS: We searched the major Chinese and English databases of CNKI, Wanfang Data, VIP, CBM, PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science and Embase for randomized controlled trials (RCT) on electroacupuncture or combination therapy in the treatment of CP/CPPS published from the establishment of the databases to August 2024. The dichotomous data and continuous data were represented by risk ratio (RR) and mean difference (MD) respectively, both with 95% confidence interval (CI). We analyzed the data with the Revman (v.5.4) software and assessed the quality of the evidence in each RCT using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation system (GRADE). RESULTS: Totally 17 RCTs were identified, involving 1 404 cases of CP/CPPS treated by electroacupuncture or combination of electroacupuncture with medication or with other therapies (the trial group) or by medication with Western or Chinese drugs alone (the control group). Compared with the control group, the trial group showed a significantly higher rate of clinical effectiveness (RR = 1.25; 95% CI: 1.18－1.32; P < 0.05), decreased CPSI scores (MD =－4.56; 95% CI:－5.01－－4.11; P < 0.05), improved CPSI-pain, -urination and -quality of life scores, and increased maximum and average urinary flow rates. And electroacupuncture did not increase the likelihood of adverse reactions. CONCLUSION: Medium-quality evidence suggests that electroacupuncture is beneficial complementary and alternative therapy for CP/CPPS, with a significant advantage in improving the NIH-CPSI scores of the patients. However, more high-quality multi-centered RCTs with larger sample sizes are still needed to further verify the effect of electroacupuncture on CP/CPPS.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#6873,[Thrombolysis combined with acupuncture therapy for acute cerebral infarction: a Meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials],"OBJECTIVE: To systematically evaluate the efficacy and safety of thrombolysis combined with acupuncture therapy in the treatment of acute cerebral infarction (ACI) in the light of evidence-based medicine. METHODS: Randomized controlled trials (RCT) for acupuncture and thrombolysis treatment of acute cerebral infarction published from the inception of databa-ses to March 2020 were searched from PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, Web of science, CNKI, Wanfang, VIP, and CBM Database. According to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, two reviewers independently screened the RCTs and extracted the data. The quality of the included literature was evaluated, and the Meta-analysis was performed by using Revman 5.3 software. RESULTS: A total of 330 studies were identified, and 14 RCTs (including 604 cases of the treatment group, 598 cases of the control group) met the inclusion criteria. The Meta-analysis showed that the thrombolysis combined with acupuncture therapy was better than acupuncture therapy alone in the clinical effective rate (risk ratio ［RR］=1.19, 95% confidence interval ［CI］ ［1.13, 1.25］), NIHSS score (mean difference ［MD］=-3.51, 95% CI ［-4.54, -2.48］), BI index (MD=12.26, 95% CI ［8.07, 16.46］), and in lowering C-reaction protein levels (MD=-3.99, 95% CI ［-4.35, -3.63］).

#6877,Effect of electrical stimulation in the treatment on patients with foot drop after stroke: a systematic review and network meta-analysis,"OBJECTIVE: To systematically evaluate the efficacy of electrical stimulation (ES) in the treatment of patients with foot drop (FD) after stroke, and to compare the efficacy of different types of ES. DATA SOURCES: We searched 5 English database (PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane Library and Scopus) and 4 Chinese databases (China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), SinoMed (CBM), VIP and Wanfang Data) from inception to June, 2024. DATA SYNTHESIS: Traditional meta-analysis and network meta-analysis were performed using RevMan5.4 software and Stata 14.0 software respectively. A total of 37 RCTs were included, involving 2309 patients. The results of the traditional meta-analysis showed that compared with CRT, ES combined with CRT was effective in improving the range of motion (ROM) of ankle dorsiflexion in patients with FD after stroke and significantly improved the fugl-meyer assessment of lower extremity (FMA-LE) scores. For patients with FD with different disease duration, the subgroup analysis results showed that the ES improved the ROM of ankle dorsiflexion of patients in recovery phases (1-6 months) better than those in the acute phases (≤ 1 month) and sequelae phases (≥ 6 months), but the overall results of the three groups were not significantly different. The ES improved the lower limb motor function of patients in the recovery phases better than those in the acute phases, and the efficacy was not significant in patients in the sequelae phases (P > 0.05). The results of network meta-analysis showed that the best probability of improving the dorsiflexion angle of the ankle was electroacupuncture (EA) > transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) > transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) > functional electrical stimulation (FES) > neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) > electromyographic biofeedback therapy (EMGBFT) > conventional rehabilitation therapy (CRT); the best probability of improving the dorsiflexion angle of the ankle was EA > EMGBFT > tDCS > FES > TENS > NMES > CRT. CONCLUSIONS: The current evidence showed that the ES combined with CRT can effectively improve the ROM of ankle dorsiflexion and lower limb motor function in patients with FD after stroke, especially the patients in recovery phases. Among the different types of ES, EA had the best effect than other types of ES.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#6885,Overview of the relevant literature on the possible role of acupuncture in treating male sexual dysfunction,"OBJECTIVE: To systematically review scientific reports on the effectiveness of acupuncture to treat male sexual dysfunction. METHODS: The Medline database was searched for published clinical trials of acupuncture for erectile dysfunction (ED) and premature ejaculation (PE) with English abstracts. Risk of bias was assessed for randomised controlled trials (RCTs). RESULTS: Seven studies on two conditions of male sexual dysfunction met the inclusion criteria. Three out of four RCTs were patient-blinded, but all had a high risk of bias. Three suggested that acupuncture has a therapeutic effect as compared with sham acupuncture. Comparisons with paroxetine were inconsistent. Other uncontrolled studies and case series suggested satisfactory improvements of ED and PE after acupuncture. CONCLUSIONS: Acupuncture appears to have promise for treating male sexual dysfunction, but in view of the small number of studies and their variable quality, doubts remain about its effectiveness. Further studies are justified.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#6896,[Adverse events/adverse reactions of acupoint catgut embedding therapy for psoriasis vulgaris: a systematic review],"OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the occurrence of adverse events/adverse reactions (AEs/ARs) induced by acupoint catgut embedding therapy for psoriasis vulgaris (PV) and its safety. METHODS: Randomized controlled trials, controlled clinical trials, cohort studies, case-control studies, case-series, and case reports concerning the treatment of PV with acupoint catgut embedding therapy were searched from Chinese and English databases from their inception to January 7(th), 2021. The AEs/ARs related to acupoint catgut embedding therapy for PV were subjected to descriptive statistics, followed by the analysis of possible reasons. RESULTS: Finally, 16 studies were included, involving 1 158 patients. A total of 79 cases were reported to present with mild to moderate AEs/ARs related to acupoint catgut embedding therapy for PV, and there were no serious AEs/ARs or death cases. The most common AEs/ARs were local redness, swelling, heat, and pain (31.65%,25/79), followed by low-grade fever and fatigue (29.11%,23/79), isomorphic reaction (16.46%,13/79), local induration (13.92%,11/79), and fainting (8.86%,7/79). In terms of embedding materials, catgut (93.67%,74/79) and lumbar puncture needles or other puncture needles (49.37%,39/79) were proved the most common AEs/ARs-inducing factors. The proportion of AEs/ARs resulting from treatment interval≤two weeks (67.09%,53/79) and treatment course≤eight weeks (55.70%,44/79) was relatively high. Because the incidence of AEs/ARs fails to be calcula-ted, it is not yet possible to accurately assess the risk and safety of acupoint catgut embedding therapy for PV. CONCLUSION: Available evidence suggests that in the treatment of PV, acupoint catgut embedding therapy may induce a series of mild to moderate AEs/ARs, so its clinical practice deserves attention. We should strictly grasp its indications and contraindications, and prevent the occurrence of related AEs/ARs by standardizing the operation and improving the embedding materials.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No

#6915,CT evaluation of acupuncture needles inserted into sacral foramina,"OBJECTIVE: To use CT scanning to evaluate the precision with which acupuncture needles can be inserted into sacral foramina to establish sacral nerve modulation by electroacupuncture. METHODS: The subjects were five adult women (mean age 71.6 years). These five cases were divided into two groups. In the first three subjects (group A) the intention was to insert acupuncture needles in the S3 and S4 foramina; in the remaining two subjects (group B) the intention was to insert acupuncture needles in the S2 and S3 foramina. RESULTS: CT scanning showed that in subject 1 of group A, the acupuncture needle intended for insertion in S3 was actually in the S4 foramen, and the acupuncture needle intended for insertion in S4 was actually distal to the sacral body. In subjects 2 and 3, the acupuncture needles were inserted accurately in the S3 and S4 foramina. In the three subjects who had acupuncture needles inserted in the S4 foramen, the tip of the acupuncture needle was an average distance of 6.0 mm from the rectum. The acupuncture needles inserted in subjects 4 and 5 of group B were inserted accurately into the S2 and S3 foramina. CONCLUSIONS: Inserting acupuncture needles into the sacral foramina of S2 and S3 at an angle of about 60° has the potential to be used for sacral nerve modulation by repeated electroacupuncture stimulation. Needling may be less accurate in subjects with higher body mass index. Because of the potential risk of perforating the rectum with the needle, this technique must be used by specialists only.

#6993,The effects of decreasing maternal anxiety on fetal oxygenation and nucleated red blood cells count in the cord blood,"OBJECTIVE: Vasoconstriction during anxiety reduces fetal oxygenation and leads to hypoxia. Hypoxia in turn results in increase of the number of nucleated red blood cells (NRBCs) in the cord blood. The present study aimed to assess the effect of decreasing maternal anxiety on fetal oxygenation and NRBCs count in the cord blood. METHODS: . In this study, 150 women were randomly divided into two intervention groups [supportive care and acupressure in BL32 (bladder) acupoint] and a control group (hospital routine care). The infants' cord blood was investigated regarding the number of NRBCs and the intensity of hypoxia after birth. Then, the data were entered into the SPSS statistical software (v. 16) and analyzed using ANOVA, Chi-square test, and logistic regression analysis. Findings : The significant difference was found between the two groups regarding the number of NRBCs counted in the peripheral blood smear (P<0.001). Besides, a significant relationship was observed between the length of the first and second stages of labor and the number of NRBCs in the cord blood (P=0.01). Also, a significant association was observed between the type of delivery and the number of NRBCs in the cord blood in both intervention (P<0.001) and control groups (P=0.03). CONCLUSION: Doula supportive care and acupressure at BL32 point reduced the length of labor stages as well as the anxiety level. Also, nucleated red blood cells were less in the 2 groups of intervention than in control group. Regarding the fact that nucleated red blood cells cannot be the only factor for hypoxia predicting, for affirmation of this theory study with higher sample size and survey of mothers at high risk are needed.",No,No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No
#6995,The Impact of Inpatient Acupuncture on a Mixed Hospital Floor: A Pragmatic 3-Month Cost-Effectiveness Retrospective Evaluation,"OBJECTIVE: Viability of inpatient acupuncture is limited by current hospital reimbursement structuring. Research has primarily focused on length of stay (LOS) instead of cost of stay (COS). This study evaluated acupuncture as an option for inpatient pain control, determined if acupuncture influenced patient satisfaction during hospitalization, and examined any effects on LOS and COS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a quasiexperimental pilot research study, acupuncture was offered free of charge for 3 months on a single floor of an urban medical center. Pre- and postintervention scores, number of treatments, and diagnosis related groups (DRGs) of patients receiving acupuncture were tracked and then compared to a nonintervention, DRGs-matched group with overlapping hospital-floor and admission dates. LOS, COS, and patient satisfaction scores during the months of intervention were compared to the months before and after the intervention. RESULTS: Patients' pain significantly decreased each time they were treated. Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems scores increased to 85, 99, and 97 during the months of intervention and then returned to the lower, preacupuncture levels after acupuncture was no longer available. LOS was higher in the intervention group (+7.8 days), but acupuncture saved the hospital an anticipated $125,770 in the projected COS during that 3-month time alone. CONCLUSIONS: Acupuncture was a potent pain-relief alternative for hospitalized patients, providing more satisfaction. Acupuncture resulted in longer LOS, but the aggregate COS was 86% less than expected. Acupuncture may be a financially viable, clinically impactful adjunct to hospital care.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No

Attack frequency, a measure recommended by the International Headache Society as a primary outcome measure for migraine prophylaxis trials, correlated only moderately with other diary outcomes. At baseline the parameters measured in the headache diary correlated only weakly with the generic outcome measures. After 12 weeks these correlations had increased considerably. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that participants in headache trials ""learn"" to fill in diaries and generic instruments in a more consistent manner during the course of the study.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#7012,Acupuncture for lower back pain: a review,"OBJECTIVE: We briefly discuss the history of acupuncture and its postulated mechanisms of action, but our primary objective is to discuss the evidence for acupuncture's efficacy in low back pain as well as approaches of newer study protocols to define more clearly the true usefulness of this alternative modality in low back pain. METHODS: Pubmed online search of all articles and other literature in the past 50 years related to acupuncture efficacy in low back pain, including case reports, randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses. RESULTS: Lower back pain and its associated incapacitating sequelae constitute an important healthcare and socioeconomic problem. There have been multiple, generally poor quality studies on the efficacy of acupuncture for this multi-factorial pain condition. Although newer studies seem to show promise, effectiveness has not been clearly demonstrated. CONCLUSIONS: There is a paucity of high-quality research assessing efficacy of acupuncture in the management of LBP. Nonetheless, it continues to play a significant role in our clinical practice, not as a sole therapeutic modality but rather as an adjunct to a multidisciplinary integrative approach of LBP management. Most of the published articles about acupuncture in the biomedical literature consist of case reports, case series, or intervention studies with designs inadequate to assess its efficacy. Thus it is imperative that further research be performed, both preclinical to help elucidate the mechanisms underlying acupuncture, and clinical to justify its clinical application.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#7028,"A one year follow-up study on the effects of acupuncture in the treatment of stroke patients in the subacute stage: a randomized, controlled study","OBJECTIVE: We recently reported that acupuncture treatment of stroke patients in the subacute stage gave additive therapeutic benefit. The purpose of the present study was to determine, approximately one year after discharge from the rehabilitation hospital, whether the group differences still remained. DESIGN: The patients were randomized into two groups: one acupuncture group and one control group, considering gender and side of hemispheral localization of lesion. With regard to the main parameters the groups were comparable at baseline. SETTING: Initially, 45 stroke patients admitted to Sunnaas Rehabilitation Hospital were included in the study: median 40 days post stroke. SUBJECTS: Forty-one of the patients were available one year after the treatment period: 21 patients in the acupuncture group and 20 controls. INTERVENTION: All subjects received an individually adapted, multidisciplinary rehabilitation programme. The acupuncture group received additional treatment with classical acupuncture for 30 min three to four times weekly for six weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The patients were evaluated at inclusion, after six weeks and approximately 12 months after discharge from the rehabilitation hospital. The Motor Assessment Scale (MAS) for stroke patients, Sunnaas Index of Activity of Daily Living (ADL) and Nottingham Health Profile (NHP) were used. In addition, the social situations of the patients were recorded at one year follow-up. RESULTS: The results show that the acupuncture group improved significantly more than the controls, both during the treatment period of six weeks, and even more during the following year, both according to MAS, ADL, NHP and the social situation. CONCLUSION: Although the mechanism of the effects is debatable, there seems to be a positive long-term effect of acupuncture given in the subacute stage post stroke.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes
#7029,Successful treatment of central pain in a multiple sclerosis patient with epidural stimulation of the dorsal root entry zone,"OBJECTIVE: We report a case of central pain successfully treated by epidural placement of spinal cord stimulator electrodes. Neuromodulation of primary afferent fibers and the underlying dorsal root entry zone provided effective analgesia whereas traditional lead placement over the dorsal columns on a prior occasion had not been effective. The rationale for this technique based on current understanding of the mechanisms of central pain and the risk/benefit considerations are discussed. CASE REPORT: A 52-year-old woman presented with a 2-year history of pain in the lateral hand secondary to a demyelinating episode in the C2-4 spinal cord secondary to multiple sclerosis. Medications, sympathetic blocks, and acupuncture had been ineffective. One year after an unsuccessful single-lead trial of spinal cord stimulation over the cervical dorsal columns, a dual-lead trial of spinal cord stimulation over the lateral cervical spinal cord and dorsal roots provided significant analgesia, prompting a successful permanent implant. OUTCOME MEASURES: Responses on the Brief Pain Inventory short form and quantitative thermosensory testing data were collected at two timepoints 16 days apart under two conditions: no stimulation and single-lead stimulation of cervical primary afferents and underlying spinal cord. RESULTS: The patient's questionnaire responses indicated significantly improved pain scores with lateral-lead neuromodulation that was associated with a reduction in her baseline heat hypoalgesia. CONCLUSIONS: Lateral-lead spinal cord stimulation may be effective for some central pain syndromes through a partial restoration of homeostatic small-fiber signaling. Neuroanatomical and physiological data in a larger population of patients will be required to predict the best responders to this therapeutic modality.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#7035,Three-needle of regulating the mind combined with umbilical needle intervention for cervical vertigo with deficiency of qi and blood-A study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,"OBJECTIVE: With a higher incidence rate among the younger population, cervical vertigo (CV) can impose a significant burden on patients with CV. It is believed that a deficiency of qi and blood is the primary pathogenesis in Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Acupuncture is a vital strategy for CV, but the efficacy of current acupuncture therapies remains unsatisfactory. Thus, this randomized controlled study will assess the safety and effectiveness of three-needle of regulating the mind combined with umbilical needle (TNRM-UN) therapy for CV with qi and blood deficiency. METHODS: This was a single-center, assessor-, and analyst-blinded, prospective randomized controlled trial that involved treatment for 6 weeks and follow-up for 24 weeks. Ninety-nine patients with CV deficiency of qi and blood are randomly allocated to three groups in a 1:1:1 ratio. The patients in the observation group will receive three-needle of regulating the mind combined with umbilical needle (TNRM-UN) therapy. In contrast, the patients in the control-1 group will receive three-needle of regulating the mind combined with traditional acupuncture (TNRM-TA), and the patients in the control-2 group will receive only umbilical needle (UN) therapy. Primary outcomes include Cervical Vertigo Symptom and Functional Assessment Scale (CVS-FAS) score and qi and Blood Deficiency Symptoms Assessment Scale (QBD-SAS) score. The secondary outcomes are hemodynamic changes in the bilateral vertebral arteries, including diameter value (DV), peak systolic velocity (PSV), end-diastolic velocity (EDV), pulsatility index (PI), and resistance index (RI). All outcome measurements will be evaluated before and after 6 weeks of treatment. Primary outcomes will be evaluated at 12 and 24 weeks of follow-up. Adverse events (AEs) were evaluated during treatment and follow-up periods. RESULTS: This study aimed to determine whether TNRM-UN is more effective than current acupuncture therapies by providing compelling evidence and deciding whether TNRM-UN can be used as a promising therapy for CV with a deficiency of qi and blood.

#7037,Network meta-analysis of 7 acupuncture therapies for knee osteoarthritis,"OBJECTIVE: With the progression of society aging demographic, the prevalence of knee osteoarthritis (KOA) continues to rise steadily, exerting a significant impact on individuals' quality of life. Acupuncture therapy has garnered extensive utilization in the management of osteoarthritis; however, a comprehensive systematic review integrating acupuncture with traditional Chinese medicine remains absent. This study compared the clinical efficacy of 7 acupuncture methods (electroacupuncture, conventional acupuncture, warm needle, floating needle, fire needle, needle knife, and silver needle) for the treatment of KOA through a network meta-analysis. METHODS: This study examined the databases-PubMed, EMbase, The Cochrane Library, the China Biology Medicine, Chinese Journal Full-text Database, Wanfang Database, and VIP Database-for randomized controlled trials of the 7 methods for KOA treatment. The search time spanned from the database establishment to March 5, 2022. The primary outcome indicator was the total effective rate, and the secondary outcome indicator was the visual analog scale. After the layer-by-layer screening, the quality of the literature was assessed using the Cochrane systematic reviewer manual 5.1.0 bias risk assessment tool for randomized controlled trials. After data extraction, the R4.0.1 software was used for network meta-analysis. RESULTS: Based on the network meta-analysis, the ranking of interventions based on the surface under the cumulative ranking curve for the total effective rate is as follows: silver needle (0.99) > floating needle (0.97) > needle knife (0.66) > fire needle (0.56) > warm needle (0.44) > conventional acupuncture (0.35) > electroacupuncture (0.13). Regarding the improvement in visual analog scale scores, the surface under the cumulative ranking curve ranking is as follows: silver needle (0.97) > conventional acupuncture (0.67) > needle knife (0.64) > floating needle (0.51) > warm needle (0.44) > fire needle (0.14) > electroacupuncture (0.09). CONCLUSION: Based on the network meta-analysis, silver needle therapy emerged as the most efficacious and analgesic intervention for KOA. Nevertheless, given the notable variations in the quality and quantity of studies encompassing diverse treatment modalities, the findings of this research necessitate further substantiation through forthcoming high-quality multicenter, large-sample, randomized double-blind trials.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#7046,Effect of Acupuncture at HT-7 (Shenmen) and GV-20 (Baihui) on Anxiety and Cardiovascular Functions in Generalized Anxiety Disorder: A Randomized Controlled Trial,"ObjectiveGeneralized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a condition that can cause persistent and excessive worry, leading to physical and emotional symptoms. Acupuncture, a traditional Chinese medicine practice, has been studied as a potential treatment for anxiety disorders, including GAD. Though acupuncture at HT-7 and GV-20 along with other acupuncture points reduce anxiety level, no study to our knowledge has examined the effect of acupuncture at HT-7 and GV-20 alone in GAD. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the effect of needling at HT-7 (Shenmen) and GV-20 (Baihui) acupuncture points on anxiety levels and cardiovascular function in patients with GAD.MethodsA total of 60 participants ages 20-55 diagnosed with GAD were randomly assigned to either a study group or a control group. The study group received acupuncture at the HT-7 and GV-20 points, while the control group underwent breath awareness meditation in supine position. Both groups underwent 20 min of the practice daily for 10 days. Assessments such as Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) score, blood pressure (BP) and pulse rate (PR) were performed before and after the intervention.ResultsParticipants in the study group had a significant reduction in anxiety levels (P < .001) compared to the control group. No significant inter-group differences were observed in systolic BP (P = .686), diastolic BP (P = .998), or PR (P = .925).ConclusionThe present study suggests that needling at HT-7 and GV-20 acupuncture points (20 min/session for 10 days) reduces anxiety levels without affecting cardiovascular function in younger and middle-aged patients with GAD.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes
#7047,[Controlled study of ultrasound-guided acupotomy on spinal and articular diseases],"OBJECTIVEL to study the visualization of acupotomy therapy and to summarize differences of interventional ultrasound combined with acupotomy on spinal and articular diseases. METHODS: With randomized block design, 20 cases of shoulder periarthritis, 20 cases of knee arthritis, 20 cases of lumbar disc herniation and 20 cases of cervical disc herniation were divided into an ultrasound-guided group and regular group, 10 cases of each diseas in each group. The ultrasound-guided acupotomy and regular acupotomy were given for one time, respectively. Efficacy was observed after one week. Visual analogue scale (VAS) and fuction score were applied for efficacy assessment, including Wang's funtion evaluation table for cervical disc herniation, modified lumbago assessment by Japanese Orthopaedic Association for lumbar disc herniation, modified lumbago assessment arthritis and CMC shoulder funtion scale for shoulder periarthritis. The changes of scores of patients in two groups were observed before and after the treatment. RESULTS: Each disease in each group achieved favorable efficacy; compared before and after treatment, differences of VAS and each function score all were statistically significant (allP<0.01). The efficacy of lumbar disc herniation and cerical disc herniation in two groups was not obviously different (both P>0.01). The efficacy of lumbar disc herniation and cervical disc herniation in two groups was not obviously different (bothP>0.05), while VAS and fuction scores improvements of shoulder periarthritis and knee +/-5.75 vs 75.72+/-8.56; knee arthritis: 90.40+/-7.35 vs 75.54+/-9.21, both P<0.05).

#7050,Acupuncture for Chronic Pain-Related Insomnia: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Objectives. Acupuncture has been widely used to relieve chronic pain-related insomnia (CPRI). However, the efficacy of acupuncture for CPRI is uncertain. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of acupuncture for CPRI. Methods. Seven electronic databases were searched from inception to December 2018. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included if acupuncture was compared to sham acupuncture or conventional drug therapies for treating CPRI. Two reviewers screened each study and extracted data independently. Statistical analyses were conducted by RevMan 5.3 software. Results. A total of nine studies involving 944 patients were enrolled. The pooled analysis indicated that acupuncture treatment was significantly better than control group in improving effective rate (OR = 8.09, 95%CI = [4.75, 13.79], P < 0.00001) and cure rate (OR = 3.17, 95%CI = [2.35, 4.29], P < 0.00001), but subgroup analysis showed that there was no statistically significant difference between acupuncture and sham acupuncture in improving cure rate (OR =10.36, 95% CI [0.53, 201.45], P=0.12) based on one included study. In addition, meta-analysis demonstrated that acupuncture group was superior to control group in debasing PSQI score (MD = -2.65, 95%CI = [-4.00, -1.30], P = 0.0001) and VAS score (MD = -1.44, 95%CI = [-1.58, -1.29], P < 0.00001). And there was no significant difference in adverse events (OR =1.73, 95%CI = [0.92, 3.25], P =0.09) between the two groups. Conclusions. Acupuncture therapy is an effective and safe treatment for CPRI, and this treatment can be recommended for the management of patients with CPRI. Due to the low quality and small sample size of the included studies, more rigorously designed RCTs with high quality and large sample size are recommended in future.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#7063,The Efficacy and Safety of Acupuncture for the Treatment of Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Objectives. We aimed to summarize and critically evaluate the available evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of acupuncture for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Methods. We searched 13 databases for studies published up to December 2016. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the efficacy of acupuncture for children with ASD were included. Outcome measures were the overall scores on scales evaluating the core symptoms of ASD and the scores for each symptom, such as social communication ability and skills, stereotypies, language ability, and cognitive function. Effect sizes were presented as mean differences (MD). Results. Twenty-seven RCTs with 1736 participants were included. Acupuncture complementary to behavioral and educational intervention significantly decreased the overall scores on the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) (MD -8.10, 95% CI -12.80 to -3.40) and the Autism Behavior Checklist (MD -8.92, 95% CI -11.29 to -6.54); however, it was unclear which of the ASD symptoms improved. Acupuncture as a monotherapy also reduced the overall CARS score. The reported adverse events were acceptable. Conclusions. This review suggests that acupuncture may be effective and safe for pediatric ASD. However, it is not conclusive due to the heterogeneity of the acupuncture treatment methods used in the studies.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#7068,The effect of acupuncture on postoperative nausea and vomiting after pediatric tonsillectomy: A meta-analysis and systematic review,"OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Tonsillectomy is one of the most frequently performed pediatric surgical procedures worldwide. The complications of this procedure include postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) and pain; therefore, both the treatment and prevention of PONV are important. Classical antiemetics include drug therapies such as ondansetron, which are undesirable because they often carry a high cost and several side effects. Therefore, in this study we aimed to evaluate the antiemetic effect of acupuncture after pediatric tonsillectomy. METHODS: We searched for eligible articles that reported on the antiemetic effects of acupuncture after tonsillectomy using the three databases, MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane, through July 2015. We included full-length original articles with adequate data for evaluating the antiemetic effects on pediatric tonsillectomy in the form of a relative ratio. The Newcastle-Ottawa scale was used to assess the quality of case control and cohort studies, and the Cochrane risk of bias tool was employed for randomized controlled trials (RCTs). RESULTS: The search identified 415 publications. After screening, we selected eight articles for review (4 RCTs, 3 prospective cohorts, and 1 pilot study). A meta-analysis of acupuncture in pediatric tonsillectomy revealed that the number of patients with PONV was significantly reduced with acupuncture compared to the control group, with a risk ratio of 0.77 (95% confidence interval: 0.63-0.94, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: When acupuncture at PC6 (neiguan) was used to prevent PONV after pediatric tonsillectomy, the risk ratio was significantly lower compared to that of conventional drug therapy. Although further randomized controlled trials are needed, acupuncture at PC6 is considered an economic and effective treatment for emesis after pediatric tonsillectomy.

#7083,Selecting acupuncture treatment for hot flashes: a Delphi consensus compared with a clinical trial,"OBJECTIVES: A treatment protocol was required for a trial of traditional Chinese acupuncture for menopausal hot flashes (ACUFLASH). A study that aimed to generate a consensus of the opinions of expert practitioners was set up, though the trial commenced before the process had been completed. This article reports on the consensus process, and compares the syndromes and treatments generated by expert consensus with those actually used in the clinical trial. DESIGN: A panel of 10 experts was included in an e-mail Delphi process. The experts were asked to suggest the syndromes they would expect to be diagnosed most frequently in women with menopausal hot flashes. They were asked to list the symptoms they would use to diagnose the individual syndromes, and the points they would use to treat them. RESULTS: After six rounds of the Delphi process, consensus was achieved on eight syndromes, and on about five indicative symptoms for each syndrome, and five to eight acupuncture points for treatment. The clinicians in the ACUFLASH trial used five syndromes, four of which matched the consensus. The points used by the two groups overlapped by 28%. CONCLUSIONS: Eight (8) of 10 international acupuncture experts were able to reach consensus on the syndromes, symptoms, and treatment of postmenopausal women with hot flashes. The syndromes were similar to those used by practitioners in the ACUFLASH clinical trial, but there were considerable differences between the acupuncture points. This difference is likely to be the result of differences in approach of training schools, and whether it is relevant for clinical outcomes is not well understood.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#7100,Acupuncture for acute postoperative pain after back surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials,"OBJECTIVES: Acupuncture is commonly used as a complimentary treatment for pain management. However, there has been no systematic review summarizing the current evidence concerning the effectiveness of acupuncture for acute postoperative pain after back surgery. This systematic review aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of acupuncture treatment for acute postoperative pain (≤1 week) after back surgery. METHODS: We searched 15 electronic databases without language restrictions. Two reviewers independently assessed studies for eligibility and extracted data, outcomes, and risk of bias. Random effect meta-analyses and subgroup analyses were performed. RESULTS: Five trials, including 3 of high quality, met our inclusion criteria. The meta-analysis showed positive results for acupuncture treatment of pain after surgery in terms of the visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain intensity 24 hours after surgery, when compared to sham acupuncture (standard mean difference -0.67 (-1.04 to -0.31), P = 0.0003), whereas the other meta-analysis did not show a positive effect of acupuncture on 24-hour opiate demands when compared to sham acupuncture (standard mean difference -0.23 (-0.58 to 0.13), P = 0.21). CONCLUSION: Our systematic review finds encouraging but limited evidence for the effectiveness of acupuncture treatment for acute postoperative pain after back surgery. Further rigorously designed clinical trials are required.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#7114,Characteristics of traditional Chinese medicine use for children with allergic rhinitis: a nationwide population-based study,"OBJECTIVES: Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a common allergic disorder in children, some of whom seek complementary treatments, including acupuncture and Chinese herbs. Little, however, is known about the treatment of pediatric AR with traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). To characterize TCM use in pediatric AR, we conducted a nationwide population-based study. METHODS: We screened one million randomly sampled beneficiaries of the National Health Insurance Program in Taiwan from 2002 to 2010 to identify children <18 years of age with newly diagnosed allergic rhinitis (ICD-9 code 477.9). The subjects were categorized according to their use of TCM. RESULTS: We identified 97,401 children newly diagnosed with AR for inclusion in the study. Among these children, 63.11% (N=61,472) had used TCM. There were significantly more TCM users than non-users among school-age children and adolescents (P<0.001). Most (99.1%) pediatric TCM users received Chinese herbal remedies (99.1%); only 0.9% received acupuncture or manipulative therapies. Xin-Yi-Qing-Fei-Tang (Magnolia Flower Lung-Clearing Decoction) was the most frequently prescribed TCM formulation (23.44%), and the most commonly prescribed single herb was Chan-Tui (Periostracum cicadae; 13.78%). Regarding syndrome differentiation (ZHENG) according to TCM theory, prescriptions for the Cold Syndrome exceeded those for the Hot Syndrome throughout the year in Taiwan. CONCLUSIONS: We found that approximately two-thirds of pediatric AR patients were prescribed TCM treatments in Taiwan. Further research is warranted to examine the efficacy and safety of TCM for pediatric AR patients.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#7123,In Vitro Assays for the Assessment of Safety and Toxicity in Pharmacopuncture Derived from Animal,"OBJECTIVES: Among the various treatment methods involving the use of natural substances, pharmacopuncture using animal venom is a relatively new form of acupuncture that has been developed in South Korea and is gaining popularity worldwide. Pharmacopuncture with animal venom is widely used in clinical practice; therefore, ensuring its procedural safety is crucial. This study aimed to evaluate the safety and toxicity of pharmacopuncture using animal venom. METHODS: In October 2021, nine samples of animal venom-derived pharmacopuncture products were randomly collected from four External Herbal Dispensaries (EHDs). These samples underwent sterility and microbial limit testing to ensure they were free from microbial contamination. Toxicity tests were conducted using three different cell lines to evaluate cytotoxic effects. RESULTS: The sterility and microbial limit tests showed no microbial growth in any of the pharmacopuncture samples. However, the toxicity tests revealed that bee venom exhibited strong cytotoxicity. Furthermore, samples containing Bovis Calculus, Fel Ursi, and Moschus also demonstrated varying degrees of cytotoxic effects. CONCLUSION: This study is the first to analyze the safety and toxicity of animal venom-derived pharmacopuncture products, providing evidence for its procedural safety. Although the samples analyzed were limited to four EHDs, these findings highlight the importance of further research on the safety and toxicity of pharmacopuncture to ensure its clinical application is both effective and safe.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#7162,Discrimination in health care and CAM use in a representative sample of U.S. adults,"OBJECTIVES: Discrimination in medical settings may influence patient attitudes about health care and health-seeking behaviors. Patients who experience discrimination may seek alternative means of health care, including use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between discrimination in health care and CAM use. DESIGN: Data come from the 2001 Health Care Quality Survey (HCQS), which used a multistage sampling design with random-digit dialing, oversampling telephone exchanges with higher densities of African-American, Hispanic, and Asian households. The 2001 HCQS sample consisted of 6722 adults living in the continental United States. To correct for the disproportionate sample design, data were adjusted using sample weights to make the results representative of the U.S. population 18 years and older. Present analyses were limited to 6008 respondents who had visited a doctor or clinic or had been admitted to the hospital in the last 2 years. OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcome measures were CAM use, practitioner-provided CAM use, and herbal medicine use. RESULTS: In adjusted logistic regression analyses, discrimination in health care was significantly associated with use of herbal medicines alone (adjusted odds ratio=1.47, confidence interval: 1.05, 2.04), but not with use of practitioner-provided CAM (i.e., use of acupuncture, chiropractor, traditional healer or herbalist, alone or in combination with herbal medicines).

#7206,Acupuncture for lumbar spinal stenosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"OBJECTIVES: Lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) negatively affects patients' quality of life. No systematic review evaluating the effects and safety of acupuncture for this population is available. We aimed to evaluate evidence indicating the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture for LSS. METHODS: We searched five English-language databases (EMBASE, MEDLINE, CENTRAL, CINAHL, and AMED) and one Chinese database (CAJ) for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomised controlled clinical trials (CCTs) of needle acupuncture for LSS. CCTs were analyzed only in terms of safety and intervention-related information. RESULTS: Six RCTs (n=582) and six CCTs, which were all from China and reported in Chinese, were included. High or uncertain risk of bias and clinical heterogeneity due to different acupuncture techniques were observed. All RCTs compared different combinations or techniques of acupuncture. None of the included studies mentioned safety issues. Acupuncture combined with other interventions and/or with additional stimulation increased the number of improved patients compared with acupuncture alone or relatively simpler stimulation (n=582; relative risk, 1.16; 95% confidence interval 1.08-1.25). Pain intensity, overall symptoms, and functional outcomes related to LSS and quality of life showed significantly favourable improvement in the treatment group compared with the control group, which lasted for up to 6 months post-treatment. CONCLUSIONS: We found no conclusive evidence of the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture for LSS because of high or uncertain risk of bias and the limited generalisability of the included studies. Future trials using rigorous methodology, appropriate comparisons and clinically relevant outcomes should be conducted.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#7228,Bee Venom Acupuncture for Shoulder Pain: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials,"OBJECTIVES: Our review aimed to summarize and evaluate evidence on the effectiveness of bee venom acupuncture (BVA) in the treatment of shoulder pain. METHODS: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effectiveness of BVA on shoulder pain were searched up to October 2019 in 11 electronic databases (Medline, Embase, CENTRAL, CiNii, CNKI, VIP, Wanfang, Kmbase, NDSL, RISS, OASIS). The methodological quality of the included RCTs were evaluated using Cochrane Risk of Bias tool and a meta-analysis was performed. RESULTS: Seven studies were included in the review, and four studies were included in the meta-analysis. Comparing BVA plus conventional therapy (CT) with saline injection plus CT, it showed an effect in favor of BVA plus CT in visual analog scale (VAS) and pain rating scale (PRS) (p = 0.02, p = 0.009, respectively). Comparing BVA plus physiotherapy (PT) with saline injection plus PT, it showed that there was no significant difference in VAS and verbal rating scale (VRS) between the two groups.

#7232,Are Nonpharmacologic Pain Interventions Effective at Reducing Pain in Adult Patients Visiting the Emergency Department? A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,"OBJECTIVES: Pain is a common complaint in the emergency department (ED). Its management currently depends heavily on pharmacologic treatment, but evidence suggests that nonpharmacologic interventions may be beneficial. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess whether nonpharmacologic interventions in the ED are effective in reducing pain. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of the literature on all types of nonpharmacologic interventions in the ED with pain reduction as an outcome. We performed a qualitative summary of all studies meeting inclusion criteria and meta-analysis of randomized controlled studies measuring postintervention changes in pain. Interventions were divided by type into five categories for more focused subanalyses. RESULTS: Fifty-six studies met inclusion criteria for summary analysis. The most studied interventions were acupuncture (10 studies) and physical therapy (six studies). The type of pain most studied was musculoskeletal pain (34 studies). Most (42 studies) reported at least one improved outcome after intervention. Of these, 23 studies reported significantly reduced pain compared to control, 24 studies showed no difference, and nine studies had no control group. Meta-analysis included 22 qualifying randomized controlled trials and had a global standardized mean difference of -0.46 (95% confidence interval = -0.66 to -0.27) in favor of nonpharmacologic interventions for reducing pain. CONCLUSION: Nonpharmacologic interventions are often effective in reducing pain in the ED. However, most existing studies are small, warranting further investigation into their use for optimizing ED pain management.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#7242,Acupuncture in Postdate Pregnancy Management,"OBJECTIVES: Pharmacological labor induction is obtained through prostaglandins application and/or oxytocin infusion; however, the use seems to be related to fetal and maternal side effects. Traditional Chinese Medicine advocates the use of acupuncture to soften the cervix and induce uterine contractions. at which presented for The primary outcome was the rate of women admitted for labour induction in case of prolonged pregnancy at 41 + 5 weeks, and the secondary outcome was the rate of induction planning for other indications. METHODS: After obtaining informed consent, 375 undelivered women after 40 + 2 gestational age were enrolled for the study: 112 women received acupuncture and 263, routine care. Acupuncture was applied every odd day starting from 40 + 2 weeks up to 41 + 4 weeks. Women allocated to the control group received standard care. At 41 + 5 weeks, a pharmacological induction was planned. RESULTS: The rate of labor induction significantly differed between acupuncture and observation groups (19.6% vs. 38%; p < 0.01); in particular, women receiving acupuncture showed a lower rate of induction, indicating prolonged pregnancy (5.3% vs. 10.1%; p < 0.01). As far as the pharmacological device is concerned, no differences were observed with regard to the prostaglandins use, whereas oxytocin infusion rate was lower in the acupuncture group than in the observation group. CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggested that acupuncture applied at term of pregnancy seems to be effective in reducing the rate of labor induction which is performed for prolonged pregnancy at 41 + 5 weeks. Moreover, acupuncture also seems to be able to reduce oxytocin use; such a ""saving"" effect could play a role in childhood, considering that a recent study underlined the adverse effect of oxytocin on birth outcomes.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,Yes
#7243,Pharmacopuncture for Cervicogenic Dizziness,"OBJECTIVES: Pharmacopuncture is a treatment that medicinal fluid including herbal extract is injected in body under qi/flavor theory and meridian theories. There are a number of studies investigating the efficacy of pharmacopuncture for cervicogenic dizziness but its usage differs in each study. This study aimed to review previous studies of pharmacopuncture treatment for cervicogenic dizziness to navigate the direction of improvement. METHODS: Literature review was conducted on studies aimed at pharmacopuncture for cervicogenic dizziness. The randomized controlled studies which assessed the efficacy of pharmacopuncture on cervicogenic dizziness were selected. The studies were searched in Pubmed, RISS, OASIS and CNKI. After selecting eligible studies, the authors read the articles and summarized the points those are necessary in pharmacopuncture treatment for cervicogenic dizziness. RESULTS: Twenty seven studies and 2,709 participants were included. The diverse solutions were used and the most popular were Salvia miltiorrhiza, Angelica gigas, a compound in Gastrodia elata, Panax notoginseng saponins. Some studies investigated the efficacy of conventional medical compounds (lidocaine, vitamin B, dexamethasone) injected in acupoints. Adopting acupoints and combining with body acupuncture have shown the tendency to enhance the cure rate. Pharmacopuncture could improve the efficacy of conventional treatment for cervicogenic dizziness. CONCLUSION: As the solution and injection method varies, principles of pharmacopuncture for dizziness should be investigated.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#7244,Research Trends of Pharmacopuncture: a bibliometric analysis using VOSviewer (2007-2023),"OBJECTIVES: Pharmacopuncture is considered a unique new type of acupuncture in Korean medicine (KM). This study was performed to investigate the research trends regarding pharmacopuncture through a bibliometric analysis using VOSviewer. METHODS: The Web of Science Core Collection was searched for this study. The search terms were pharmacopuncture and pharmaco-puncture. The search was conducted on May 23, 2023, and 185 studies retrieved up to this date were included. Software VOSviewer version 1.6.19 was used to perform the bibliometric analysis. After data clearing, keyword co-occurrence and cooperation pattern analyses were performed. RESULTS: The number of studies on pharmacopuncture have gradually increased since the mid-2000s, with the most published in 2020 (46 studies). The quality of the studies has also steadily increased, and recently, several randomized controlled trials of pharmacopuncture have been conducted. Moreover, this treatment has been investigated in the context of KM clinical practice guideline development in Korea. The scope of pharmacopuncture studies to date seems to be limited to musculoskeletal pain and bee venom pharmacopuncture. The researchers from Jaseng Medical Foundation have been the core researchers in the field of pharmacopuncture in Korea. They collaborated with researchers from universities or government-funded research institutes. However, small-scale research teams from KM clinics and university researchers were also identified as independent clusters. CONCLUSION: Pharmacopuncture research has grown both quantitatively and qualitatively, but the scope needs to be further expanded. There is also a gap between the use of pharmacopuncture by KM doctors in clinical settings and pharmacopuncture research. Based on these findings, some suggestions for future studies in this field are discussed. Furthermore, these findings may be used as data to expand and globalize pharmacopuncture research in the future.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#7254,Traditional needle acupuncture treatment for insomnia: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials,"OBJECTIVES: Previous reviews regarding traditional needle acupuncture (TNA) treatment for insomnia were limited to English scientific literature. A comprehensive review including Chinese and English literature has therefore been conducted to examine the efficacy of TNA for insomnia. METHODS: We performed systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of TNA as intervention for insomnia against placebo, Western medication, and non-treated controls. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed by the modified Jadad score and the acupuncture procedure was appraised by the STRICTA criteria. RESULTS: Twenty RCTs were identified for detailed analysis. Majority of the RCTs concluded that TNA was significantly more effective than benzodiazepines for treating insomnia, with mean effective rates for acupuncture and benzodiazepines being 91% and 75%, respectively. In two more appropriately conducted trials, TNA appeared to be more efficacious in improving sleep than sleep hygiene counseling and sham acupuncture. Standardized and individualized acupuncture had similar effective rates. Despite these positive outcomes, there were methodological shortcomings in the studies reviewed, including imprecise diagnostic procedure, problems with randomization, blinding issues, and insufficient safety data. Hence, the superior efficacy of TNA over other treatments could not be ascertained. CONCLUSION: Since the majority of evidence regarding TNA for insomnia is based on studies with poor-quality research designs, the data, while somewhat promising, do not allow a clear conclusion on the benefits of TNA for insomnia. Moreover, the results support the need for large scale placebo-controlled double-blinded trials.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#7269,Comparing the effects of different non-pharmacological traditional Chinese medicine therapies on cancer survivors: A Bayesian Network Meta-analysis,"OBJECTIVES: Several studies have demonstrated the positive impact of non-pharmacological Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) therapies on pain, fatigue, sleep quality, and quality of life in cancer survivors. However, no research has compared the effectiveness of these therapies. This study aims to compare various interventions and identify the most effective non-pharmacological TCM therapies to provide evidence-based recommendations for cancer survivors. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, CNKI, and Wanfang Data. RCTs investigating the effects of Taichi, Qigong, acupuncture, acupressure, TCM emotional therapy, and mixed therapies as interventions for cancer survivors were screened was conducted. Data from the creation of the database to February 2025 were included. Two independent reviewers evaluated the study quality. A Bayesian Network Meta-analysis was conducted to carry out a random effects model. RESULTS: Seventy-one RCTs involving 6473 patients were included in the analysis. Network meta-analysis showed significance for all five intervention therapies in pain control in cancer patients. The best efficacy was observed for acupressure (SMD=-1.1 [-1.55, -0.66]) and Taichi/Qigong (SMD=-1.08[-1.64, -0.53]), followed by TCM emotional therapy (SMD=-0.93 [-1.42, -0.44]) and acupuncture (SMD=-0.54 [-0.93, -0.15]), with the latter showing comparatively lower efficacy. None of the interventions demonstrated superior efficacy in improving fatigue compared to the control group. Mixed therapies (SMD=-1.36[-2.56, -0.28]) demonstrated the greatest effect in improving sleep quality. Taichi/Qigong (SMD=1.87 [0.96, 2.83]) demonstrated certain advantages in improving quality of life. However, acupuncture and TCM emotional therapy had no significant effect on sleep quality or overall quality of life. CONCLUSION: The evidence from this study suggests that acupressure and Taichi/Qigong are recommended as the most effective therapies for pain relief and quality of life improvement, respectively. The efficacy of these therapies for fatigue remains inconclusive. However, due to the limited number of included studies and the high risk of bias, these results should be interpreted with caution. Future studies should include more rigorously designed high-quality randomized controlled trials to confirm their long-term efficacy and safety.

#7271,Prospective randomized trial using laser acupuncture versus desmopressin in the treatment of nocturnal enuresis,"OBJECTIVES: Several treatment modalities for children suffering from monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis are available, but desmopressin is a well-established option. On the other hand, alternative nonpharmacological therapies such as laser acupuncture are more frequently requested by the parents. To our knowledge, there is no prospective randomized trial which evaluated the efficacy of such an alternative approach in comparison with the widespread use of desmopressin. METHODS: Forty children aged over 5 years presenting with primary nocturnal enuresis underwent a previous evaluation of their voiding function to assure normal voiding patterns and a high nighttime urine production. Then the children were randomized into two groups: group A children were treated with desmopressin alone, and group B children underwent laser acupuncture. All children were investigated after a minimum follow-up period of 6 month to evaluate the duration of the response. RESULTS: The children of both groups had an initial mean frequency of 5.5 wet nights per week. After a minimum follow-up period of 6 months reevaluation revealed a complete success rate of 75% in the desmopressin-treated group. Additional 10% of the children had a reduction of their wet nights of more than 50%. On the other hand, 6 months after laser acupuncture, 65% of the randomized children were completely dry. Another 10% had a reduction of the enuresis frequency of more than 50% per week. 20% of the children in the desmopressin-treated group did not respond at all as compared with 15% in the acupuncture-treated group. Statistical evaluation revealed no significant differences among the response rates in both groups. CONCLUSION: Im comparison with pharmacological therapy using desmopressin, our study shows that laser acupuncture should be taken into account as an alternative, noninvasive, painless, cost-effective, and short-term therapy for children with primary nocturnal enuresis in case of a normal bladder function and high nighttime urine production. Success rates indicated no statistically significant differences between the well-established desmopressin therapy and the alternative laser acupuncture.",No,No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No
#7295,Cost-effectiveness of complementary therapies in the United kingdom-a systematic review,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this review is to systematically summarize and assess all prospective, controlled, cost-effectiveness studies of complementary therapies carried out in the UK. DATA SOURCES: Medline (via PubMed), Embase, CINAHL, Amed (Alternative and Allied Medicine Database, British Library Medical Information Centre), The Cochrane Library, National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database (via Cochrane) and Health Technology Assessments up to October 2005. REVIEW METHODS: Articles describing prospective, controlled, cost-effectiveness studies of any type of complementary therapy for any medical condition carried out in the UK were included. Data extracted included the main outcomes for health benefit and cost. These data were extracted independently by two authors, described narratively and also presented as a table. RESULTS: Six cost-effectiveness studies of complementary medicine in the UK were identified: four different types of spinal manipulation for back pain, one type of acupuncture for chronic headache and one type of acupuncture for chronic back pain. Four of the six studies compared the complementary therapy with usual conventional treatment in pragmatic, randomized clinical trials without sham or placebo arms. Main outcome measures of effectiveness favored the complementary therapies but in the case of spinal manipulation (four studies) and acupuncture (one study) for back pain, effect sizes were small and of uncertain clinical relevance. The same four studies included a cost-utility analyses in which the incremental cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) was less than pound10 000. The complementary therapy represented an additional health care cost in five of the six studies. CONCLUSIONS: Prospective, controlled, cost-effectiveness studies of complementary therapies have been carried out in the UK only for spinal manipulation (four studies) and acupuncture (two studies). The limited data available indicate that the use of these therapies usually represents an additional cost to conventional treatment. Estimates of the incremental cost of achieving improvements in quality of life compare favorably with other treatments approved for use in the National Health Service. Because the specific efficacy of the complementary therapies for these indications remains uncertain, and the studies did not include sham controls, the estimates obtained may represent the cost-effectiveness non-specific effects associated with the complementary therapies.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#7328,Chinese medicine treatment for menopausal symptoms in the UK health service: is a clinical trial warranted?,"OBJECTIVES: The aims of this pilot study were to evaluate treatment effects, ascertain safety and formulate best practice Chinese medicine protocols relevant for London women suffering from menopausal symptoms. STUDY DESIGN: This clinical pilot study employed a case series design within a wider action-based research project. 117 perimenopausal women between 45 and 55 years of age recruited from the general population were treated for menopausal symptoms by six experienced practitioners of Chinese medicine at the Polyclinic of the University of Westminster. Practitioners were instructed to treat as near to their usual practice style as possible. This involved using Chinese herbal medicine and/or acupuncture along with dietary and lifestyle advice. A maximum of 12 treatments over 6 months was allowed per patient. OUTCOME MEASURES: The menopause specific quality of life questionnaire (MenQoL), the Greene climacteric scale, and flushing diaries were used to evaluate treatment outcomes. Liver and kidney function tests were carried out at intake and after 1, 6 and 12 treatments to evaluate the safety particularly in relation to the use of herbal medicines. RESULTS: Patients showed significant improvement across all domains measured by the MenQoL and Greene climacteric scales. Reduction on the MenQoL scale between first and last visit was from 4.31 to 3.27 (p<0.001) and on the Green climacteric scale from 21.01 to 13.00 (p<0.001). Study participants did not reliably complete their flushing diaries. No adverse events or abnormal liver or kidney function values were observed during the course of the study. CONCLUSIONS: Further research that seeks to investigate the effects observed in more detail and to evaluate them against other forms of treatment and/or no-treatment controls is warranted. This could be achieved by way of a pragmatic randomized controlled trial that evaluated Chinese medicine against orthodox medical care.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#7333,Acupuncture benefits to women with recurrent implantation failure: A propensity score-matched cohort study,"OBJECTIVES: The current study aims to assess the effectiveness of acupuncture in improving the live birth rate (LBR), ongoing pregnancy rate (OPR), clinical pregnancy rate (CPR), biochemical pregnancy rate (BPR), and pregnancy loss (early abortion rate, late abortion rate, ectopic pregnancy rate) in patients with recurrent implantation failure (RIF). DESIGN: This retrospective study compares the outcomes of patients with RIF who underwent frozen embryo transfer (FET) with or without acupuncture. SETTING: The medical records of patients diagnosed with RIF and visiting Chengdu Xi'nan Gynecological Hospital between January 2018 and June 2021 were reviewed. The Chengdu Xi'nan Gynecological Hospital Ethics Committee approved this retrospective study (No. 2021-029). PARTICIPANTS: A total of 923 patients with RIF who underwent FET were included in this study. The patients were divided into two groups: the Acupuncture (n = 303) and the Non-acupuncture groups (n = 620). EXPOSURE: The Acupuncture group consisted of 303 RIF patients who received acupuncture therapy in addition to standard hormone replacement therapy (HRT)/delayed hormone replacement therapy (d-HRT) for FET. The Non-acupuncture group consisted of 620 RIF patients who received only standard HRT/d-HRT for FET. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the LBR. The secondary outcome referred to OPR, CPR, BPR, and pregnancy loss. RESULTS: The Acupuncture group had significantly higher BPR (P = 0.08) and CPR (P = 0.049) than the Non-acupuncture group. A potentially higher LBR (P = 0.16) and OPR (P = 0.248) were observed in the Acupuncture group than in the Non-acupuncture group. However, the survival analysis did not show that acupuncture significantly promoted live birth. CONCLUSIONS: Acupuncture is an appropriate adjunctive technique in the in vitro fertilization process as it improves biochemical and clinical pregnancies. Therefore, it is necessary to be cautious about the role of acupuncture throughout the whole pregnancy cycle.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#7355,Agreement of Risk-of -Bias varied in systematic reviews on acupuncture and was associated with methodological quality,"OBJECTIVES: The objective of the study was to evaluate the consistency of risk of bias assessments for overlapping randomized controlled trials (RCTs) included in systematic reviews (SRs) on acupuncture. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Databases were searched for acupuncture SRs. A weighted kappa (κ) statistic was calculated, and logistic regression was used to explore the factors of disagreements. RESULTS: We included 241 RCTs from 109 SRs on acupuncture. The percentage disagreements ranged from 25% to 44%, with moderate agreement for random sequence generation (κ = 0.57), allocation concealment (κ = 0.50), and incomplete outcome data (κ = 0.50), besides fair agreement for blinding of participants and personnel (κ = 0.44), blinding of outcome assessment (κ = 0.31), and selective reporting (κ = 0.39). Only 19% RCTs were evaluated completely consistent. Methodological quality (random sequence generation, odds ratio (OR) = 3.46), international cooperation (allocation concealment, OR = 0.14; incomplete outcome data, OR = 0.14; selective reporting, OR = 0.05), and risk of bias reporting completeness score (selective reporting, OR = 0.53) significantly affected the relative odds of disagreements. CONCLUSION: The level of agreement varied from fair to moderate agreement depending on the risk of bias domain. Methodological quality appears to be an overarching factor to account for disagreements.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#7362,Auricular acupuncture effectively reduces state anxiety before dental treatment--a randomised controlled trial,"OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to analyse whether auricular acupuncture, acupuncture at the outer ear, could reduce state anxiety before dental treatment. METHODS: This prospective, randomised patient-blinded study with 182 patients compared anxiety before dental treatment following auricular acupuncture at the relaxation-, tranquillizer- and master cerebral points (auricular acupuncture group) versus acupuncture at sham points (finger-, shoulder- and tonsil points; sham group) and a non-intervention control group. Anxiety was assessed using the Spielberger State Trait Anxiety Inventory (German version) before auricular acupuncture and 20 min thereafter, immediately before dental treatment. RESULTS: Auricular acupuncture reduced state anxiety score more effectively from 54.7 ± 10.8 to 46.9 ± 10.4 (mean ± SD) than sham acupuncture from 51.9 ± 10.2 to 48.4 ± 10.0. In contrast, state anxiety in the control group increased from 51.0 ± 11.7 to 54.0 ± 11.6 (mean increase +3.0; CI +4.7 to +1.2). The decrease in state anxiety in both intervention groups was statistically significant (p < 0.001) when compared to the non-intervention control group. After correcting for group differences in baseline state anxiety, the reduction in anxiety was -7.3 score points (CI -9.0 to -5.6) in the auricular acupuncture group and -3.7 score points (CI -5.4 to -1.9) in the sham group (p = 0.008). CONCLUSION: Auricular acupuncture, a minimally invasive method, effectively reduces state anxiety before dental treatment. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Auricular acupuncture could be an option for patients scheduled for dental treatment, who experience an uncomfortable degree of anxiety and request an acute intervention for their anxiety.",No,No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No
#7372,Acupuncture for Bell's palsy,"OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to examine the efficacy of acupuncture in hastening recovery and reducing long-term morbidity from Bell's palsy. METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Trials Register, MEDLINE (January 1966-April 2006), EMBASE (January 1980-April 2006), LILACS (January 1982-April 2006), and the Chinese Biomedical Retrieval System (January 1978-April 2006) for randomized controlled trials using ""Bell's palsy"" and its synonyms, ""idiopathic facial paralysis"" or ""facial palsy"" as well as search terms including ""acupuncture."" Chinese journals in which we thought we might find randomized controlled trials or controlled clinical trials relevant to our study were hand searched. We reviewed the bibliographies of the randomized trials and contacted the authors and known experts in the field to identify additional published or unpublished data. We included all randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials involving acupuncture in the treatment of Bell's palsy, irrespective of any language restrictions. Two review authors identified potential articles from the literature search and extracted data independently using a data extraction form. The assessment of methodological quality included allocation concealment, patient blinding, differences at baseline of the experimental groups, and completeness of follow-up. Two (2) review authors assessed quality independently. All disagreements were resolved by discussion between the review authors. RESULTS: Six (6) studies including a total of 537 participants met the inclusion criteria. Five (5) of them used acupuncture while another one used acupuncture combined with drugs. No trials reported on the outcomes specified for this review. Harmful side-effects were not reported in any of the trials. Flaws in study design or reporting (particularly uncertain allocation concealment and substantial loss to follow-up) and clinical differences between trials prevented conclusions about the efficacy of acupuncture. CONCLUSIONS: The quality of the included trials was inadequate to allow any conclusion about the efficacy of acupuncture. More research with high-quality trials is needed.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#7378,Development of preparatory activity indexed by the contingent negative variation in children,"OBJECTIVES: The present study investigated the effect of age on task-specific preparatory activation induced by a spatial cue using the central cue Posner's paradigm. The behavioral responses and the contingent negative variation (CNV) generated between S1 (the warning stimulus) and S2 (the imperative stimulus) were compared between 16 healthy children (8-13 years old) and 17 healthy young adults (18-23 years old). METHODS: The EEG was recorded from 20 scalp sites of the International 10-20 system. The complete trial period included a central directional cue that was on for 300 ms and an attentive waiting period lasting 1360 ms. Finally, a peripheral target appeared, subtending a visual angle of 4.56 degrees and situated 2.28 degrees eccentrically in the horizontal meridian. The early and late components of the CNV appearing in the period between cue and target were analyzed. RESULTS: The CNV of children showed no contralateral cortical activation related to motor preparation. However, the young adults showed contralateral activation to the cue over motor areas. Both children and young adults showed cortical activation in posterior sensory areas, displaying a pattern of activation contralateral to the cue. Also, a positive parietal component appeared in children during the CNV period. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the motor preparation system in children is less mature than the sensory preparatory system. The children may have used strategies and brain areas different from those of the young adults to prepare for stimuli and responses.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#7388,Comparative study on the effects of bee venom pharmacopuncture according to the treatment method for knee osteoarthritis,"OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of bee venom pharmacopuncture (BVP) therapy according to the methods used to treat knee osteoarthritis (OA): intra-acupoint combined with intra-articular injection, intra-acupoint injection, and intra-articular injection. METHODS: A total of 69 patients were recruited by the Department of Acupuncture & Moxibustion at Dong- Eui Oriental University Hospital from February 1 to July 23, 2012. The patients were assigned to 3 groups: the first group with intra-acupoint combined with intraarticular BVP Injection (the experimental group), the 2nd group with intra-acupoint BVP injection (control groupⅠ), and the 3rd group with intra-articular BVP injection (control groupⅡ). The participants were assigned in the order in which they were recruited. Treatments were done twice a week, for a total of 9 times. The effectiveness was assessed by using the visual analouge scale (VAS) and the Korea Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (KWOMAC). RESULTS: All three groups exhibited significant VAS and KWOMAC effects. Moreover, the 4 week follow-up after the final treatment showed a persistence of BVP effects. However, when the groups were compared, no statistically significant differences in VAS and KWOMAC were noted, but when improvement was considered, the results showed that intra-articular injection was more effective than intra-acupoint injection. Especially, intra-acupoint combined with intra-articular injection was the most effective among the three treatments. CONCLUSIONS: Combining intra-acupoint with intraarticular injection, depending on the patient's symptoms, may produce better results when conservatively treating knee OA.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#7413,"Validation of a simplified sham acupuncture technique for its use in clinical research: a randomised, single blind, crossover study","OBJECTIVES: The validity of a new sham acupuncture technique was tested on acupuncture naïve healthy subjects. METHODS: The procedure was tested in accupoints LI4 and ST6 in a randomised, single blind and crossover study. The participants were blind to which technique they received. 32 healthy volunteers (15 men, 17 women, aged between 20 and 62 years, mean age 34 years) were recruited at the Universidad de la República, Uruguay. Interventions Participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups: (1) real acupuncture or (2) sham acupuncture. After 30 min, the patients were 'needled' again in a crossover design. Main outcome measures A yes/no questionnaire was used to assess the credibility and characteristics of the procedure. RESULTS: For the credibility question (do you think you received real acupuncture?) no statistically significant group differences were evident before or after the crossover. Subjects who answered yes to this question ranged from 14/16 (87.5%) before crossover to 10/16 (62.5%) after crossover for the sham and 12/16 (75%) before crossover to 15/16 (93.8%) after crossover for the real acupuncture. The question that showed a significant difference (only after crossover) was the question, ""did you feel the needle penetrating the skin?""; after crossover 12/16 (75%) subjects in the real acupuncture group said yes and 2/16 (12%) subjects in the sham group said yes to this question (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggests that this method is credible and constitutes a simple and inexpensive technique for use as a control in clinical research in acupuncture naïve subjects.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#7420,Investigation into the effects of using two or four acupuncture needles with bidirectional rotation on experimentally-induced contact heat pain in healthy subjects,"OBJECTIVES: There is growing evidence from experimental studies that the acupuncture dose or technique influences the speed of onset of hypoalgesia. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of acupuncture using two or four needles on experimental contact thermal pain in healthy volunteers. METHODS: Forty two participants were randomised into three groups: four-needle group (LI4, LI11, LI10, TE5), two-needle group (verum at LI4, LI11 and mock at LI10, TE5) and mock acupuncture group (LI4, LI11, LI10, TE5). Each participant rated pain intensity (visual analogue scale, VAS) to a series of noxious stimuli administered to the forearm 2°C above the heat pain threshold during needling and immediately after removal of the needles. RESULTS: Experimentally-induced heat pain intensity (VAS) during and after the intervention was lower than pre-intervention but there were no statistically significant differences in this change between groups. There were no statistically significant differences between groups in the time taken for pain intensity to decrease by 33% from pre-intervention. However, a 33% decrease in pain intensity within 3 min of needle insertion was observed for 13 participants (92.9%) in the four-needle group compared with 66.7% of participants in the two-needle group and 57.1% in the mock acupuncture group. There was less variance in VAS in the four-needle group, suggesting more consistency in hypoalgesic response when using more needles. CONCLUSIONS: There is tentative evidence that four needles may be superior to two needles in generating rapid onset hypoalgesia. The findings suggest that further investigation is warranted.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes
#7441,"Non-penetrating sham needle, is it an adequate sham control in acupuncture research?","OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine whether a non-penetrating sham needle can serve as an adequate sham control. DESIGN: We conducted a randomised, subject-blind, sham-controlled trial in both acupuncture-naïve and experienced healthy volunteers. SETTING AND INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomly allocated to receive either real acupuncture (n=39) or non-penetrating sham acupuncture (n=40) on the hand (LI4), abdomen (CV12) and leg (ST36). The procedures were standardised and identical for both groups. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Participants rated acupuncture sensations on a 10-point scale. A blinding index was calculated based on the participants' guesses on the type of acupuncture they had received (real, sham or do not know) for each acupuncture point. The association of knowledge about and experience in acupuncture with correct guessing was also examined. RESULTS: The subjects in both groups were similar with respect to age, gender, experience or knowledge about acupuncture. The sham needle tended to produce less penetration, pain and soreness only at LI4. Blinding appeared to be successfully achieved for ST36. Although 41% of participants in the real acupuncture group made correct guesses for LI4, 31% guessed incorrectly for CV12, beyond chance level. People with more experience and knowledge about acupuncture were more likely to correctly guess the type of needle they received at ST36 only, compared to that at the other points. CONCLUSIONS: A non-penetrating sham needle may successfully blind participants and thus, may be a credible sham control. However, the small sample size, the different needle sensations, and the degree and direction of unblinding across acupuncture points warrant further studies in Korea as well as other countries to confirm our finding. Our results also justify the incorporation of formal testing of the use of sham controls in clinical trials of acupuncture.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,Yes
#7445,Acupuncture and moxibustion as adjunctive therapy for postoperative gastrointestinal dysfunction in gastric cancer: a systematic review and network meta-analysis,"OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate and compare the efficacy and safety of different acupuncture and moxibustion techniques as adjunctive therapy in addressing Postoperative gastrointestinal dysfunction (PGD) associated with gastric cancer (GC). METHODS: Eight medical databases were comprehensively searched for relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) as of October 2024. A network meta-analysis (NMA) was performed using frequency models, combining all available direct and indirect evidence from RCTs. Time of first bowel sounds (TFBS) was set as the primary outcome, and time to first defecation (TFD) and time to first flatus (TFF) were set as the secondary outcomes. All outcomes were ranked using surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) probabilities to determine a hierarchy of treatments, and the probability that the intervention will be in one of the top ranks increases with a higher SUCRA value. RESULTS: With 28 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 2,459 patients, 18 of which involved adjuvant acupuncture treatments. NMA based on SUCRA rankings showed that routine care (RC) with acupuncture (ACU), with acupressure (ACUP), with moxibustion (MOX) and acupoint injection (AI) were the top-ranked therapies for shortening TFBS and TFF in patients with GC compared with RC; additionally, RC + MOX + CUP and RC + MOX were the relatively best therapies for TFD. No serious adverse events were reported in the studies assessing the safety of adjunctive acupuncture therapy. Our study found that ST36, ST37, ST39, and PC6 were the most commonly used acupoints for adjuvant acupuncture treatments in treating PGD associated with GC. CONCLUSION: Acupuncture and moxibustion, when used as supplementary therapies, demonstrated efficacy and relative safety in managing PGD associated with GC. The recommended order for adjunctive acupuncture- and moxibustion-related therapies for PGD in patients with GC, in terms of conservativeness, is as follows: RC + ACU, RC + MOX + AI, RC + ACUP, RC + MOX + CUP and RC + MOX. Despite their inclusion, the overall methodological quality of the studies was poor, which need for further high-quality randomized controlled trials to support existing results.

#7452,Acupuncture and moxibustion for endometriosis: A systematic review and analysis,"OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to examine the effect of acupuncture on symptoms and health-related quality of life in patients with endometriosis. METHODS: Nine biomedical databases were searched to April 2022 to identify randomized controlled trials of acupuncture and/or moxibustion used alone or as adjunct to guideline-recommended pharmacotherapy for the treatment of endometriosis. One reviewer extracted data and another verified the data. A random effects model was used to calculate mean differences. RESULTS: Fifteen trials involving 1018 patients met the inclusion criteria, but diversity in comparisons and outcome measures prevented meta-analysis. Compared to sham acupuncture, manual acupuncture was more effective at reducing dysmenorrhea VAS pain score (mean difference [MD] - 2.40, 95 % CI [- 2.80, - 2.00]; moderate certainty evidence), pelvic pain VAS score (MD - 2.65, 95 % CI [- 3.40, - 1.90]; high certainty evidence) and dyspareunia VAS scores (MD - 2.88, [- 3.83, - 1.93]), lessened the size of ovarian cyst (MD - 3.88, 95 % CI [- 7.06, - 0.70]), and improved quality of life. Compared to conventional therapy, manual acupuncture plus conventional therapy and warm needle alone resulted in greater improvements in quality of life than conventional therapy. Among the six studies that reported safety, fewer adverse events were reported in participants who received acupuncture or moxibustion. CONCLUSIONS: Low to moderate certainty evidence from single studies showed that manual acupuncture may improve pain-related symptoms and quality of life; however, there is insufficient evidence on the overall effectiveness of acupuncture and moxibustion for endometriosis.",No,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#7457,Integrative Effects of Transcutaneous Electrical Acustimulation and Autonomic-Endocrine Mechanisms on Postprocedural Recovery in Patients With Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangio-Pancreatography,"OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the integrative effects and mechanisms of transcutaneous electrical acustimulation (TEA) on postprocedural recovery from endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 86 patients for elective ERCP were randomly ordered to receive TEA (n = 43) at acupoints PC6 and ST36 or Sham-TEA (n = 43) at sham points from 24 hours before ERCP (pre-ERCP) to 24 hours after ERCP (PE24). Scores of gastrointestinal (GI) motility-related symptoms and abdominal pain, gastric slow waves, and autonomic functions were recorded through the spectral analysis of heart rate variability; meanwhile, circulatory levels of inflammation cytokines of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin (IL)-10 and GI hormones of motilin, ghrelin, cholecystokinin (CCK), and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: 1) TEA, but not Sham-TEA, decreased the post-ERCP GI motility-related symptom score (2.4 ± 2.6 vs 7.9 ± 4.6, p < 0.001) and abdominal pain score (0.5 ± 0.7 vs 4.1 ± 2.7, p < 0.001) at PE24, and decreased the post-ERCP hospital day by 20.0% (p ＜0.05 vs Sham-TEA); 2) TEA improved the average gastric percentage of normal slow waves and dominant frequency by 34.6% and 33.3% at PE24, respectively (both p < 0.001 vs Sham-TEA); 3) TEA, but not Sham-TEA, reversed the ERCP-induced increase of TNF-α but not IL-10 at PE24, reflected as a significantly lower level of TNF-α in the TEA group than in the Sham-TEA group (1.6 ± 0.5 pg/mL vs 2.1 ± 0.9 pg/mL, p ＜ 0.01); 4) compared with Sham-TEA, TEA increased vagal activity by 37.5% (p ＜ 0.001); and 5) TEA caused a significantly higher plasma level of ghrelin (1.5 ± 0.8 ng/ml vs 1.1 ± 0.7 ng/ml, p ＜ 0.05) but not motilin, VIP, or CCK than did Sham-TEA at PE24. CONCLUSION: TEA at PC6 and ST36 accelerates the post-ERCP recovery, reflected as the improvement in GI motility and amelioration of abdominal pain, and suppression of the inflammatory cytokine TNF-α may mediate through both autonomic and ghrelin-related mechanisms.",No,No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No
#7492,A Pilot Study on Single-dose Toxicity Testing of Scolopendrid Pharmacopuncture in Sprague-Dawley Rats,"OBJECTIVES: This study was performed to analyze single dose toxicity and the lethal dose of Scolopendrid Pharmacopuncture in rats. METHODS: All experiments were conducted at the Korea Testing & Research Institute (KTR), an institution authorized to perform non-clinical studies, under the regulations of Good Laboratory Practice (GLP). Sprague-Dawley rats were chosen for the pilot study. Doses of Scolopendrid pharmacopuncture, 0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 mL, were administered to the experimental group, and 1.0 mL doses of normal saline solution were administered to the control group. This study was conducted under the approval of the Institutional Animal Ethic Committee. RESULTS: No deaths or abnormalities occurred in any of the groups. No significant changes in the weight, hematological parameters or clinical chemistry were noted between the control group and the experimental group. To check for abnormalities in organs and tissues, we used microscopy to examine representative histological sections of each specified organ; the results showed no significant differences in any of the organs or tissues. CONCLUSION: The above findings suggest Scolopendrid Pharmacopuncture is a relatively safe to use for treatment. Further studies on the subject should be conducted to yield more concrete evidence.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#7496,Single Intramuscular-dose Toxicity of Samgihwalryeok-Pharmacopuncture in Sprague-Dawley Rats,"OBJECTIVES: This study was performed to examine the single-dose toxicity of Samgihwalryeok pharmacopuncture. METHODS: Forty six-week-old Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were divided into four groups of 10 rats each; each group was then sub-divided into two smaller groups, one of five males and the other of five females. Group 1 (G1, control) received 1.0 mL of normal saline solution, while group 2 (G2, low-dose group), group 3 (G3, mid-does group, and group 4 (G4, high-dose group) received 0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 mL of Samgihwalryeok pharmacopuncture, respectively. RESULTS: No mortalities or clinical signs were observed in the four groups. Also, no significant changes in body weights were observed among the group, and no significant differences in hematology/biochemistry, necropsy, or histopathology results were noted. CONCLUSION: The above findings suggest that treatment with Samgihwalryeok pharmacopuncture is relatively safe. Further studies on this subject are needed.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#7514,Acupuncture as a complementary therapy to the pharmacological treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee: randomised controlled trial,"OBJECTIVES: To analyse the efficacy of acupuncture as a complementary therapy to the pharmacological treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee, with respect to pain relief, reduction of stiffness, and increased physical function during treatment; modifications in the consumption of diclofenac during treatment; and changes in the patient's quality of life. DESIGN: Randomised, controlled, single blind trial, with blinded evaluation and statistical analysis of results. SETTING: Pain management unit in a public primary care centre in southern Spain, over a period of two years. PARTICIPANTS: 97 outpatients presenting with osteoarthritis of the knee. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomly separated into two groups, one receiving acupuncture plus diclofenac (n = 48) and the other placebo acupuncture plus diclofenac (n = 49). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The clinical variables examined included intensity of pain as measured by a visual analogue scale; pain, stiffness, and physical function subscales of the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (WOMAC) osteoarthritis index; dosage of diclofenac taken during treatment; and the profile of quality of life in the chronically ill (PQLC) instrument, evaluated before and after the treatment programme. RESULTS: 88 patients completed the trial. In the intention to treat analysis, the WOMAC index presented a greater reduction in the intervention group than in the control group (mean difference 23.9, 95% confidence interval 15.0 to 32.8) The reduction was greater in the subscale of functional activity. The same result was observed in the pain visual analogue scale, with a reduction of 26.6 (18.5 to 34.8). The PQLC results indicate that acupuncture treatment produces significant changes in physical capability (P = 0.021) and psychological functioning (P = 0.046). Three patients reported bruising after the acupuncture sessions. CONCLUSIONS: Acupuncture plus diclofenac is more effective than placebo acupuncture plus diclofenac for the symptomatic treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes
#7517,Effects of acupuncture in patients with chronic kidney disease: a systematic review,"OBJECTIVES: to analyze the effects of acupuncture techniques in patients with chronic kidney disease. METHODS: a systematic review conducted in six databases, from September to December 2017, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses' criteria. The following descriptors were used: Acupuncture AND Chronic Renal Insufficiency AND Clinical Trial. RESULTS: nine studies were selected; the acupuncture techniques used were auriculotherapy, electroacupuncture and acupressure aimed at improving quality of life, fatigue, sleep and clinical variables of the disease. The studies that assessed quality of life, sleep and fatigue presented significant benefits. Studies that assessed quality of life, sleep and fatigue presented significant benefits. There was no statistical significance in the improvement of serum creatinine levels and glomerular filtration rate.

#7521,"Battlefield acupuncture added no benefit as an adjunct analgesic in emergency department for abdominal, low back or limb trauma pain","OBJECTIVES: To ascertain whether ear acupuncture (modified Battlefield technique) as an adjunct (Adj-BFA) to standard analgesia care (SAC) significantly reduces pain scores compared with sham acupuncture (Adj-Sham) or SAC alone, when delivered by medical and nursing practitioners in an ED. METHODS: A randomised controlled trial using a convenience sample of 90 patients attending an ED with acute abdominal, limb trauma or low back pain were allocated to three treatment arms: Adj-BFA, Adj-Sham and SAC. The primary outcome of change in pain scores out-of-10 (NPRS-10) from triage were assessed immediately after intervention and at 1 and 2 h post-intervention. Secondary outcomes were the percentage of patients reporting 'adequate analgesia' or ≥30% reduction in pain score, analgesic medication use (in morphine equivalent dose [milligrammes]), analgesics and needle costs (Australian dollars), adverse effects and patient satisfaction (Likert scale). RESULTS: There was no significant difference in pain scores (P = 0.582) or secondary outcomes measures between Adj-BFA, Adj-Sham and SAC. CONCLUSION: The present study on 90 patients did not show a significant difference in analgesia outcomes in the first 2 h using Adj-BFA for acute pain in the ED, and there were no significant differences for secondary outcomes between treatment arms. Given the mixed results of recent BFA trials, further research using the original BFA technique on different painful conditions, as either stand-alone or as-adjunct to non-opioid analgesia are needed before BFA can be recommended as a technique for acute pain management in the ED.",No,No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No
#7526,The effectiveness of relaxation acupoint stimulation and acupressure with aromatic lavender essential oil for non-specific low back pain in Hong Kong: a randomised controlled trial,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect of acupoint stimulation with electrodes combined with acupressure using an aromatic essential oil (lavender) as an add-on-treatment on pain relief and enhancing the physical functional activities among adults with sub-acute or chronic non-specific low back pain. DESIGN: Randomised controlled trial. SETTING: The community centre, Old-Aged Home and Women Workers Association, Hong Kong. INTERVENTION: 8-session relaxation acupoint stimulation followed by acupressure with lavender oil over a 3-week period. The control group received usual care only. OUTCOME MEASURES: Changes from baseline to the end of treatment were assessed in pain intensity (by Visual Analogue Scale) and duration; lateral fingertip-to-ground distance in centimetres; walking time and interference on daily activities. RESULTS: The baseline VAS scores for the intervention and control groups were 6.38 (S.E.M. = 0.22) and 5.70 (S.E.M. = 0.37) out of 10, respectively ( P=0.24 ). One week after the end of treatment, the intervention group had 39% greater reduction in VAS pain intensity than the control group ( P=0.0001 ), improved walking time ( P=0.05 ) and greater lateral spine flexion range ( P=0.01 ). CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that 8-sessions of acupoint stimulation followed by acupressure with aromatic lavender oil were an effective method for short-term LBP relief. No adverse effects were reported. To complement mainstream medical treatment for sub-acute LBP, the combined therapy of acupoint stimulation followed by acupressure with aromatic lavender oil may be one of the choices as an add-on therapy for short-term reduction of LBP.",No,No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No
#7529,Acupressure for primary dysmenorrhoea: a systematic review,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of acupressure for the symptomatic treatment of primary dysmenorrhoea from randomised controlled trials (RCTs). STUDY DESIGN: Electronic databases including English, Korean, Japanese and Chinese databases were systematically searched for RCTs investigating acupressure for primary dysmenorrhoea up to July 2008 with no language restrictions. The methodological qualities of eligible studies were assessed using the criteria described in the Assessing risk of bias of the Cochrane Handbook edited by Higgins and Altman. RESULTS: Four RCTs comprising a total of 458 participants were systematically reviewed. Only one of the included trials described adequate methods of randomisation. All trials did not have clear descriptions of their method of allocation concealment. Two studies reported significant improvements in the severity of pain for acupressure compared with sham acupressure on non-acupoints. Acupressure reduced the pain and anxiety typical of dysmenorrhoea in a Taiwan study. The U.S. study using an acupressure device reported that the reduction of menstrual pain was significantly better in worst menstrual pain, menstrual pain symptom intensity and the consumption of pain medication, compared with conventional treatment. One study investigated adverse events and reported that there was no adverse event in acupressure treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The available data from RCTs suggest that acupressure alleviates menstrual pain. These results were limited by the small number of trials. Well-designed RCTs with rigorous methods of randomisation, and adequately concealed allocation, are needed.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#7540,Auricular acupressure on specific points for hemodialysis patients with insomnia: a pilot randomized controlled trial,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the feasibility and acceptability of a randomized controlled trial compared auricular acupressure (AA) on specific acupoints with AA on non-specific acupoints for treating maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients with insomnia. METHODS: Sixty three (63) eligible subjects were randomly assigned into either AA group received AA on specific acupoints (n=32), or sham AA (SAA) group received AA on points irrelevant to insomnia treatment (n=31) for eight weeks. All participants were followed up for 12 weeks after treatments. The primary outcome was clinical response at eight weeks after randomization, defined as a reduction of Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) global score by 3 points and more. RESULTS: Fifty-eight (58) participants completed the trial and five dropped out. Twenty participants in AA group (62.5%) and ten in SAA group (32.3%) responded to the eight-week interventions (χ2 = 5.77, P = 0.02). PSQI global score declined 3.75 ± 4.36 (95%CI -5.32, -2.18) and 2.26 ± 3.89 (95%CI -3.68, -0.83) in AA group and SAA group respectively. Three participants died during the follow-up period. No evidence supported their deaths were related to the AA intervention. No other adverse event was observed. CONCLUSION: Feasibility and logistics of patient recruitment, randomization procedure, blinding approach, interventions application and outcome assessment had been tested in this pilot trial. The preliminary data appeared to show a favorable result on AA treatment. A full-scale trial is warranted.

#7542,"Acupuncture improves symptoms in patients with mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis: A randomized, sham-controlled preliminary trial","OBJECTIVES: To assess the feasibility of a definitive trial investigating the effects of acupuncture on atopic dermatitis symptoms including itching. DESIGN: A randomized, sham-controlled preliminary trial with three arms with a 4-week intervention period and a 4-week follow-up. INTERVENTIONS: Thirty participants were allocated to three arms (the verum acupuncture group 1 [VA1, 3 times weekly for 4 weeks], the verum acupuncture group 2 [VA2, twice weekly for 4 weeks], and the sham acupuncture group [SA, twice weekly for 4 weeks]) at a 1:1:1 ratio. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We determined the visual analogue scale (VAS) for itching and insomnia, SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD), Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI), Patient Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM), and Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) scores over the course of the study. Baseline index score (BIS) comparison according to general symptom was performed. RESULTS: The SCORAD, VAS (Pruritus), VAS (Insomnia), POEM, DLQI, and EASI were significantly improved in the VA groups. Significant BIS mean differences were observed most predominantly in epigastric tenderness and dyspepsia. There was no significant difference between VA1 and VA2 groups in all the main evaluation indices. CONCLUSIONS: For the following research, the authors suggest SCORAD (Total) as primary outcome and SCORAD (objective), VAS (Itch), VAS (insomnia), EASI, POEM, and DLQI as secondary outcomes. Thirty six participants should be conducted a 4-week acupuncture period (twice weekly) and a 4-week follow-up.

#7547,External validity in randomised controlled trials of acupuncture for osteoarthritis knee pain,"OBJECTIVES: To assess two aspects of the external validity of acupuncture research for osteoarthritis knee pain and determine the common acupoints and treatment parameters used. METHODS: The external validity of 16 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) was investigated using a scale consisting of two aspects: reporting and performance. The reporting aspect included acupuncturist's background, study location, treatment detailed, patient characteristics, positive trial results, adverse effects and between-group statistical differences, whereas treatment appropriateness, appropriate controls and outcomes were classified as the performance aspect. Acupuncture treatment in RCTs was compared with common practice according to the literature sources and survey of acupuncturists working in different parts of Thailand. RESULTS: The levels of external validity for the reporting and performance aspects were in the range of 31.3% to 100%. Statistic values such as mean difference and confidence interval were reported by the minority of trials (43.8%). Patient satisfaction and quality of life were seldom used (31.3%). There were minor differences between research and practice in terms of the points used (25.0%), number of treatment sessions (6.3%) and frequency (12.5%). The most frequently used points were ST34, ST35, ST36, SP6, SP9, SP10, GB34, Xiyan and ah shi points, and the commonly used treatment parameters were 20 minutes, 10-15 sessions and two treatments weekly. CONCLUSIONS: Reporting of the external validity of acupuncture RCTs for knee pain was notably inadequate in terms of trial setting, treatment provider and statistical reporting. The majority of studies involved appropriate controls and outcomes and applied acupuncture treatments in line with practice.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#7565,A blinded randomised trial of acupuncture (manual and electroacupuncture) compared with a non-penetrating sham for the symptoms of osteoarthritis of the knee,"OBJECTIVES: To compare the effect of acupuncture (manual and electroacupuncture) with that of a non-penetrating sham ('placebo' needle) in patients with osteoarthritic knee pain and disability who are blind to the treatment allocation. METHODS: Acupuncture naïve patients with symptomatic and radiological evidence of osteoarthritis of the knee were randomly allocated to a course of either acupuncture or non-penetrating sham acupuncture using a sheathed 'placebo' needle system. Acupuncture points for pain and stiffness were selected according to acupuncture theory for treating Bi syndrome. Both manual and electrical stimulation were used. Response was assessed using the WOMAC index for osteoarthritis of the knee, self reported pain scale, the EuroQol score and plasma beta-endorphin. The effectiveness of blinding was assessed. RESULTS: There were 34 patients in each group. The primary end point was the change in WOMAC pain score after the course of treatment. Comparison between the two treatment groups found a significantly greater improvement with acupuncture (mean difference 60, 95% CI 5 to 116, P= 0.035) than with sham. Within the acupuncture group there was a significant improvement in pain (baseline 294, mean change 95, 95% CI 60 to 130, P<0.001) which was not seen by those who had sham acupuncture (baseline 261, mean change 35, 95% CI -10 to 80, P=0.12). Similar effects within group, but not between groups, were seen with the secondary end points of WOMAC stiffness, WOMAC function, and self reported pain. One month after treatment the between group pain difference had been lost (mean difference 46; 95% CI -9 to 100, P=0.10) although the acupuncture group was still benefiting compared to baseline (mean difference 59; 95% CI 16 to 102, P=0.009). The EuroQol score, a generic measure of health related quality of life, was not altered by the treatments. A minority of patients correctly guessed their treatment group (41% in the acupuncture group and 44% in the control group). Plasma beta-endorphin levels were not affected by either treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Acupuncture gives symptomatic improvement for patients with osteoarthritis of the knee, and is significantly superior to non-penetrating sham acupuncture. The study did not confirm earlier reports of release of plasma beta-endorphin during acupuncture.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes
#7592,International research project to devise a protocol to test the effectiveness of acupuncture on painful shoulder,"OBJECTIVES: To describe in detail the questions and deliberations leading to the development of a methodologically rigorous protocol to test the effectiveness of acupuncture on painful shoulder. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial using three groups, including one control group. SETTINGS/LOCATION: A hospital in the north of Italy treating at least 8-10 painful shoulders a day, with physician/acupuncturists, physiotherapists, and assessors available to participate in the study. SUBJECTS: Sixty patients with monolateral painful shoulder. A list of exclusion criteria is given. INTERVENTIONS: Acupuncture + mobilization; mobilization alone (control); ear acupuncture + mobilization. OUTCOME MEASURES: Severity of pain, scored on a visual analogue scale (VAS) and on the McGill Pain Questionnaire and restriction of range of motion (ROM) of the shoulder joint. Voluntary use of pain medication, Tenoxicam 20 mg, was added to the protocol. RESULTS: The research team developed a protocol and methodology that avoids the common flaws and difficulties of previous clinical trials on acupuncture.

#7593,"The diagnosis and treatment of chronic back pain by acupuncturists, chiropractors, and massage therapists","OBJECTIVES: To describe the diagnostic and therapeutic content of visits for chronic back pain to acupuncturists, chiropractors, and massage therapists. METHODS: Randomly selected acupuncturists, chiropractors, and massage therapists in two states were surveyed, and then eligible providers collected data on consecutive patient visits. The authors analyzed information on diagnosis, treatment, and self-care recommendations for chronic back pain patients collected during consecutive patient visits to these complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) providers. RESULTS: Back pain was the most common reason for visits to each of these providers, with chronic back pain representing about 10% of visits to acupuncturists, 20% of visits to chiropractors, and 12% of visits to massage therapists. Diagnosis by acupuncturists included traditional questioning and inspecting the patient as well as pulse and tongue assessment and palpation of the acupuncture meridians. Treatments usually included acupuncture needling, heat of some sort, and other modalities, such as East Asian massage, herbs, and/or cupping (application of suction cups to the skin). Lifestyle recommendations were common, particularly exercise and dietary counseling. Visits to chiropractors usually included spinal and muscle/soft tissue examinations and spinal manipulation. Soft tissue techniques (eg, ""active release""), stretch or strength training, and home exercise recommendations were much less common. Massage therapists usually performed a tissue assessment and commonly assessed range of motion. They emphasized Swedish, deep tissue, and trigger point massage techniques and usually made self-care recommendations, particularly increased water intake, hot/cold therapy, exercise, and body awareness. CONCLUSION: Information on the care patients routinely receive from CAM providers will help physicians better understand these increasingly popular forms of care.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#7603,Effect of neurogenic acupoint cupping on high sensitive C-reactive protein and pain perception in female chronic pelvic pain: A randomized controlled trial,"OBJECTIVES: To determine the effect of neurogenic acupoint dry cupping therapy on high sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) level, pain perception & intensity, and life impact of pelvic pain in women with chronic pelvic pain (CPP), with regard to the biological and neurophysiological impacts of dry cupping on acupoint. METHODS: Thirty women with CPP were randomly divided into two equal groups; the study group received dry cupping on neurogenic acupoints plus lifestyle modifications for 8 weeks (n=15), while the control group received only lifestyle modifications for 8 weeks (n=15). Women were assessed pre- and post-rehabilitation program with the hs-CRP blood test, the short-form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ), and the pelvic pain impact questionnaire (PPIQ). RESULTS: Comparing both groups post-treatment revealed that there were significant reductions in levels of hs-CRP, and scores of SF-MPQ & PPIQ (p<0.05) in the study group compared with the control group. Also, there were significant positive correlations between hs-CRP and both SF-MPQ ""Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), Present Pain Intensity (PPI) index & Pain Rating Index (PRI)"" and PPIQ (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: Neurogenic acupoint cupping therapy had significantly improving effects on the degree of inflammation, pain perception & intensity, and life impact of pelvic pain in women with CPP.",No,No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No
#7607,A pilot study on the use of acupuncture or pelvic floor muscle training for mixed urinary incontinence,"OBJECTIVES: To determine the feasibility and acceptability of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) acupuncture and pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) in reducing symptoms and bothersomeness in women with mixed urinary incontinence (MUI); and to estimate the sample size for a full scale trial. METHODS: Thirty-four women with MUI were randomly assigned to either 12 sessions of TCM acupuncture, 12 sessions of PFMT, or to a waiting list control group. Outcome measures included an assessment of interest to participate in the trial, identification of successful recruitment strategies, the appropriateness of eligibility criteria, and compliance with treatment. Clinical outcomes were assessed at baseline and 12 weeks, and included the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Urinary Incontinence-Short Form (ICIQ-UI SF), expectations of treatment effect, and adverse events. RESULTS: Recruitment was feasible and randomisation worked adequately by means of SurveyMonkey. SurveyMonkey does not permit stratification by ICIQ-UI SF baseline score. Fourteen of 22 women found the treatment options acceptable. The dropout rate was high, especially in the control group (6/12). Outcome forms were completed by 20 of 34 women. The median (IQR) changes of the ICIQ-UI SF scores in the acupuncture, physiotherapy, and waiting list group were 5.5 (2.3 to 6.8), 1.0 (-3.0 to 4.5), and 1.5 (-1.5 to 3.0), respectively, suggesting the need for a full scale trial. CONCLUSIONS: Women with MUI were willing to participate in this study. There is a need for adjusting eligibility criteria. A sample size of 129 women, 43 in three arms, is required. No major adverse events occurred.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes
#7612,A Pilot Observational Study of an Acupressure/Acupuncture Intervention in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder,"OBJECTIVES: To determine whether children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) would tolerate an acupressure/acupuncture intervention and whether parents would adhere to a twice-weekly, 8-week intervention protocol. Second, to further understand best measures to use to capture impact of intervention on behavioral and regulatory functions. DESIGN: This is an observational pilot study with pre-, mid-, and postintervention measures. SETTINGS/LOCATION: The intervention was carried out in a private practice office in a large metropolitan area. SUBJECTS: A total of 10 children of ages 3-10 years with ASD and one of their parents participated. INTERVENTIONS: A total of 16 biweekly treatment sessions of acupressure and/or acupuncture were carried out by a licensed acupuncturist, and a daily home-based acupressure intervention was carried out by a parent. OUTCOME MEASURES: Attendance, tolerance of intervention, parent compliance with home program, and parent compliance in completing daily diary and five standardized measures of behavioral and regulatory functions pre-, mid-, and postintervention were recorded. RESULTS: The 10 children in this observational study, collectively, tolerated the intervention and parents adhered to the 16 sessions, biweekly protocol, and home protocol, as well as completing daily diary and five standardized measures at three different time intervals. The five measurements appeared to be sensitive to behavioral and regulatory functions that may improve with this type of intervention. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this observational pilot study suggest that acupressure/acupuncture is a feasible intervention for children with ASD that merits rigorous evaluation through a randomized controlled trial.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No

DESIGN: A randomised single-blind controlled design was used to evaluate effects of EA and extremely superficial needle insertion, with the latter serving as a near-placebo control. SETTINGS: The Linköping University Hospital in Sweden. INTERVENTIONS: Fourteen treatments during 12 weeks with follow-ups at 3 and 6 months. OUTCOME MEASURES: General psychological well-being, mood and experience of climacteric symptoms. RESULTS: Mood Scale improved only in EA group and not until 12 weeks compared to baseline, from 110 to 129 (P = 0.01), and to 120 at 3-month follow-up (P = 0.04). Mood was significantly better than control at 8 (P = 0.05) and 12 weeks (P = 0.01). Visual analogue scale estimation of climacteric symptoms was decreased at 4 weeks in both groups, and lasted throughout the study period, in EA group from 5 to 2 (P = 0.04) and in control group from 5 to 3 (P = 0.02) at 6-month follow-up. Well-being was ameliorated from 4 weeks in EA and from 8 weeks in control group until end of study (P = 0.01, P = 0.03). No significant differences on climacteric symptoms or well-being existed between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study does not show that EA is better than superficial needle insertion for the amelioration of general psychological distress and experience of climacteric symptoms in women with vasomotor symptoms after menopause. However, the more pronounced effect on mood suggests that EA might have additional effects compared with superficial needle insertion.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes
#7629,Discrimination accuracy between real and sham press needles in the hands,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the blinding effectiveness of a modified blunt sham press needle on the basis of the ability of subjects to discriminate between real and sham acupuncture needles compared with their discrimination ability based on pure guessing, and to define differences between senses (touch and vision) in the rates of correctly identified needles. METHODS: Sixty-three healthy students and staff members were recruited through convenience sampling. First, real or sham acupuncture was randomly administered to the left LI4 point while subjects could not observe the needle tip. A real or sham needle tip was then shown to the subjects. Finally, a random combination of real or sham acupuncture needles were randomly administered to the left and right LI4 points, this time with the subjects observing the procedure. In all conditions the subjects gave their judgement as Yes or No in response to questions asking them to identify the needle type. The proportion of correct judgements (P(C)) was computed for the last part of the trial in left and right LI4 points, and the rates of correctly identified needles for each trial were obtained. RESULTS: The subjects' accuracy of discrimination between the real and sham acupuncture needles in left and right LI4 points was not significantly different from that based on pure guess (P(C)=0.50 (chance level)), which indicates complete inability to discriminate between needles. The rates of correctly identified needles using touch, vision and a combination of both senses were not significantly different (p=0.807). CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this study show that this sham acupuncture device successfully blinded subjects to real and sham press needles, suggesting that it is effective for subject blinding in studies on acupuncture using press needles, and facilitating evaluation of the effects of acupuncture in placebo-controlled trials using a rigorous scientific research methodology.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No
#7631,"Effects of Transcutaneous Electrical Acupoint Stimulation on Patients with Stable Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease: A Prospective, Single-Blind, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Study","OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the clinical effect of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation over acupoints (acu-TENS) on patients with stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). DESIGN: Prospective, single-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study. Settings/Locations: Outpatient center of West China Hospital, Sichuan University. PATIENTS: Fifty patients with stable COPD enrolled in the study. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups: the acu-TENS group (n=25), who underwent acu-TENS over acupoints of bilateral EX-B-1(Dingchuan), BL-13 (Feishu), BL-23 (Shenshu), ST-36 (Zusanli), and the placebo acu-TENS control group (n=25), who had the same electrode placement but no electrical output. Treatments were performed for 40-minute sessions every 2 days for 4 weeks. OUTCOME MEASURES: Lung function (forced expiratory volume in 1 second, percentage predicted (FEV(1)% predicted); forced vital capacity, percentage predicted (FVC% predicted), 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) and oxygen saturation (SpO(2)), COPD assessment test (CAT), and Dyspnea Visual Analogue Scale (DVAS) were assessed before and after the intervention. RESULTS: Compared to control group, FEV(1)% predicted was improved and CAT score was decreased significantly in the acu-TENS group after treatment (p<0.05). The DVAS score decreased significantly in the acu-TENS group (p=0.039), with a slight but insignificant improve in 6MWD, SpO(2), and FVC% predicted after treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Acu-TENS over acupoints of bilateral EX-B-1 (Dingchuan), BL-13 (Feishu), BL-23 (Shenshu), and ST-36 (Zusanli) improved FEV(1)% predicted and reduced DVAS and CAT scores on patients with stable COPD.

#7669,Acupuncture and the relaxation response for treating gastrointestinal symptoms in HIV patients on highly active antiretroviral therapy,"OBJECTIVES: To examine the effect of acupuncture and the relaxation response (RR) for treating gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in HIV patients who are using highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). METHODS: The authors conducted a 4-arm 2×2 double-blind randomised controlled trial in an acupuncture clinic in the USA. Sham acupuncture and health education were used as the control conditions of real acupuncture and RR elicitation, respectively. Enrolled patients were randomised to real acupuncture+RR (AR), sham acupuncture+RR (SR), real acupuncture+health education (AE) or sham acupuncture+health education (SE) study arm. Participants listened to CDs with RR-eliciting instructions or health education while receiving acupuncture intervention. Interventions were provided twice weekly for 4 weeks and once weekly for another 4 weeks. Participants used daily diaries to record GI symptom severity ratings (0-10). The authors estimated the intervention effect as the changes in symptom rating per intervention session increase using a mixed-effects regression model. RESULTS: A total of 130 people with HIV/AIDS who were on HAART and had persistent GI symptoms were enrolled and 115 started the study intervention. The AR group had greater intervention effects for loose stools symptoms than the other three groups (β=-0.149, -0.151 and -0.144, p value=0.013, 0.013 and 0.018 comparing AR to AE, SR and SE, respectively). The AR group also had significant intervention effects on reducing nausea symptoms when the intervention was given twice per week (β=-0.218, p=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our trial provided preliminary data demonstrating the potential synergistic effects of acupuncture and RR for treating GI symptoms in HIV patients on HAART.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes
#7680,Evaluation of Complementary and Integrative Health Approaches Among US Veterans with Musculoskeletal Pain Using Propensity Score Methods,"OBJECTIVES: To examine the treatment effectiveness of complementary and integrative health approaches (CIH) on chronic pain using Propensity Score (PS) methods. DESIGN, SETTINGS, AND PARTICIPANTS: A retrospective cohort of 309,277 veterans with chronic musculoskeletal pain assessed over three years after initial diagnosis. METHODS: CIH exposure was defined as one or more clinical visits for massage, acupuncture, or chiropractic care. The treatment effect of CIH on self-rated pain intensity was examined using a longitudinal model. PS-matching and inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) were used to account for potential selection and confounding biases. RESULTS: At baseline, veterans with (7,621) and without (301,656) CIH exposure differed significantly in 21 out of 35 covariates. During the follow-up period, on average CIH recipients had 0.83 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.77 to 0.89) points higher pain intensity ratings (range = 0-10) than nonrecipients. This apparent unfavorable effect size was reduced to 0.37 (95% CI = 0.28 to 0.45) after PS matching, 0.36 (95% CI = 0.29 to 0.44) with IPTW on the treated (IPTW-T) weighting, and diminished to null when integrating IPTW-T with PS matching (0.004, 95% CI = -0.09 to 0.10). An alternative IPTW model and conventional covariate adjustment appeared least powerful in terms of potential bias reduction. Sensitivity analyses restricting the follow-up period to one year after CIH initiation derived consistent results. CONCLUSIONS: PS-based causal methods successfully eliminated baseline difference between exposure groups in all measured covariates, yet they did not detect a significant difference in the self-rated pain intensity outcome between veterans who received CIHs and those who did not during the follow-up period.",Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#7692,Effects of Acupoint Application Therapy with TianGui Powder on Osteoporosis in Ovariectomized Rats through TGF-β1 and Smad2/3 Signaling Pathway,"OBJECTIVES: To explore the effects of acupoint application therapy (AAT) with TianGui Powder (TGP) on the expressions of the transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) and Smad-2/3 signaling pathway in ovariectomized osteoporosis rats. METHODS: Sixty rats were randomly divided into four groups: normal group (group A), model group (group B), TGP group (group C), and Western medicine group (group D). Group A had only the corresponding amount of adipose tissue around the ovary removed; rats in the other groups had bilateral ovariectomies. After 1 week, groups A and B were given 1 mL/100 mg normal saline solution by gavage, group C was treated with AAT with TGP on ShenQue acupoint (0.2 piece/rat, 6 h/time, 1 time/d) and group D was given calcium carbonate vitamin D3 (36 mg/kg/d) and alfacalcidol (0.05 μg/kg/d) tablet suspension. In this study, the bone mineral density (BMD) , the levels of BALP, TRAP-5b, and BGP in serum and the changes in bone histomorphology was detected. For acquiring lumbar experimental data, the expression of TGF-β1, Smad-2/3 proteins and mRNA of TGF-β1and Smad-2/3 were assessed. After 12 weeks, the data were collected for analysis. RESULTS: Compared with group A, the bone trabecula was thinner and significantly reduced in other groups. The result of BMD improved significantly in both groups C and D compared to group B after intervention (P < 0.05). In contrast, compared to group B, the levels of BALP, TRAP-5b, and BGP significantly declined in both groups C and D. In group C, the results of protein expressions in TGF-β1, Smad-2/3 were 2.870 ± 0.270, 1.552 ± 0.111, and 1.420 ± 0.079, respectively. In groups C and D, those indications significantly declined compared to group B (P < 0.01). In group C, the level of mRNA expressions of TGF-β1, Smad-2/3 were 1.872 ± 0.177, 1.672 ± 0.086, and 1.790 ± 0.136, respectively. Compared with group B, those indications had significant difference in groups C and D (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Acupoint application therapy with TGP could significantly improve the BMD. The TGF-β1 and Smad-2/3 signaling pathway could be a therapeutic target of TGP in postmenopausal osteoporosis rats.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#7699,[Study on the mechanism of moxibustion regulating ferroptosis-lipid metabolism pathway to improve synovitis inflammatory injury in rheumatoid arthritis rats],"OBJECTIVES: To explore the mechanism of moxibustion in improving synovitis inflammatory injury in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) model rats based on the ferroptosis-lipid metabolism pathway. METHODS: Forty-eight SD rats were randomly divided into normal, model, moxibustion and moxibustion + long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase 4 (ACSL4) inhibitor groups, with 12 rats in each group. The RA model was replicated using environmental factors of wind, cold, and dampness combined with Freund's complete adjuvant injection. The moxibustion group received moxibustion at ""Shenshu"" (BL23) and ""Zusanli"" (ST36) for 20 minutes per acupoint each time, once daily at a single acupoint (both sides) with alternating acupoints over 15 consecutive days. The moxibustion + ACSL4 inhibitor group received intraperitoneal injection of the ACSL4 inhibitor rosiglitazone (0.4 mg/kg) after moxibustion, once daily for 15 consecutive days. Histopathological changes in synovial tissue were observed using HE staining；serum contents of glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) were detected using biochemical methods；reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in synovial tissues were detected using flow cytometry；the expressions of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), ACSL4, and lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 3 (LPCAT3) proteins in synovial tissues were detected using Western blot；and serum contents of interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) were detected using ELISA. RESULTS: Compared with the normal group, the serum contents of GSH decreased (P<0.01) while MDA, IL-6, and TNF-α contents increased (P<0.01)；the ROS levels, ACSL4 and LPCAT3 protein expressions increased (P<0.01) while GPX4 protein expression decreased (P<0.01) in synovial tissue in the model group. Compared with the model group, the serum contents of GSH increased (P<0.01) while MDA, IL-6, and TNF-α contents decreased (P<0.01)；the ROS levels, ACSL4 and LPCAT3 protein expressions decreased (P<0.01) while GPX4 protein expression increased (P<0.01) in synovial tissue in the moxibustion group and moxibustion + ACSL4 inhibitor group. Compared with the moxibustion group, the serum contents of GSH increased (P<0.01) while MDA, IL-6, and TNF-α contents decreased (P<0.01)；the ROS levels, ACSL4 and LPCAT3 protein expressions decreased (P<0.01, P<0.05) while GPX4 protein expression increased (P<0.05) in synovial tissue in the moxibustion + ACSL4 inhibitor group. HE staining showed that the model group had significantly increased synovial hyperplasia and inflammatory cell infiltration；the moxibustion group and moxibustion + ACSL4 inhibitor group showed varying degrees of alleviation in inflammatory cell infiltration and hyperplasia in synovial tissue；compared with the moxibustion group, the moxibustion + ACSL4 inhibitor group showed more significant improvements in inflammatory infiltration and hyperplasia of synovial cells, reduced layers of synovium. CONCLUSIONS: Moxibustion at BL23 and ST36 can alleviate synovial inflammatory injury, and its mechanism may be related to reducing lipid peroxidation and ROS levels, and inhibiting the occurrence of ferroptosis.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#7704,Study on the mechanisms of acupuncture combined with paroxetine in the treatment of mild to moderate depression based on DNA methylation analysis,"OBJECTIVES: To explore the therapeutic effect of acupuncture combined with paroxetine for mild to moderate depression and the regulatory role of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in patients based on DNA methylation. METHODS: A total of 66 patients with mild to moderate depression who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were randomly divided into an observation (acupuncture+medication) group and a control (medication) group, with 33 patients in each group, and other 25 healthy volunteers were taken as the healthy group. The patients of the control group were treated by oral administration of paroxetine 20 mg/d for 4 weeks. The patients of the observation group were treated by acupuncture stimulation of Zhongwan (CV12), Qihai (CV6), Zusanli (ST36), Sanyinjiao (SP6), Shangxing (GV23), Shuigou (GV26), Shaoshang (LU11), Yinbai (SP1) and Daling (PC7) (for 20 min, 3 times a week for 4 weeks) on the basis of medication treatment (the same as that of the control group). Before treatment, 2 and 4 weeks of treatment, and 2 weeks of follow-up, the therapeutic effect was assessed using Hamilton Depression Scale 17 (HAMD-17). The SPSS25.0 software was used to form a randomized grouping and to randomly select 25 patients from the observation group and 25 patients from the control group for blood collecting and data analysis. The blood samples were taken for assaying serum BDNF content and the methylation degree of BDNF gene promotor I with ELISA and MassARRAY techniques, respectively. RESULTS: 1) In comparison with those before treatment, the total score of HAMD-17, sleep disorder factor score, and anxiety somatization factor score of both the observation and control groups were significantly decreased after 2 and 4 weeks of treatment, and 2 weeks of follow-up (P<0.05), except sleep disorder factor score in the control group after 2 weeks of the treatment. Compared with the same time-points of the control group, the HAMD-17 total score and sleep disorder factor score of the observation group were decreased after 2 and 4 weeks of treatment, and 2 weeks of follow-up (P<0.05), while the anxiety somatization factor score was evidently decreased after 2 weeks of treatment (P<0.05). 2) Following 2 weeks of treatment, the total effective rate and markedly effective rate of the observation group were 80%(24/30)and 36.67% (11/30), respectively, being significantly higher than those ［(26.67% and 0 %)］ of the control group. After 4 weeks of treatment, the markedly effective rate of the observation group was 70.00% (21/30), being significantly higher than that 40% (12/30) of the control group (P<0.05), while the total effective rates of the observation and control groups were the same (100%). 3) Before the treatment, comparison among the healthy, observation and control groups showed no statistical significance in the methylation degree of each site (CpG1.2, CpG5.6, CpG8.9, CpG26, CpG27, CpG31, and CpG33.34) of BDNF gene promotor I, while after 4 weeks of the treatment, the methylation degree of CpG31 was considerably lower in the observation group than in the control group (P<0.05). 4) Before the treatment, the contents of serum BDNF of both observation and control group had no significant difference, but were evidently lower than that of the healthy group (P<0.05). Compared with that before treatment, the serum BDNF contents in both observation and control groups were significantly increased after the treatment (P<0.05), and was significantly higher in the observation group than in the control group (P<0.05). 5) The correlation analysis showed a negative correlation between the BDNF protein content and HAMD-17 score (correlation coefficient ρ=-0.686, P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Acupuncture may have an antidepressant role by decreasing CpG31 methylation of BDNF and increasing the serum content of BDNF protein in patients with depression. In addition, acupuncture combined with paroxetine has more advantages in treating mild to moderate depression than oral paroxetine alone, and can improve sleep disorders and anxiety somatization symptoms more quickly.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes
#7806,Effect of moxibustion on ureteral stent-related symptoms after ureteroscopic lithotripsy,"OBJECTIVES: To observe the clinical efficacy of moxibustion combined with western medication on ureteral stent-related symptoms after ureteroscopic lithotripsy (URL). METHODS: One hundred and fifty patients with upper urinary tract calculus implanted with ureteral stents after URL were randomly divided into a moxibustion group (50 cases, 1 case dropped out), a placebo moxibustion group (50 cases, 3 cases dropped out) and a blank control group (50 cases). No intervention was performed in the blank control group. On the basis of oral administration with tamsulosin hydrochloride sustained release capsule (starting from the first day after surgery, once a day, 0.2 mg each time, continuously for 4 weeks), in the moxibustion group, moxibustion was operated at Guanyuan (CV 4) and bilateral Shenshu (BL 23); the sham-moxibustion was delivered at the same acupoints in the placebo moxibustion group, once daily, 6 times a week, for 15 min in each treatment. The duration of treatment was 4 weeks. Before treatment, and after 1, 2 and 4 weeks of treatment, the scores of lower urinary tract symptoms, body pain, general health, work performance and satisfaction of sexual matters were compared among the 3 groups. The tract calculus clearance rate, urinary infection and the oral administration of painkillers were compared after 4 weeks of treatment in the 3 groups. RESULTS: The scores of lower urinary tract symptoms, body pain and general health after 1 week of treatment, and the scores of lower urinary tract symptoms, body pain, general health and work performance after 2 and 4 weeks of treatment were lower than those before treatment in the 3 groups (P<0.01). The scores of lower urinary tract symptoms and body pain in the moxibustion group after 1, 2 and 4 weeks of treatment were lower than those in the blank control group and the placebo moxibustion group (P<0.01, P<0.05) respectively. The score of general health in the moxibustion group was lower than that in the blank control group after 1 week of treatment (P<0.01), and lower than those of the blank control group and the placebo moxibustion group after 2 and 4 weeks of treatment (P<0.01, P<0.05). Regarding the score of work performance, it was lower in the moxibustion group after 1 and 2 weeks of treatment compared with those in the blank control group (P<0.05, P<0.01), and lower than those of the blank control group and the placebo moxibustion group after 4 weeks of treatment (P<0.01, P<0.05). The tract calculus clearance rate in the moxibustion group was 95.9% (47/49), higher than that in the blank control group (80.0%, 40/50, P<0.05). The proportion of oral administration of painkillers in the moxibustion group (28.6%, 14/49) and the placebo moxibustion group (40.4%, 19/47) was lower than that in the blank control group (76.0%, 38/50, P<0.01) respectively.

#7811,Effects of acupuncture on vision and visual function in children with anisometropic amblyopia,"OBJECTIVES: To observe the clinical efficacy of Tiaoqi Tongjing Mingmu acupuncture (acupuncture for regulating qi, unblocking meridians and brightening eyes) combined with conventional treatment for anisometropic amblyopia children. METHODS: A total of 76 children with monocular anisometropic amblyopia were randomized into an observation group (38 cases, 2 cases dropped out) and a control group (38 cases). The lens covering therapy was adopted in both groups. The conventional treatment i.e. red flash, grating and visual stimulation was given in the control group, 5 min for one item each time; on the basis of the treatment in the control group, acupuncture was applied at bilateral Jingming (BL 1), Cuanzhu (BL 2), Fengchi (GB 20) and Guangming (GB 37) in the observation group. Both groups were treated once every other day, 3 times a week for 4 weeks. Before and after treatment, the best corrected visual acuity, the latency and amplitude of P(100) wave of pattern visual evoked potential (P-VEP), the diopter (spherical equivalent [SE]) were observed, the stereoacuity was measured by Titmus stereoscopic examination, and the clinical efficacy was evaluated in both groups. RESULTS: Compared with those before treatment, the best corrected visual acuity improved (P<0.05), the latency of P-VEP P(100) wave was shortened and the amplitude of P-VEP P(100) wave was increased (P<0.05), and the SE and Titmus values were decreased (P<0.05) after treatment in both groups. After treatment, in the observation group, the best corrected visual acuity was higher (P<0.05), the latency of P-VEP P(100) wave was shorter and the amplitude of P-VEP P(100) wave was higher (P<0.05), SE and Titmus values were lower (P<0.05) than those in the control group. The total effective rate was 86.1% (31/36) in the observation group, which was superior to 65.8% (25/38) in the control group (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: During the visual plasticity period, Tiaoqi Tongjing Mingmu acupuncture combined with conventional treatment can effectively improve the best corrected vision, diopter and stereoacuity in children with anisometropic amblyopia, and enhance the nerve conduction function from retina to visual cortex. Its effect is superior to that of simple conventional treatment.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes
#7820,[Effect and mechanism of acupotomy tendon-sparing and knot-dissolving technique in inhibiting bone destruction in rats with rheumatoid arthritis based on the PI3K/AKT/NFATc1 pathway],"OBJECTIVES: To observe the effect of acupotomy tendon-sparing and knot-dissolving technique on bone destruction and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT)/nuclear factor of activated T cells c1 (NFATc1) pathway in rats with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), so as to investigate the underlying mechanism. METHODS: Forty SD rats were randomly divided into normal, model, medication (tripterygium wilfordii), and acupotomy groups, with 10 rats in each group. Except for the normal group, the rest of the rats were injected with bovine type II collagen emulsion at the base of tails to establish a collagen-induced RA model. The acupotomy group was treated with acupotomy tendon-sparing and knot-dissolving technique, once every 3 days, with a continuous intervention for 9 times. The medication group was given tripterygium wilfordii polyglycoside suspension (8 mg·kg(-1)) by gavage, once a day for 28 days continuously. The swelling degree of the ankle joint and the arthritis index score of the rats were observed. Micro-CT scanning was used to observe the degree of bone destruction in the left ankle joint. HE staining and ferruben-solid green staining were used to observe the pathological morphological changes of synovial and cartilage tissue respectively. ELISA was used to detect the contents of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6 and IL-17 in synovial tissue. Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining was used to observe the number of osteoclasts in the left ankle joint. Western blot was used to detect the expression levels of NFATc1, p-PI3K and p-AKT proteins in synovial tissue. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the positive expressions of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9), cathepsin K (CTSK) and TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) in the synovial tissue of the ankle joint. RESULTS: In comparison with the normal group, the bones of the ankle joint and toes of rats were severely eroded, with an uneven surface in the model group; there was a large number of inflammatory cell infiltrations in the synovial tissue, obvious damage to the articular cartilage, and disordered arrangement of synovial cells; the cartilage matrix was damaged, the cartilage layer was rough, and the subchondral bone structure was disordered. In comparison with the model group, the above histopathological changes in the medication group and the acupotomy group were alleviated. Compared with the normal group, the joint swelling degree, arthritis index, the ratio of bone surface area to bone volume (BS/BV), trabecular number (Tb.N), trabecular separation (Tb.Sp), the contents of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-17 in synovial tissue, the number of osteoclasts in the joint, the expressions or ratios of NFATc1, p-PI3K/PI3K, p-AKT/AKT proteins in synovial tissue, and the positive expressions of TRAF6, CTSK and MMP9 proteins in synovial tissue in the model group were significantly increased (P<0.01), while the bone mineral density (BMD), bone volume fraction (BV/TV) and trabecular thickness (Tb.Th) were significantly decreased (P<0.01). Compared with the model group, the joint swelling degree, arthritis index, BS/BV, Tb.Sp, the contents of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-17 in synovial tissue, the number of osteoclasts, the expressions or ratios of NFATc1, p-PI3K/PI3K, p-AKT/AKT proteins in synovial tissue, and the positive expressions of TRAF6, CTSK and MMP9 proteins in synovial tissue in the medication group and the acupotomy group were significantly decreased (P<0.01, P<0.05), while BMD, BV/TV and Tb.Th were significantly increased (P<0.01, P<0.05), and Tb.N in the acupotomy group was significantly decreased (P<0.01).

#7827,[Effects of acupuncture on intestinal microbiota in mice with rheumatoid arthritis],"OBJECTIVES: To observe the effect of acupuncture on gut microbiota in mice with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), so as to explore its mechanisms underlying improvement of RA. METHODS: Eighteen male C57BL/6J mice were randomly divided into saline, model and acupuncture groups, with 6 mice in each group. The RA model was established by injection of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA, 50 μL) into the right hind paw. Acupuncture group received manual acupuncture stimulation of the bilateral ""Zusanli"" (ST36) for 30 min, once daily for 7 days. The paw withdrawal thermal latency (PWTL) was detected by using a thermal pain detector. After the last intervention, the mice's feces were collected for extracting the feces DNA, and 16S RNA sequencing was used to detect and analyze the diversity and structural composition of intestinal flora. RESULTS: Compared with the saline group, the PWTL from day 0 to 7 after administration of CFA was significantly decreased (P<0.01), and the paw swelling volume from day 0 to 7 significantly increased in the model group (P<0.01). In comparison with the model group, the PWTL from day 1 to 7 was significantly increased (P<0.01), and the paw swelling volume on day 7 was strikingly decreased (P<0.01) in the acupuncture group. The Alpha diversity analysis of intestinal flora showed that the Chao1 index was markedly decreased in the model group compared with the saline group (P<0.05), and markedly increased in the acupuncture group compared with the model group (P<0.05). Beta diversity principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) displayed that the intestinal microbiota community structure of each group was different, and there were some overlapping areas, but they could be distinguished (P<0.01), suggesting that the species richness and diversity of RA mice were changed after acupuncture treatment. Compared with the saline group, the relative abundance of Bacteroidota was decreased (P<0.05), and that of Desulfobacterota and Escherichia-Shigella significantly increased (P<0.05) in the model group. In comparison with the model group, the relative abundance of Actinobacteria and Lactobacillus was considerably increased (P<0.05, P<0.01), while that of Escherichia-Shigella and Faecalibacterium strikingly decreased (P<0.05) in the acupuncture group. CONCLUSIONS: Acupuncture treatment can significantly alleviate joint inflammation in RA mice, which may be related to its function in regulating the diversity and composition of gut microbiota.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#7834,[Effect of acupuncture on intracerebral mitochondrial function in mice with cerebral hemorrhage],"OBJECTIVES: To observe the effect of acupuncture on the recovery of neurological function in mice with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), so as to explore its mechanism of regulating mitochondria in brain tissue of ICH mice through the utilization of RNA sequencing and m6A methylation sequencing technology. METHODS: Twenty-four male C57BL/6J mice were ramondly divided into sham operation, model, and acupuncture groups (n=8 in each group). The ICH model was established by injection of the rat's auto-blood (10 μL) into the right caudatum region. Acupuncture group received manual acupuncture stimulation of ""Baihui"" (GV20) for 30 min, once every 12 h for 7 d. After the intervention, the behavioral scores of mice in each group were evaluated. The contents of glutathione peroxidase malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in brain tissue were detected by ELISA. The N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification genes of ICH mice brain tissue were analyzed using RNA and m6A sequencing. The protein expression level of mitochondrial outer membrane translocase 20 (TOMM20) was detected by Western blot. The mRNA expression levels of Ndufb3、Ndufb6、Uqcr11、Cox7c、Ndufv1、Ndufb11 and Cytb were detected by PCR. RESULTS: Compared with the sham operation group, the suspension test score, balance walking test score, GSH-Px and SOD contents in the brain tissue were decreased (P<0.01), while the MDA content in the brain tissue was increased (P<0.01) in the model group. After the intervention and compared with the model group, the scores of the suspension test, the balance walking test and the contents of GSH-Px and SOD were increased (P<0.01, P<0.05), while the content of MDA was decreased (P<0.01) in the acupuncture group. RNA sequencing showed that a total of 780 differentially expressed genes were screened in the model group compared with the sham operation group, a total of 1 097 differentially expressed genes were screened in the acupuncture group compared with the model group, and the shared differential genes in the sham group vs model group and model group vs acupuncture group were 342;and 50 common differential genes were obtained after intersection with mitochondrial-related genes. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses of the screened differentially expressed genes revealed that the above differential genes were mainly enriched in the oxidative phosphorylation pathway. PCR and Western blot verification results showed that compared with the sham operation group, the expression levels of Ndufb3, Ndufb6, Uqcr11, Cox7c, Ndufv1, Ndufb11 and Cytb mRNA, and the expression level of TOMM20 protein were decreased (P<0.01) in the model group.

#7845,[Mechanism of electroacupuncture at "Zusanli" (ST36) in improving cardiac function in mice with chronic heart failure],"OBJECTIVES: To observe the effect of electroacupuncture (EA) at ""Zusanli"" (ST36) on improving cardiac function in mice with chronic heart failure (CHF), so as to explore the mechanism of its regulation on the autonomic nervous system. METHODS: Eighteen C57BL/6J mice were randomly divided into sham-surgery, model, and EA groups, with 6 mice in each group. The model of myocardial ischemia followed by CHF was induced by ligation of the anterior descending branch of the left coronary artery. Two weeks after modeling surgery, EA intervention (0.5 mA, 2 Hz/15 Hz) was performed bilaterally at ST36 in the EA group, 20 min each time, once every other day for 4 weeks. The left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), left ventricular fractional shortening (LVFS), left ventricular end-systolic diameter (LVESD), left ventricular end-systolic volume (LVESV), left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD), and left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) were evaluated using echocardiographic imaging. The exercise tolerance was observed in an exhaustive test. Electrocardiograms were recorded using an electrophysiological recording system to analyze heart rate (HR) changes before and after EA, and frequency domain analysis was used to analyze the heart rate variability (HRV), including low-frequency (LF) component, high-frequency (HF) component, and their ratio (LF/HF). Immunofluorescence was used to observe the number of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)(+)/c-fos(+) co-labeled neurons in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMV). RESULTS: In terms of cardiac function, compared with the sham-surgery group, the LVEF and LVFS were decreased (P<0.001) and the LVESD, LVEDD, LVESV, and LVEDV were increased (P<0.001, P<0.01) two weeks after modeling of mice in the model group. After 2 weeks of EA intervention, the LVESD and LVESV in the EA group were significantly smaller than those in the model group (P<0.05). After 4 weeks of intervention, the LVEF and LVFS in the EA group were significantly higher than those in the model group (P<0.05), and the LVESD and LVESV were significantly reduced (P<0.05, P<0.01). Compared with the model group, EA significantly improved the exercise tolerance of CHF mice (P<0.05). Compared with the sham-surgery group, the LF/HF in the model group and EA group were significantly increased (P<0.05) 2 weeks after modeling, indicating autonomic imbalance. After 4 weeks of intervention, the LF/HF in the EA group showed lower trend than that in the model group but the difference was not statistically significant. Additionally, after immediate EA, HR decreased (P<0.05, P<0.01), HF increased (P<0.01), and both LF and LF/HF decreased significantly (P<0.05) of mice in the EA group, indicating that EA corrected the autonomic imbalance in CHF mice. The number of ChAT(+)/c-fos(+) co-labeled neurons in the DMV of the EA group was significantly higher (P<0.001) than that in the model group. CONCLUSIONS: EA at ST36 significantly improved cardiac function and exercise tolerance in CHF mice. The underlying mechanism may be related to the activation of vagus efferent nerve and the regulation of autonomic nerve balance.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No

METHODS: Male Wistar rats were randomly divided into 5 groups:normal group, model group, EA group, sham EA group, and combination group, with 8 rats in each group. An insulin resistance obesity model was established using a high-fat diet. Rats in the EA group received EA at ""Zhongwan"" (CV12), ""Guanyuan"" (CV4), ""Zusanli"" (ST36), and ""Fenglong"" (ST40), with the needles retained for 10 min each time. The sham EA group underwent superficial needling 5 mm beside the acupoints of the EA group, with electrodes clamped but not powered, while the remaining procedures were identical to those in the EA group. The combination group was administered Sirtinol solution via tail vein injection, with the EA intervention identical to that in the EA group. All interventions were conducted 3 times a week (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday) for 8 weeks. Body mass, Lee's index and glucose infusion rate (GIR) were measured before and after the intervention. Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests (IPGTT) were conducted in the 6(th) week of the intervention period to test the blood glucose level. After the intervention, the percentages of Th17 and Treg cells in the adipose tissue were detected by flow cytometry and the Th17/Treg ratio was calculated, while the relative expression levels of SIRT1, acetylated nuclear factor-κB (AC-NF-κB), and interleukin-17 receptor A (IL-17A) proteins in the adipose tissue of rats in each group were analyzed by Western blot. RESULTS: Compared with the normal group, the model group showed increased body mass and Lee's index (P<0.05), elevated blood glucose level in IPGTT at all time pionts(P<0.05), decreased GIR (P<0.05), increased percentages of Th17 cells (P<0.05) and decreased percentages of Treg cells (P<0.05) in adipose tissue, and increased Th17/Treg ratio (P<0.05), the expression of SIRT1 protein was decreased (P<0.05) while the expression of Ac-NF-κB and IL-17A proteins were increased (P<0.05) in adipose tissue.

#7866,[Electroacupuncture alleviates ferroptosis in lung tissue by regulating Keap1/Nrf2 pathway in asthmatic mice],"OBJECTIVES: To observe the effect of electroacupuncture (EA) on the activities of Kelch-like epichlorohydrin-associated protein 1 (Keap1)/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway, pulmonary inflammation, and ferroptosis in house dust mite (HDM)-induced asthma model mice, so as to explore its underlying mechanisms in ameliorating asthma. METHODS: Female C57BL/6 mice were randomly allocated to 4 groups:control, model, EA, and dexamethasone (DEX) groups (n=6 per group). The asthma mouse model was established by repeated intranasal instillation of HDM 50 μg (in PBS) on day 0, 7 and 14 (for immunization), and 25 μg (in PBS) on day 21, 22 and 23 (for sensitization). EA (1 mA, 2 Hz/15 Hz) was applied to ""Dazhui"" (GV14), ""Feishu"" (BL13), and ""Zusanli"" (ST36) for 30 min, once every other day for 5 times. Mice of the DEX group received intraperitoneal injection of dexamethasone (1 mg/kg) once every other day for 5 times after modeling. The mice's general conditions were recorded and their asthma behavioral scores (0 to 9 points) were assessed according to the severity of symptoms of nasal grabbing, itch-scratching, and asthmatic attack. The mice's pulmonary function including forced expiratory volume in 0.1 second (FEV(0.1)), forced vital capacity (FVC), the ratio of FEV(0.1)/FVC, and peak expiratory flow (PEF) were measured using a pulmonary function detector. Additionally, the histopathological changes, inflammation scores and airway wall thickness (total bronchial wall area [Wat] / bronchial basement membrane perimeter [Pbm]) in the lung tissues were assessed using H.E. staining, periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining, and Masson staining, respectively. The contents of immunoglobulin E (IgE), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) in serum, interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), and iron in the serum and lung homogenates were detected using ELISA and bicinchoninic acid (BCA), separately. The protein and mRNA expression levels of Keap1, Nrf2, solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11), glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 4 (ACSL4), and transferrin receptor 1 (TFR1) in the lung tissue were detected by Western blot and PCR, separately. The positive expressions of SLC7A11, GPX4, ACSL4, and TFR1 in the lung tissue were detected using immunohistochemical staining. RESULTS: Compared to the control group, the asthma behavioral score, inflammation score, Wat/Pbm, contents of TNF-α, IgE, MDA and iron in the serum, contents of IL-1β and IL-6 in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and contents of MDA and iron in the lung tissue, expression levels of Keap1, ACSL4 and TFR1 proteins and mRNAs in the lung tissue, as well as the immunoactivity of pulmonary ACSL4 and TFR1 were significantly increased (P<0.01), while the FEV(0.1), ratio of FEV(0.1)/FVC, and the PEF, and serum and pulmonary GSH contents, expression levels of pulmonary Nrf2, SLC7A11 and GPX4 proteins and mRNAs, and immunoactivity of SLC7A11 and GPX4 significantly decreased in (P<0.01) the model group. In comparison with the model group, all the above indicators of mice in both EA and DEX groups were reversed (P<0.01, P<0.05). The therapeutic effects of EA were strikingly superior to those of DEX in raising PEF, and serum and pulmonary GSH (P<0.05, P<0.01), and in down-regulating serum IgE and iron, pulmonary iron, and expression levels of pulmonary ACSL4 mRNA (P<0.05, P<0.01), but striking inferior to those of DEX in raising expression levels of pulmonary Nrf2, SLC7A11 and GPX4 proteins and mRNAs, and SLC7A11 and GPX4 immunoactivity (P<0.05, P<0.01), and in lowering IL-6 of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, serum and pulmonary MDA contents, and the expression of pulmonary Keap1 protein and mRNA (P<0.05, P<0.01).

#7911,[Wheat-grain moxibustion combined with chemotherapy inhibits tumor growth by suppressing PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in breast cancer mice],"OBJECTIVES: To observe the effect of wheat-grain moxibustion plus chemotherapy on the activities of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling and expressions of Caspase-3 and Caspase-9 in mice with breast cancer, so as to explore its mechanisms underlying suppression of tumor growth. METHODS: Forty female BALB/c mice were randomly divided into blank control, model, chemotherapy, wheat-grain moxibustion (moxibustion) and moxibustion+chemotherapy groups, with 8 mice in each group. The breast cancer model was established by injection of 4T1 cell suspension (0.1 mL) into the subcutaneous fat pad of the mouse's right fourth nipple. After successful modeling, the mice of the chemotherapy group and moxibustion+chemotherapy group received injection of Adriamycin (2.5 mg/kg) into the mouse' leg or abdomen in the morning of Monday and Friday every week, 3 weeks altogether. For mice of the moxibustion and moxibustion+chemotherapy groups, wheat-grain moxibustion was applied to ""Shenque"" (CV8) and bilateral ""Zusanli"" (ST36) for 2 cones every time, once every other day for 21 days. The body weight, tumor weight and tumor volume were measured. The histopathological changes of the tumor were observed after H.E. staining. The terminal-deoxynucleoitidyl transferase mediated nick end labeling (TUNEL) was used to detect the apoptosis of tumor tissues in each group. The expression levels of PI3K, AKT, mTOR, phosphorylated (p)-PI3K, p-AKT, p-mTOR, Caspase-3, Cleaved Caspase-3, Caspase-9, and Cleaved Caspase-9 proteins in the tumor tissues were determined by Western blot. RESULTS: Compared with the model group, the body weight in the chemotherapy group, the tumor weight, tumor volume, and the expression ratios of p-PI3K/PI3K, p-AKT/AKT and p-mTOR/mTOR in the chemotherapy, moxibustion and moxibustion+chemotherapy groups were significantly decreased (P<0.05), while the apoptosis rate of tumor tissue, the expression levels of Caspase-3, cleaved Caspase-3, Caspase-9 and cleaved Caspase-9 proteins in the chemotherapy, moxibustion and moxibustion+chemotherapy groups were considerably increased (P<0.05). The therapeutic effect of moxibustion + chemotherapy was significantly superior to that of simple chemotherapy and simple moxibustion in reducing the tumor volume and tumor mass, and in down-regulating the expression ratio of p-AKT/AKT (P<0.05), and in up-regulating the apoptosis rate and the expression levels of Caspase-3 and cleaved Caspase-3 proteins (P<0.05), and superior to that of simple moxibustion (not the simple chemotherapy) in up-regulating the expression levels of Caspase-9 and cleaved Caspase 9 protein (P<0.05). The therapeutic effect of simple moxibustion was evidently inferior to that of simple chemotherapy in reducing tumor volume and tumor mass, in down-regulating the expression ratios of p-PI3K/PI3K and p-mTOR/mTOR (P<0.05), and in increasing the apoptosis rate, and expression of Caspase-3, Caspase-9 and cleaved Caspase-9 proteins (P<0.05). H.E. staining showed that the tumor cells of tumor tissue grew diffusely and arranged densely in the model group, while in the chemotherapy, moxibustion and moxibustion+chemotherapy groups, the tumor tissue showed light staining of cytoplasm and nucleus, reduced nuclear division, nuclear debris, smaller density, and different degrees of tumor cell necrosis, and the degree of necrosis was increased in the moxibustion group, chemotherapy group and moxibustion+ chemotherapy group. CONCLUSIONS: Moxibustion plus chemotherapy and simple moxibustion can inhibit tumor growth in breast cancer mice, which may be related to their functions in inhibiting the expression and phosphorylation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway related proteins in the tumor tissue, and then upregulating the expression of apoptosis related proteins Caspase-3 and Caspase-9.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#7928,Comparative study on curative effect and recurrence rate of chronic scapulohumeral periarthritis treated with different acupuncture techniques,"OBJECTIVES: To observe the effects of the local stimulation with 3 acupuncture techniques, i.e. Canggui Tanxue (needle insertion method like dark tortoise detecting point) technique, electroacupuncture (EA) and warm needling (WN) with filiform needles on shoulder pain, shoulder joint function, quality of life, inflammatory indicators and recurrence rate in the patients with chronic scapulohumeral periarthritis (CSP), so as to explore the optimal needling method of acupuncture for the predominant symptoms of CSP during the attack stage in the patients. METHODS: A total of 108 patients with CSP were randomly divided into a manual acupuncture (MA) group (36 cases, one case dropped off), a WN group (36 cases, 3 cases dropped off) and an EA group (36 cases, 1 case dropped off). In the three groups, Jianqian (EX-UE12), Jianyu (LI15), Jianzhen (SI9), Ashi (Extra) and Yanglingquan (GB34) on the affected side were selected. Canggui Tanxue needling technique, WN technique and EA were delivered in the MA group, the WN group and the EA group, respectively, 30 min each time, 3 times weekly for 4 weeks. The Neer test scores were compared；the visual analogue scale (VAS) was used to assess the degree of shoulder joint pain；the daily life activity abilities was evaluated using the activities of daily living (ADL) scale；the serum prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) content was measured using ELISA before and after treatment. The effectiveness rate and recurrence rate were calculated, and the occurrences of adverse reactions were recorded. RESULTS: Compared with the scores before treatment, the scores of pain, joint function, and range of motion as well as the total score of Neer test were all increased after treatment in the three groups (P<0.05)；the VAS score, ADL score and the content of serum PGE2 were decreased (P<0.05). After treatment, the pain score of Neer test in the EA group and the WN group were higher than those of the MA group (P<0.05), the joint function score of Neer test in the MA group and the WN group were higher than that of the EA group (P<0.05), and the range of motion score of Neer test in the MA group was higher when compared with the EA and WN groups (P<0.05). There was no statistical difference in the total score of Neer score among the three groups. VAS score in the EA group was lower than that of either the WN group or the MA group (P<0.05). ADL score in the MA group was lower compared with that of the WN group (P<0.05). PGE2 levels in both the WN group and the MA group were lower than that of the EA group (P<0.05). The total effective rate was 85.71% (30/35) in the MA group, 91.43% (32/35) in the EA group and 90.91% (30/33) in the WN group, there was no statistical differences among the three groups. At the end of the 6-month follow-up visit after treatment, there was no significant difference in the recurrence rate among three groups. No serious adverse reaction was found. CONCLUSIONS: In the treatment of CSP, the short-term effect is equivalent among EA, WN and MA. But, the analgesic effect is the best in the EA group, the treatment for anti-inflammation is the most effective in the MA and WN groups, and the needling technique of Canggui Tanxue in the MA group obtains the most favorable effect of releasing adhesion and recovering the range of motion in the shoulder joint.",No,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No,No,Yes,No
#7956,Tian jiu therapy for the treatment of asthma in adult patients: a meta-analysis,"OBJECTIVES: To review and evaluate the efficacy and safety of tian jiu therapy on san fu tian for adults with asthma. METHODS: A literature search through August 31, 2013, was done to identify comparative studies evaluating effective rate, pulmonary function, immune response, recurrence rate, quality of life, and adverse events. The Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMBASE, and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure were searched; only randomized controlled trials with treatment groups using tian jiu therapy were included. Cochrane Collaboration's risk of bias tool and Review Manager software, version 5.2, were used for the data synthesis. RESULTS: Six studies involving 657 patients were identified. tian jiu therapy was more effective than the control intervention (odds ratio [OR], 3.51; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.05-6.00; p<0.00001; I(2)=18%). The treatment group had a bigger decrease in IgE level (standard mean difference [SMD], -1.40; 95% CI, -2.18 to -0.63; p=0.0004; I(2)=85%) and Eosinophil (Eos) level (SMD, -4.26; 95% CI, -6.28 to -2.23; p<0.00001; I(2)=91%) compared with the control group. Included studies had a high risk of bias. Few adverse effects were reported in the included studies, and no serious adverse responses occurred. Adverse effects did not result in any dropouts. CONCLUSIONS: All studies indicated that tian jiu therapy has a positive effect on adults with asthma and that it is relatively safe because of its noninvasive nature. However, the limitations of the research design of the existing studies resulted in high risk of bias. More randomized controlled trials of better methodologic quality are needed to further confirm efficacy and safety of this therapy.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#7959,Pattern of corneal astigmatism induced by primary pterygium in patients with cataract in a secondary hospital in Southern China: a cross-sectional study,"OBJECTIVES: To review the pattern of primary pterygium-induced corneal astigmatism in patients with cataract in a southern Chinese population. DESIGN: Clinic-based cross-sectional retrospective study. SETTING: A secondary hospital at southern China. PARTICIPANTS: A group of 1689 eyes with primary pterygium (PT group) and the other group of 4062 eyes without pterygium (NPT group) were included. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Corneal power was measured by an autokeratorefractometer. Corneal astigmatism was calculated as the difference in corneal power between the steepest and flattest meridians. Distribution of corneal astigmatism was compared between eyes with pterygium and eyes without pterygium. RESULTS: Distribution of corneal astigmatism was different between PT group (skewness=2.548, kurtosis=8.237) and NPT group (skewness=2.778, kurtosis=15.52). Mean corneal astigmatism was significantly higher in the PT group (1.62±1.49D) compared with the NPT group (1.17±0.89D, p<0.0001). The prevalence of corneal astigmatism >1D (PT 52.3%, NPT 40.9%, p<0.0001), >2D (PT 22.4%, NPT 10.6%, p<0.0001) or >3D (PT 10.5%, NPT 3.2%, p<0.0001) was significantly higher in the PT group compared with the NPT group. Eyes in the PT group had significantly higher corneal astigmatism than the NPT group in almost every age group (all p<0.05), with the exception of patients ≥90 years. Moreover, eyes in the PT group had significantly higher with-the-rule (PT 1.72±1.59D, NPT 1.19±0.88D, p<0.0001) and against-the-rule (PT 1.63±1.46D, NPT 1.18±0.88D, p<0.0001) but similar oblique astigmatism (PT 1.11±1.00D, NPT 0.99±0.89D, p=0.065) corneal astigmatism compared with the NPT group. Power vector analysis indicated that the axis of corneal astigmatism was not significantly different between the two groups (J(0), PT -0.01±0.74D, NPT 0.01±0.52D, p=0.48; J(45), PT -0.03±0.82D, NPT 0.00±0.52D, p=0.54). CONCLUSIONS: Pattern of corneal astigmatism in eyes with cataract and coexisting primary pterygium was different from eyes without pterygium. Pterygium is associated with higher magnitude but not different axis of corneal astigmatism.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#7962,"Acupuncture treatment for pain: systematic review of randomised clinical trials with acupuncture, placebo acupuncture, and no acupuncture groups","OBJECTIVES: To study the analgesic effect of acupuncture and placebo acupuncture and to explore whether the type of the placebo acupuncture is associated with the estimated effect of acupuncture. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis of three armed randomised clinical trials. DATA SOURCES: Cochrane Library, Medline, Embase, Biological Abstracts, and PsycLIT. Data extraction and analysis Standardised mean differences from each trial were used to estimate the effect of acupuncture and placebo acupuncture. The different types of placebo acupuncture were ranked from 1 to 5 according to assessment of the possibility of a physiological effect, and this ranking was meta-regressed with the effect of acupuncture. DATA SYNTHESIS: Thirteen trials (3025 patients) involving a variety of pain conditions were eligible. The allocation of patients was adequately concealed in eight trials. The clinicians managing the acupuncture and placebo acupuncture treatments were not blinded in any of the trials. One clearly outlying trial (70 patients) was excluded. A small difference was found between acupuncture and placebo acupuncture: standardised mean difference -0.17 (95% confidence interval -0.26 to -0.08), corresponding to 4 mm (2 mm to 6 mm) on a 100 mm visual analogue scale. No statistically significant heterogeneity was present (P=0.10, I(2)=36%). A moderate difference was found between placebo acupuncture and no acupuncture: standardised mean difference -0.42 (-0.60 to -0.23). However, considerable heterogeneity (P<0.001, I(2)=66%) was also found, as large trials reported both small and large effects of placebo. No association was detected between the type of placebo acupuncture and the effect of acupuncture (P=0.60). CONCLUSIONS: A small analgesic effect of acupuncture was found, which seems to lack clinical relevance and cannot be clearly distinguished from bias. Whether needling at acupuncture points, or at any site, reduces pain independently of the psychological impact of the treatment ritual is unclear.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#7977,Electrical skin impedance at acupuncture points,"OBJECTIVES: To test whether electrical skin impedance at each of three acupuncture points (APs) is significantly lower than at nearby sites on the meridian (MP) and off the meridian (NP). DESIGN: Two instruments - Prognos (MedPrevent GmbH, Waldershof, Germany), a constant-current (DC) device, and PT Probe (designed for this study), a 100-Hz sinusoidal-current (AC) device-were used to record electrical impedance at three APs (right Gallbladder 14, right Pericardium 8, and left Triple Energizer 1), and two control sites for each AP. Each AP, MP, and NP was measured four times in random order with each device. SETTING: The study was conducted over a period of 4 days at the Oregon College of Oriental Medicine (OCOM). SUBJECTS: Twenty (20) healthy adults (14 women and 6 men), all recruited from the OCOM student body and faculty, participated in the study. RESULTS: The Prognos measurements had an intraclass correlation (ICC) = 0.84 and coefficient of variation (CV) = 0.43. The PT Probe had ICC = 0.81 and CV = 0.31. Impedance values at APs were not significantly less than at MPs or NPs. Impedance values at MPs were also not significantly less than NPs, although their individual p values were <0.05 in 4 of 6 cases. There was a significant trend of increasing impedance with repeated measurements with both the Prognos (p =0.003) and the PT Probe (p= 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Within the reliability limits of our study methods, none of the three APs tested has lower skin impedance than at either of the nearby control points. These results are not consistent with previous studies that detected lower skin impedance at APs than nearby sites. Further study is necessary to determine whether MPs have lower skin impedance than nearby NPs. Our study suggests caution is warranted when developing, using, and interpreting results from electrodermal screening devices. Further studies are needed to clarify the clinically important and controversial hypothesis that APs are sites of lower impedance.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No
#7983,Psychophysical and psychophysiological effects of heat stimulation by electric moxibustion,"OBJECTIVES: Traditional moxibustion might be not safe due to the excessive heat stimulation or toxic chemical components involved. Electric moxibustion (EM), which has been recently developed as an alternative, offers adjustable and constant heat stimulation. This study aimed to investigate the psychophysical and psychophysiological responses to EM heat stimulation. METHODS: Twenty-seven healthy volunteers received two different levels of heat stimulation using EM. High-temperature (HT) and medium-temperature (MT) heat stimulations were randomly delivered at the TE5 acupoint on the left or right arm. Participants rated the intensity and the spatial information of the heat sensations immediately after each EM stimulation. Local blood flow around the acupoint was measured with Laser Doppler perfusion imaging before and after heat stimulation. RESULTS: Both HT-EM and MT-EM induced considerable heat sensations and enhanced local blood flow around the acupoints. HT-EM resulted in greater heat sensation compared to MT-EM. HT-EM induced a higher increase in local blood flow around the stimulation site compared to MT-EM. No remarkable adverse effects were noted. CONCLUSION: Two different levels of EM heat stimulation induced two different levels of heat sensations and enhanced local blood flow. This preliminary study suggests that the newly developed EM can be further applied to examine the effectiveness of moxibustion in clinical trials.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#7984,The combined effect of relaxation response and acupuncture on quality of life in patients with HIV: a pilot study,"OBJECTIVES: Treatment advances have transformed human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) into a chronic manageable disease; quality of life (QoL) has become an important health outcome. Some studies have shown the individual effects of acupuncture and the relaxation response (RR) in improving QoL of patients with HIV/AIDS. In light of the presumed shared features of acupuncture and the RR, we conducted a pilot study to examine the effects of adding the RR to usual acupuncture treatment on improving the QoL of HIV/AIDS patients. DESIGN: Two-arm double-blind randomized controlled trial. SETTINGS/LOCATION AND SUBJECTS: We enrolled 119 patients with HIV/AIDS (mean age 46 years, 85% male) who had at least 1 of the highly prevalent HIV-related symptoms and who were receiving acupuncture treatment in an acupuncture clinic in Boston, MA. INTERVENTION: We randomized patients into intervention (N = 58) and control (N = 61) groups. All participants received individualized acupuncture treatments prescribed by their acupuncturists. While receiving acupuncture treatment, the intervention group wore earphones to listen to tapes with instructions to elicit the RR followed by soft music that was routinely played in the clinic; the control group listened only to soft music. OUTCOME MEASURES: Three (3) QoL scales: the Medical Outcomes Study HIV health survey, the Functional Assessment of HIV Infection, and the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Spiritual Well-Being, measured at baseline, 4-week, 8-week, and 12-week follow-ups. RESULTS: At the 12-week follow-up, the intervention group showed significant improvements in emotional (p = 0.0002), spiritual/peace (p = 0.02), physical (p = 0.003) and mental health (p = 0.0003) QoL from baseline. Results of mixed effects regression models indicated linear trends of improvement over time in these dimensions of QoL for the intervention group (p < 0.02). In the control group, the only significant improvement was observed in the emotional QoL (p < 0.01). The intervention group showed trends of greater improvements than the control group (p = 0.07 for 12-week physical health QoL). CONCLUSIONS: Data from this pilot trial suggested that adding the RR to acupuncture may enhance improvement in QoL of patients with HIV/AIDS. Further investigation on this putative synergistic effect is warranted.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes
#8010,"[Effects of chronoacupuncture na ja fa on gastric acid secretion, plasma gastrin and prostaglandin E1 in patients with peptic ulcer]","Observations on gastric acid secretion, plasma gastrin and prostaglandin E1 in patients with peptic ulcer disease were made after giving acupuncture with Na Ja Fa. The relationship between the chosen points and their effects was also discussed so as to provide more evidence to evaluate and practice the traditional chronoacupuncture more accurately. The results of this experiment were: (1) The gastric acid output of patients with peptic ulcer disease was decreased, while the plasma gastrin and prostaglandin E1 were increased after puncturing with Na Ja Fa. This reveals that the decrease of acid output was not caused by the change of plasma gastrin, however the plasma prostaglandin E1 may be involved in this process. (2) By using points on Stomach and Spleen meridians, there was a better inhibiting effect in acid output than treating the points of other meridians. This showed that using chronoacupuncture should include choosing points according to differentiation and only by laying stress on the relative specialization of the actions of these points one could expect improvement in efficiency. (3) There were no obvious differences between the standard opening points and the group of points which changed to opening points by Dr Shan Yu Tang. This proves that these two groups of points do have some similar functions and are both effective for clinical use.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,Yes
#8013,Addressing Occupational Back Pain: A Systematic Review of Preventive and Therapeutic Strategies,"Occupational back pain has emerged as a significant public health concern. Despite several efforts to mitigate the adverse effects of occupational back pain, this issue still persists across the globe. This systematic review summarizes the preventive and therapeutic options available for managing occupational back pain. A systemic search was carried out in various databases including PubMed, Web of Science, CINAHL Ultimate, and Scopus to identify relevant literature. The search was also extended to Google Scholar to identify more relevant studies. A combination of keywords was used during the search. Studies were included if they focused on occupational back pain, investigated preventive and treatment options, and were published in English. A total of 20 relevant studies, including 62,176 participants, were included in this systemic review. Out of these 20 studies, 10 were randomized control trials, four were cross-sectional studies, two were longitudinal studies, one was a single-blinded clinical study, two were prospective studies, and the remaining one was a pilot study. This systemic review identified various interventions to improve occupational back pain. The common therapeutic strategies included educational programs, physio and rehab interventions, acupuncture, mixed treatment strategies, reflexology, massage, yoga, active physical therapy, and real-time occupational internet-based interventions. Some studies also reported the effectiveness of opioid therapy and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for managing back pain. Findings indicated that these therapies effectively reduced occupational back pain and improved quality of life. However, opioid therapy uses also raised safety concerns. The findings of this systemic review highlight the importance of adopting evidence-based strategies to address occupational back pain effectively.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#8016,Efficacy and safety of acupuncture for the treatment of oligoasthenozoospermia: A systematic review,"Oligoasthenozoospermia is a common factor leading to male infertility. Acupuncture has been applied for treating male infertility for several thousand years in China, but clinical evidence of its efficacy and safety in treating oligoasthenozoospermia is yet to be established. This review aimed to systematically assess the evidence on the effect of acupuncture in males with oligoasthenozoospermia. Databases (PubMed, EMBASE, SINOMED, CNKI, Wanfang database and Cochrane Library) were searched to identify related studies published before 30th June 2019. The Cochrane risk of bias tool and Jadad score was adopted to assess the methodological quality of included studies. Twelve randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with 1,088 participants were included in this review. The aim of this study was to perform a meta-analysis, but it was not possible due to considerable clinical heterogeneity among the included studies. According to the narrative analysis, acupuncture or acupuncture combined with another intervention was effective in improving the semen quality based on the included studies. However, this result should be interpreted with caution due to high risk. The methodological quality of most included studies was low. The current evidence on acupuncture for oligoasthenozoospermia is inadequate to draw a solid conclusion due to the poor methodological quality. Rigorous full-scale RCTs are needed to validate the therapeutic efficacy and safety of acupuncture in treating oligoasthenozoospermia.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No

There is significant interest in the West in using components of Chinese medicine (CM) -such as botanicals and herbal medicines, acupuncture and acupressure, and qigong-in the field of oncology, as potential anticancer agents, for symptom management, and to improve quality of life. The proposal for a consortium on CM came from the Chinese Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, with the aims of improving scientific communications and collaborations and modernizing the studies of CM for cancer. The US National Cancer Institute's Office of Cancer Complementary and Alternative Medicine agreed to work with Chinese Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences to explore the feasibility of establishing an international consortium for Chinese medicine and cancer. At the meeting, participants from the United States, China, Canada, Australia, and Korea discussed issues in CM and cancer research, treatment, and management, including potential mechanisms of action, proof of efficacy, adverse effects, regulatory issues, and the need for improving the quality of randomized clinical trials of CM treatments and supportive care interventions.

#8041,Could neuroimaging help us to interpret the clinical effects of acupuncture?,"One of the problems in assessing acupuncture efficacy has been the lack of a standardised placebo/control. Despite the lack of 'proof', acupuncture is widely used; hence it would seem that a large proportion of the public are not too concerned with the question of efficacy. Patients and researchers approach the issue of whether acupuncture ""works"" in an entirely different way. It may be that the management of chronic pain as a whole is largely context driven and non-specific. Therefore, research should focus on areas such as pragmatic/comparative trials and the non-specific effects of treatment. Improving our understanding of the neural mechanisms and substrates of acupuncture, placebo and non-specific effects might enable us to better define a ""true placebo"" and improve trial design. Imaging studies, however, need to be much more pragmatic. Because of the large overlap in areas of brain activated through acupuncture, pain, placebo and non-specific factors, separating these out in an attempt to pinpoint the mechanisms behind acupuncture will be difficult. Ultimately we need a balance between efficacy, comparative and mechanistic trials using imaging work to inform the whole picture. A broader view of research is therefore necessary to yield meaningful answers and we need to look at the whole package that acupuncture delivers.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#8050,Directional acuity for drifting plaids,"Orientation discrimination thresholds were estimated for symmetrical ""plaids"", constructed by the super-imposition of two, independent drifting sine-wave gratings of 2.5 c/deg. Experiments were conducted when the apparent direction of drift was on the two principal meridians (vertical and horizontal), and when the apparent direction of drift was at the two oblique orientations (45 and 135 deg). Acuity for the direction of drift for these stimuli is of the same order of precision as orientation acuity for static or drifting gratings, and exhibits a meridional anisotropy that favours the principal meridians. This anisotropy follows a pattern that is determined by the apparent direction of drift, and not the orientation of the underlying elements. Acuity for orientation is lowest for oblique drift directions, even though both of the elements are oriented on the principal meridians. This finding was confirmed when the orientation of the underlying elements was subject to a random variation. The results are not easily accommodated by models that propose that the individual elements of the plaid are analysed separately. Second, the data are incompatible with models of the oblique effect of orientation discrimination that are based on an axis dependent, differential sampling of the retinal image.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#8064,Pressure on acupoints decreases postoperative pain,"Our objective was to study the analgesic effect of acupoint pressure on postoperative pain in a controlled single-blind study. Forty patients undergoing knee arthroscopy in an ambulatory surgery unit in a university-affiliated hospital were randomized to receive either an active stimulation (AS) or a placebo stimulation (PS) 30 min after awakening from anesthesia. We stimulated 15 classical acupoints in the AS group, on the side contralateral to surgery, with a firm pressure and a gliding movement across the acupoint. In the PS group, 15 nonacupoints were subjected to light pressure in the same areas as the acupoints in the AS group. We assessed pain using a 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS) before sensory stimulation, after 30 and 60 min, and after 24 h. We recorded heart rate, systolic arterial pressure, and skin temperature before stimulation and after 30 and 60 min. We assessed skin blood flow with laser Doppler before stimulation and after 1 and 30 min. Sixty minutes and 24 h after AS, VAS pain scores were lower than in the placebo group (p < 0.05 and 0.0001, respectively). There were no significant changes in the autonomic variables. The results indicate that pressure on acupoints can decrease postoperative pain.",No,No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No
#8086,Acupuncture Relieves Stress-Induced Depressive Behavior by Reducing Oxidative Stress and Neuroapoptosis in Rats,"Oxidative stress is closely related to the occurrence of depression. Acupuncture has been proved to be an effective method for treating depression. In order to explore the mechanism of the antidepressant effect of acupuncture, this study performed acupuncture prevention on chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) depression model rats, and observed the effect of acupuncture on hippocampal oxidative stress and Nrf2 signaling pathway. Male SD rats were randomly divided into control group, CUMS group, acupuncture group, and fluoxetine group (n = 10/group). Fluoxetine, a common antidepressant, was used as a positive control drug in this study. In the fluoxetine group, rats were given fluoxetine (2.1 mg/kg) intragastrically once a day for 28 days. The acupoints of Shangxing (GV23) and Fengfu (GV16) were applied in acupuncture group, once every other day for 14 times in total. Behavioral tests and biological detections were used to evaluate the effects of the interventions and the changes of factors related to oxidative stress, Nrf2 pathway, and neuronal apoptosis. The results showed that both acupuncture and fluoxetine could increase sugar preference rate in SPT and decrease immobility time in FST in depression model rats. It also significantly decreased oxidative stress products such as ROS and H(2)O(2), and elevated the protein and mRNA expressions of Nrf2 and HO-1. From Nissl's staining, there were more abundant nerve cells in two intervention groups compared with CUMS group. Plus, acupuncture down-regulated the expression levels of Bax and caspase-3 and up-regulated the expression of Bcl-2. Our findings indicate that acupuncture improved depression-like behaviors of CUMS rats. And CUMS-induced depression-like behaviors in rats were related to oxidative stress and neuronal apoptosis in hippocampus. Acupuncture showed antidepressant effects in reducing oxidative stress products via regulating the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway so that prevented neuronal apoptosis.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#8092,"Effectiveness and Therapeutic Mechanism of Pharmacopuncture for Pain in Parkinson's Disease: A Study Protocol for a Pilot Pragmatic Randomized, Assessor-Blinded, Usual Care-Controlled, Three-Arm Parallel Trial","Pain in Parkinson's disease (PD) represents a complex phenotype known to decrease quality of life. This pragmatic randomized, controlled clinical trial evaluated the efficacy of pharmacopuncture (PA) for improving pain symptoms and investigated the corresponding therapeutic mechanisms in patients with PD. Ninety patients with PD-related pain were randomly allocated to receive either PA, manual acupuncture, or usual care in a 1:1:1 ratio; sixty healthy controls were included for comparative analysis of brain imaging data. Over 12 weeks, study treatment provided 2 days per week for 8 weeks with a follow-up period of 4 weeks. The primary outcome measure was the King's Parkinson's Disease Pain Scale score for assessing improvement in PD-related pain, including a sub-analysis to investigate the pattern of changes in pain according to a PD-related pain mechanism-based classification. Secondary outcome measures included a numerical rating scale-based assessment of the intensity and location of pain and changes in pain-associated symptoms, such as depression, anxiety, and sleep disorders. Exploratory outcome measures included structural and functional brain patterns on magnetic resonance imaging, blood molecular signature changes, gait analysis, facial expression and movement assessment in response to emotional stimuli, and a traditional Korean medicine syndrome differentiation questionnaire. The trial findings provided important clinical evidence for the effectiveness of PA in the management of PD-related pain and its associated symptoms, and helped elucidate the mechanism of its therapeutic effect on PD-related pain.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#8095,Battlefield Acupuncture for Adult Pain: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials,"Pain is a major public health problem, causing heavy social and economic burdens to patients and society while consuming tremendous medical resources at the same time. Thus, there is a critical need to find low-cost, efficacious, and therapeutic approaches to help manage pain. While acupuncture is increasingly recognized as a promising pain-relieving method, less is known about a specific form of auricular acupuncture known as Battlefield Acupuncture (BFA). The BFA technique involves the sequential placement of semi-permanent, single-use, French ASP[Formula: see text] golden needles to five specific acupoints in one or both ears, where they are left in place for 3-4 days or longer [Niemtzow, R.C., Battlefield acupuncture. Med. Acupunct. 19: 225-228, 2007]. The BFA needles (more accurately described as tiny conical darts) pierce the ear in designated locations in a particular order [Levy, C.E., N. Casler and D.B. FitzGerald. Battlefield acupuncture: an emerging method for easing pain. Am. J. Phys. Med. Rehabil. 97: e18-e19, 2018.]. (Figs. 4 and 5) It was developed by Dr. Richard C. Niemtzow in 2001, as a subgroup form of an auricular acupuncture technique based on the somatotopic arrangement of an inverted fetus pattern on the external ear [Romoli, M. Ear acupuncture: historical abstract-differences of ear cartography between the east and the west. Dtsch. Z. Akupunkt. 53: 24-33, 2010.]. Currently, BFA is widely used in the US military, but to our knowledge, there is no review which comprehensively synthesizes the current publications surrounding pain management. This review aims to investigate the effects and safety of BFA in adults with pain. Electronic databases were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in English evaluating efficacy and safety of BFA in adults with pain, from database inception to September 6, 2019. The primary outcome was pain intensity change, and the secondary outcome was safety. Nine RCTs were included in this review, and five trials involving 344 participants were analyzed quantitatively. Compared with no intervention, usual care, sham BFA, and delayed BFA interventions, BFA had no significant improvement in the pain intensity felt by adults suffering from pain. Few adverse effects (AEs) were reported with BFA therapy, but they were mild and transitory. BFA is a safe, rapid, and easily learned acupuncture technique, mainly used in acute pain management, but no significant efficacy was found in adult individuals with pain, compared with the control groups. Given the poor methodological quality of the included studies, high-quality RCTs with rigorous evaluation methods are needed in the future.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#8097,Autonomic status and pain profile in patients of chronic low back pain and following electro acupuncture therapy: a randomized control trial,"Pain is a syndrome characterized by several neurophysiological changes including that of the autonomic nervous system. Chronic low back pain (LBP) is a major health problem and is a frequent reason for using unconventional therapies especially acupuncture. This study was conducted to evaluate the autonomic status and pain profile in chronic LBP patients and to observe the effect of electro acupuncture therapy. Chronic LBP patients (n=60) were recruited from the Department of Orthopaedics, GTB Hospital, Delhi. Age and sex matched healthy volunteers were selected as controls (n=30). Following a written consent, LBP patients were randomly allocated into two study groups - Group A received 10 sittings of electro acupuncture, on alternate days, at GB and UB points selected for back pain, while the Group B received a conventional drug therapy in the form of oral Valdecoxib together with supervised physiotherapy. Controls were assessed once while the patients were assessed twice, before and after completion of the treatment program (3 weeks). The autonomic status was studied with non-invasive cardiovascular autonomic function tests which included E: I ratio, 30:15 ratio, postural challenge test and sustained handgrip test. Pain intensity was measured with the visual analogue scale (VAS) and the global perceived effect (GPE). Statistical analysis was performed using repeated measure's ANOVA with Tukey's test. Pain patients showed a significantly reduced vagal tone and increased sympathetic activity as compared to the controls (P<0.05 to P<0.001 in different variables). Following treatment, both the study groups showed a reduction in vagal tone together with a decrease in the sympathetic activity. There was also a considerable relief of pain in both groups, however, the acupuncture group showed a better response (P<0.01). We conclude that there is autonomic dysfunction in chronic LBP patients. Acupuncture effectively relieves the pain and improves the autonomic status and hence can be used as an alternative/additive treatment modality in these cases.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes
#8101,Integrative Medicine Therapies for Pain Management in Cancer Patients,"Pain management for cancer patients should include pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions. Integrative medicine therapies, such as mind-body practice, acupuncture, massage therapy, and music therapy, have been studied for their roles in pain management. Data from randomized controlled trials support the effect of hypnosis, acupuncture, and music therapy in reduction of pain. Mindfulness meditation, yoga, qigong, and massage therapy, although may not reduce pain per se, can relieve anxiety and mood changes, which are commonly associated with pain. In clinical practice, one should also consider burdens and risks to patients, patient preference, and the presence or absence of better alternatives when making decisions on whether an integrative medicine therapy is of clinical value.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#8106,Effects of acupuncture on radial artery hemodynamics: controlled trials in sensitized and naive subjects,"Palpation of the radial pulses is an important technique in traditional Chinese medicine. Two double-blind randomized trials of the effects of real and sham acupuncture on radial artery hemodynamics were conducted in 19 patients regularly exposed to acupuncture (sensitized subjects) and in 8 healthy subjects devoid of previous exposure (naive subjects), respectively. Radial artery diameter and pulse waveform were measured with a high-resolution echotracking system and aplanation tonometry, respectively, before and during a 20-min acupuncture period. In sensitized patients, arterial diameter significantly increased during real acupuncture, compared with the sham group (+7.5 +/- 2.8 vs. -2.9 +/- 2.7%, respectively; P < 0.01). By contrast, in naive subjects, arterial diameter did not change during real or sham acupuncture. In both populations, no significant difference was observed between real and sham acupuncture, concerning the time course of blood pressure, radial artery distensibility, and pressure waveform. Our results demonstrate that real acupuncture is associated with an objective vasodilatation of the radial artery in patients regularly exposed to acupuncture, but not in naive subjects.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes
#8121,Complementary and Alternative Medicines Used by Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Diseases,"Patients and physicians often have many questions regarding the role of complementary and alternative medicines (CAMs), or nonallopathic therapies, for inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). CAMs of various forms are used by more than half of patients with IBD during some point in their disease course. We summarize the available evidence for the most commonly used and discussed CAMs. We discuss evidence for the effects of herbs (such as cannabis and curcumin), probiotics, acupuncture, exercise, and mind-body therapy. There have been few controlled studies of these therapies, which have been limited by their small sample sizes; most studies have been uncontrolled. In addition, there has been a lack of quality control for herbal preparations. It has been a challenge to design rigorous, randomized, placebo-controlled trials, in part owing to problems of adequate blinding for psychological interventions, acupuncture, and exercise. These barriers have limited the acceptance of CAMs by physicians. However, such therapies might be used to supplement conventional therapies and help ease patient symptoms. We conclude that physicians should understand the nature of and evidence for CAMs for IBD so that rational advice can be offered to patients who inquire about their use. CAMs have the potential to aid in the treatment of IBD, but further research is needed to validate these approaches.",Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#8138,Efficacy of Acupuncture for Insomnia: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Patients with insomnia frequently use acupuncture as an alternative treatment to pharmacotherapy globally. The aim of this paper is to assess the effect of acupuncture on insomnia. Seven medical databases, including MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, CNKI, RISS, NDSL, and OASIS, were used to identify studies published through July 09, 2020. Twenty-four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included in this qualitative review comparing acupuncture to either pharmacotherapy or sham-acupuncture therapy. Methodological quality was assessed, using the Cochrane risk of bias (ROB). In the subsequent quantitative meta-analysis of studies comparing acupuncture versus pharmacotherapy, fifteen RCTs demonstrated that acupuncture had a significant effect on patients with insomnia as assessed by the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) (RR: -0.74; 95% CI: -1.07 to -0.40; [Formula: see text] ¡0.0001; [Formula: see text] = 89%; [Formula: see text] = 1475). A subgroup analysis showed that there was no significant effect after weeks 1 and 2, but six studies found that acupuncture had a significant effect insomnia at week 3 (RR: -0.97; 95% CI: -1.65 to -0.28; [Formula: see text] = 0.006; [Formula: see text] = 91%; [Formula: see text] = 463) and nine studies demonstrated a significant effect at week 4 (RR: -0.70; 95% CI: -1.15 to -0.25; [Formula: see text] = 0.002; [Formula: see text] = 85%; [Formula: see text] = 594). These results suggest that insomnia patients may experience significant improvement in symptoms after more than three weeks of acupuncture treatment compared to pharmacological treatments.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,No
#8139,Effectiveness of Acupuncture on Health-Related Quality of Life in Patients Receiving Maintenance Hemodialysis,"Patients with kidney failure (KF) receiving maintenance hemodialysis (HD) experience numerous symptoms that impair their health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and contribute to high mortality rates. Acupuncture is often used for symptom enhancement and HRQOL. This blinded, randomized, controlled patient-assessor trial evaluated the effectiveness of acupuncture compared with sham acupuncture on patients' HRQOL receiving maintenance HD as a secondary analysis. Seventy-two participants were randomly assigned to verum acupuncture (VA), sham acupuncture (SA), or waiting-list (WL) groups. The outcome was an improvement in HRQOL, assessed using the Kidney Disease Quality of Life-Short Form, version 1.3 (KDQOL-SF™ v1.3) at baseline, after treatment, and at 12-week follow-up. Non-parametric tests were used for statistical analysis. Of the 72 randomized patients, 67 were included in the complete analysis set. As for the changes between baseline and after treatment, the VA group showed significantly increased scores on most of the KDQOL-SF™ v1.3 scales compared to SA or WL groups (p < 0.05). No statistically significant differences between groups were observed in the changes from baseline to follow-up (p > 0.05). Compared to the sham treatment, acupuncture improved the HRQOL in patients receiving maintenance HD after treatment but not at follow-up.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes
#8158,Use of acupuncture in the management of chronic haemophilia pain,"Persons with haemophilia experience persistent pain resulting in chronic arthritic symptoms. The older person with haemophilia who did not benefit from primary prophylaxis are particularly at risk for persistent pain in multiple target joints as a result of repeated joint bleeding with delayed treatment received. The National Pain Study, Ref. [11] identified over 700 persons with haemophilia who rated daily persistent pain as 4.22/10 (SD ± 2.05) using a visual analogue scale. The study suggests that persons are continually seeking additional resources to relieve pain. This study seeks to identify: (i) effects of acupuncture use for persons with haemophilia who experience persistent joint pain as a result of repeated haemarthrosis and (ii) document no reported increased bleeding risk as a result of acupuncture use. End points include the subjects reported perception of reduction in pain via the 10-point visual analogue pain scale and bleeding. Nine subjects participated in the study, some who received a factor replacement to 15% correction and others who did not receive factor prior to any acupuncture sessions totaling 14 acupuncture treatments. No one of the subjects experienced bleeding or bruising. Six of the nine subjects reported an improvement in pain scores by at least 50%. Seven of the nine quality of life (QOL) domains within the QOL SF-36 questionnaire improved, suggesting a perception by subjects of improvement. This study suggests that acupuncture therapy can be a safe additional modality for pain management therapies in persons with haemophilia, although larger randomized studies are needed for further validation.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No
#8166,Scotopic sensitivity loss in glaucoma,"Photopic and scotopic increment thresholds were measured at selected visual field positions for 39 patients suspected of having glaucoma, 39 patients with diagnosed glaucoma, and 31 age-matched normal control subjects. Stimuli were presented at equal-eccentricity pairs of positions just above and below the nasal horizontal meridian. Both photopic and scotopic thresholds were elevated significantly for both the suspect and glaucoma groups. The average photopic and scotopic threshold elevations were the same for the suspect group, but scotopic threshold elevations were substantially greater than photopic threshold elevations for the glaucoma group. In a more detailed analysis of the glaucoma group data, local and diffuse components of the photopic and scotopic threshold elevations were operationally defined. The analysis revealed that localized photopic and scotopic scotomas were of equal depth, but diffuse scotopic defects exceeded diffuse photopic defects by a factor of 2:1 log units. These findings suggest that not all ganglion cell types are equally susceptible to glaucomatous damage and also point to scotopic perimetry as a potentially sensitive test for early glaucoma detection.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#8168,Distal traditional acupuncture points of the large intestinal meridian and the stomach meridian differently affect heart rate variability and oxygenation of the trapezius muscle,"Physicians in traditional Chinese medicine have found that acupoints and meridians have effects on specific parts of the body. The aim of this study was to see how acupressure at distal acupuncture points of a specific meridian affects heart rate variability (HRV) and oxygenation of the trapezius muscle. Forty-one female participants were randomly allocated to three groups. Subjects in the Stomach Meridian acupuncture point (ST) group received acupressure at ST 34, ST 36, and ST 41, subjects in the Large Intestinal Meridian acupuncture point (LI) group received acupressure at LI 4, LI 10, and LI 11, and subjects in the control group did not receive any stimuli. HRV and oxygenation of the trapezius muscles were measured. The high frequency components of HRV in the control and LI groups tended to be higher than those in the ST group. Total hemoglobin in the control and LI groups eventually reached significantly higher levels than in the ST group. While oxyhemoglobin (ΔO2Hb) in the control and LI groups did not change, ΔO2Hb in the ST significantly decreased temporarily.",No,No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No
#8203,The effect of acupressure on nausea and vomiting after cesarean section under spinal anesthesia,"Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is one of the most common postoperative complications. Aside from pharmacological interventions, other complementary healing modalities have been introduced to assist patients in decreasing PONV and improving postoperative outcomes. This study examined acupressure as a safe complement to the more traditional approach of using drugs to prevent and/or relieve nausea and vomiting in the Cesarean section (C/S) under spinal anesthesia. In a prospective randomized clinical trial, 152 patients who were candidate for elective C/S under spinal anesthesia were evaluated in two groups (acupressure vs control groups). Subjects in the acupressure group received constant pressure by a specific wrist elastic band (without puncture of the skin) on the Nei-Guan acupuncture point, 30 min prior to spinal anesthesia. The incidence of PONV was assessed during the surgery, at recovery room and at 1st, 2nd and 3rd two hours after the surgery. Significant differences in the incidence of the post-operative nausea and vomiting were found between the acupressure and control groups, with a reduction in the incidence rate of nausea from 35.5% to 13.2%. The amount of vomitus and the degree of discomfort were, respectively, less and lower in the study group. In view of the total absence of side-effects in acupressure, its application is worthy. Our study confirmed the effectiveness of acupressure in preventing post-operative nausea and vomiting, when applied 30 minutes prior to surgery.",No,No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No
#8205,Acupressure treatment for prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting,"Postoperative nausea and vomiting are still common problems after general anesthesia, especially in ambulatory surgery. Drug therapy is often complicated with central nervous system symptoms. We studied a nonpharmacological method of therapy--acupressure--at the Pericardium 6 (P.6) (Nei-Guan) meridian point. Two hundred consecutive healthy patients undergoing a variety of short surgical procedures were included in a randomized, double-blind study: 108 patients were in the acupressure group (Group 1) and 92 patients were in the control group (Group 2). Spherical beads of acupressure bands were placed at the P.6 points in the anterior surface of both forearms in Group 1 patients, while in Group 2 they were placed inappropriately on the posterior surface. The acupressure bands were placed before induction of anesthesia and were removed 6 h postoperatively. They were covered with a soft cotton wrapping to conceal them from the blinded observer who evaluated the patients for presence of nausea and vomiting and checked the order sheet for any antiemetics prescribed. In both groups, the age, gender, height, weight, and type and duration of surgical procedures were all comparable without significant statistical difference. In Group 1, only 25 of 108 patients (23%) had nausea and vomiting as compared to Group 2, in which 38 of 92 patients (41%) had nausea and vomiting (P = 0.0058). We concluded that acupressure at the P.6 (Nei-Guan) point is an effective prophylaxis for postsurgical nausea and vomiting and therefore a good alternative to conventional antiemetic treatment.",No,No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No
#8211,Comparison of P6 acupoint injection with 50% glucose in water and intravenous droperidol for prevention of vomiting after gynecological laparoscopy,"Postoperative vomiting causes patients distress and delays discharge after outpatient surgery. Although P6 electroacupuncture is recognized as having an antiemetic effect, its inconvenient instrumentation may limit its clinical applicability. The purpose of this study was to explore a simple and effective alternative method for control of postoperative vomiting in outpatient surgery. We prospectively compared the effect of P6 acupoint injection with 0.2 ml 50% glucose in water (G/W) and intravenous injection of 20 micrograms/kg droperidol for prevention of vomiting in 120 consecutive outpatients undergoing gynecological laparoscopy with general anesthesia. Patients were randomly allocated to receive P6 acupoint injection, i.v. droperidol, or nothing as control group. Both P6 acupoint injection and i.v. droperidol 20 micrograms/kg were found to have a significant antiemetic effect when compared with the control group. We conclude that P6 acupoint injection with 50% G/W is a simple and effective method for reducing the incidence of postoperative emesis in outpatient surgery.",No,No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No
#8224,Chronic bronchitis in the 1990s: up-to-date treatment,"Prevention is the key to eradicating chronic bronchitis. Smoking is the prime factor involved. Quitting smoking is difficult even with modern aids such as counselling, filters, substitutes, hypnosis and acupuncture, and the success rate is only 20%. Passive smoking is also injurious. The role of atmospheric pollution is less well quantified. Other risk factors include lower social class, occupation, area of residence, housing, temperature, and childhood respiratory illness. Influenza vaccination gives 60-70% immunity. With exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, beta-lactamase-producing bacteria are important, though the overall need for antibiotics is uncertain judging by placebo-controlled studies. Inhaled beta 2-agonist bronchodilators may improve airflow obstruction, as may anticholinergic drugs (e.g. ipratropium), the two being additive. Oral theophyllines have a narrow therapeutic window, serious side-effects and only two thirds of the effect of beta 2-agonists. A corticosteroid trial for 2 weeks may relieve refractory airway obstruction in 17-23% of chronic bronchitis, to be followed by inhaled steroids. Mucolytic drugs remain controversial and are difficult to monitor successfully. Oxygen therapy may be indicated for hypoxic chronic bronchitis, including long-term usage in cor pulmonale. Pulmonary rehabilitation by exercise training has recently been appreciated, and may be used in combination with the above treatment modalities.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#8232,Moxibustion and Acupuncture Ameliorate Crohn's Disease by Regulating the Balance between Th17 and Treg Cells in the Intestinal Mucosa,"Previous studies have demonstrated that acupuncture is beneficial to patients with Crohn's disease (CD), but the mechanism underlying its therapeutic effects remains unclear. To identify the mechanism by which acupuncture treats CD, the balance between Th17 and Treg cells was assessed in CD patients. In this study, Ninety-two CD patients were randomly and equally assigned to a treatment group that were treated with herb-partitioned moxibustion and acupuncture or a control group with wheat bran-partitioned moxibustion and superficial acupuncture. The effect of these treatments on Th17 and Treg cells and their related molecular markers in the intestinal mucosa were detected before (week 0) and after (week 12) treatment. The results suggested that the ratio of Th17 and Treg cells was significantly decreased after treatment and that the levels of IL-17 and RORγt in the intestinal mucosa were obviously reduced, while the expression of FOXP3 was increased after treatment in both groups. In the treatment group, the expression of these molecules was more markedly regulated than the control group. In conclusion, moxibustion and acupuncture have been shown to regulate the ratio of Th17 and Treg cells in the intestinal mucosa of CD patients and restore the balance between these immune cell subsets.",No,No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No
#8247,Immediate Analgesic Effect of Acupuncture in Patients With Primary Dysmenorrhea: A fMRI Study,"Primary dysmenorrhea (PDM) is a common gynecological disease characterized by lower abdominal pain. Acupuncture is considered a good alternative therapy for PDM. However, the central mechanism of the analgesic effect of acupuncture is largely unknown. In this study, eligible patients were randomized into the real and sham acupuncture groups using a computer-generated, permuted block randomization method. The study cohort comprised 34 patients: 19 in the real acupuncture group and 15 in the sham acupuncture group. The clinical characteristics of the patients during their menstrual period were collected, and imaging scans were performed during the first 3 days of the patients' menstrual period. We analyzed task and resting functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data to investigate the potential central mechanism of the immediate effect of acupuncture intervention on the intensity of PDM pain. The task fMRI study found that the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) and right supplemental motor area were activated during real acupuncture. Using the resting-state functional connectivity (FC) method, we found a post- versus pre-treatment change in the FC of the rACC and left precentral gyrus in the comparison of real acupuncture versus sham acupuncture. In addition, the FC of the rACC-left precentral gyrus at baseline was negatively correlated with short-term analgesia, while the change in the FC of the rACC-left precentral gyrus was positively correlated with short-term analgesia after acupuncture treatment. These findings support the importance of rACC-left precentral gyrus resting-state FC in the modulation of the intensity of PDM pain through acupuncture, which may shed light on the central mechanism of acupuncture in the treatment of PDM.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,Yes
#8255,Reduced tactile acuity in chronic low back pain is linked with structural neuroplasticity in primary somatosensory cortex and is modulated by acupuncture therapy,"Prior studies have shown that patients suffering from chronic Low Back Pain (cLBP) have impaired somatosensory processing including reduced tactile acuity, i.e. reduced ability to resolve fine spatial details with the perception of touch. The central mechanism(s) underlying reduced tactile acuity are unknown but may include changes in specific brain circuitries (e.g. neuroplasticity in the primary somatosensory cortex, S1). Furthermore, little is known about the linkage between changes in tactile acuity and the amelioration of cLBP by somatically-directed therapeutic interventions, such as acupuncture. In this longitudinal neuroimaging study, we evaluated healthy control adults (HC, N ​= ​50) and a large sample of cLBP patients (N ​= ​102) with structural brain imaging (T1-weighted MRI for Voxel-Based Morphometry, VBM; Diffusion Tensor Imaging, DTI) and tactile acuity testing using two-point discrimination threshold (2PDT) over the lower back (site of pain) and finger (control) locations. Patients were evaluated at baseline and following a 4-week course of acupuncture, with patients randomized to either verum acupuncture, two different forms of sham acupuncture (designed with or without somatosensory afference), or no-intervention usual care control. At baseline, cLBP patients demonstrated reduced acuity (greater 2PDT, P ​= ​0.01) over the low back, but not finger (P ​= ​0.29) locations compared to HC, suggesting that chronic pain affects tactile acuity specifically at body regions encoding the experience of clinical pain. At baseline, Gray Matter Volume (GMV) was elevated and Fractional Anisotropy (FA) was reduced, respectively, in the S1-back region of cLBP patients compared to controls (P ​< ​0.05). GMV in cLBP correlated with greater 2PDT-back scores (ρ ​= ​0.27, P ​= ​0.02). Following verum acupuncture, tactile acuity over the back was improved (reduced 2PDT) and greater improvements were associated with reduced S1-back GMV (ρ ​= ​0.52, P ​= ​0.03) and increased S1-back adjacent white matter FA (ρ ​= ​-0.56, P ​= ​0.01). These associations were not seen for non-verum control interventions. Thus, S1 neuroplasticity in cLBP is linked with deficits in tactile acuity and, following acupuncture therapy, may represent early mechanistic changes in somatosensory processing that track with improved tactile acuity.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,Yes
#8316,Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy in cancer patients: a four-arm randomized trial on the effectiveness of electroacupuncture,"Purpose. Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a common and dose-limiting side effect of cytostatic drugs. Since there are no proven therapeutic procedures against CIPN, we were interested to define the role of electroacupuncture (EA) from which preliminary data showed promising results. Methods. In a randomized trial with a group sequential adaptive design in patients with CIPN, we compared EA (LV3, SP9, GB41, GB34, LI4, LI11, SI3, and HT3; n = 14) with hydroelectric baths (HB, n = 14), vitamin B1/B6 capsules (300/300 mg daily; VitB, n = 15), and placebo capsules (n = 17). The statistical power in this trial was primarily calculated for proving EA only, so results of HB and VitB are pilot data. Results. CIPN complaints improved by 0.8 ± 1.2 (EA), 1.7 ± 1.7 (HB), 1.6 ± 2.0 (VitB), and 1.3 ± 1.3 points (placebo) on a 10-point numeric rating scale without significant difference between treatment groups or placebo. In addition no significant differences in sensory nerve conduction studies or quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C30) were found. Conclusions. The used EA concept, HB, and VitB were not superior to placebo. Since, contrary to our results, studies with different acupuncture concepts showed a positive effect on CIPN, the effect of acupuncture on CIPN remains unclear. Further randomized, placebo controlled studies seem necessary. This trial is registered with DRKS00004448.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes
#8317,Auricular acupuncture at the "shenmen" and "point zero" points induced parasympathetic activation,"Purpose. Since auricular acupuncture is a diagnostic and treatment system based on normalizing the body's dysfunction, auricular acupuncture has been applied for pain relief, relaxation, and so on. These techniques would modulate the autonomic nerve system, thereby inducing the above-mentioned effects. The aim was to see the effect of auricular acupuncture applied to the ""Shenmen"" and ""Point Zero"" points on the postoperative heart rate variability (HRV). Methods. Twenty-six patients who underwent hemicolectomy under general anesthesia were randomized into the control or the acupuncture group. After the operation and before emergence, the acupuncture group received auricular acupuncture. An electrocardiographic unit was placed for recording the autonomic nervous activities. Results. The low frequency (LF)/high frequency (HF) ratio of HRV increased (P = 0.0007) in the control, but the ratio in the acupuncture did not change. There were significant differences between the ratios of the two groups at 3 : 00, 4 : 00, and 5 : 00. HF of the acupuncture group tended to be higher. HFs of the acupuncture group were significantly higher than those of the control group at 3 : 00, 4 : 00, and 5 : 00. Conclusion. Auricular acupuncture kept the LF/HF ratio at lower levels and HF at higher levels during postoperative period in the patients who had undergone hemicolectomy.",No,No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No
#8328,Effects of acupuncture and acupressure on cancer-related fatigue: a systematic review,"PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: To critically examine the evidence for acupuncture and acupressure in the management of cancer-related fatigue (CRF) in adult patients with cancer. DATA SOURCES: 18 databases were searched for randomized, controlled trials published in English and Chinese through April 2014. DATA SYNTHESIS: Given the heterogeneity of data, meta-analysis was not conducted. A six-step thematic analysis method was used to synthesize the results. CONCLUSIONS: Although results are inconclusive, acupuncture and acupressure tend to be effective in relieving CRF, with the former producing a greater improvement. Future research is recommended to contribute further evidence. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Nurses should know about the relative effectiveness of acupuncture and acupressure in the management of CRF to educate and support their patients.",Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#8352,Electroacupuncture most effectively elicits depressor and bradycardic responses at 1 Hz in humans,"PURPOSE: Acupuncture stimulation is known to act on the autonomic nervous system and elicits depressor and bradycardic effects. However, previous studies on humans did not conduct quantitative analyses on optimal acupuncture conditions such as the stimulation frequency and duration to achieve maximum depressor and bradycardic effects. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of varying stimulation frequencies of electroacupuncture on time-dependent changes in blood pressure and heart rate in humans. METHODS: Twelve healthy volunteers participated in the study. An acupuncture needle was inserted at the Ximen acupoint (PC4 according to WHO nomenclature), located at the anterior aspect of the forearm. An electrical stimulation was delivered through the acupuncture needle at an intensity of 1 V, pulse width of 5 ms, and stimulation frequencies of 0.5, 1, 5, and 10 Hz in a random order. The duration of electroacupuncture was 6 min, during which blood pressure and heart rate responses were monitored. RESULTS: Group-averaged data indicated that 1-Hz electroacupuncture decreased blood pressure and heart rate. Blood pressure was significantly decreased from the prestimulation baseline value of 86.6 ± 2.9 to 81.4 ± 2.3 mmHg during 4-6 min of 1-Hz electroacupuncture (mean ± SE, P < 0.01). Heart rate was also significantly decreased (from 66.2 ± 2.0 to 62.7 ± 1.7 beats/min, P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: These results provide fundamental evidence that bradycardiac and depressor responses are effectively produced by electrical acupuncture in humans.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#8355,Acupuncture as an Adjunctive Therapy to Etoricoxib for Patients with Acute Gouty Arthritis: Protocol for a Multicenter Randomized Controlled Trial,"PURPOSE: Acute gouty arthritis (AGA) is often managed with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. However, patients still tolerate severe pain before the analgesic takes effect. Early adjuvant analgesia is necessary in the pharmacological management of AGA. Acupuncture has the advantage of quick analgesia; nevertheless, the evidence to support the use of early-acupuncture as an adjunctive therapy for AGA is limited. This study aims to assess the efficacy of acupuncture compared with sham acupuncture on pain relief among AGA patients who are concurrently receiving etoricoxib. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this multicenter, randomized, controlled trial, total 160 eligible patients with AGA will be randomly allocated into acupuncture group and sham acupuncture group in a 1:1 ratio. All patients will receive oral etoricoxib followed by 30-minute acupuncture or sham acupuncture for 1 session. The primary outcome is the change in pain intensity (Visual Analogue Scale) after the 30-minute acupuncture treatment from baseline. The secondary outcomes include tenderness of study joint, swelling of study joint, rescue medicine, credibility and expectation evaluation and blinding assessment. Adverse events will be recorded during the trial. All the patients who are randomized in this study will be included in the intention-to-treat analysis.

#8357,Immediate Efficacy of Contralateral Acupuncture on SI3 Combined with Active Exercise for Acute Lumbar Sprains: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial,"PURPOSE: Acute lumbar sprain (ALS) is a common clinical disease characterized by persistent intolerable low back pain and limitation of movement, and quick pain relief and restoration of mobility in a short time are the main needs of patients when they visit the clinic. This study aims to evaluate the immediate efficacy of contralateral acupuncture (CAT) on SI3 combined with active exercise in treating ALS. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study is a randomized controlled trial which will recruit 118 eligible participants aged 18 to 55 years with ALS at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Yunnan University of Chinese Medicine between March 2024 and December 2026. Participants will be randomly assigned to the acupuncture group or the sham-acupuncture group in a 1:1 ratio. The acupuncture group will receive a 10-minute acupuncture treatment combined with active exercise, while the sham-acupuncture group will receive a 10-minute sham acupuncture treatment combined with active exercise. Randomization will use a computer-generated sequence with allocation concealed in opaque envelopes. The primary outcome will be the pain visual analogue scale (VAS) scores after 10 minutes of treatment. Secondary outcomes will include the pain VAS scores at other time points (2, 4, 6, and 8 minutes post-treatment), the lumbar range of motion (ROM) scores at various time points, blinded assessment, the treatment effect expectancy scale, and the rescue analgesia rate. The analysis will follow the intention-to-treat principle. The primary outcome will be analyzed using ANCOVA, and secondary outcomes with repeated measures ANOVA. The rescue analgesia rate will be assessed using either the χ(2) test or Fisher's exact test. DISCUSSION: This study is the first randomized controlled trial to assess the immediate efficacy of CAT in combination with active exercise for ALS. This study will provide a simple, rapid, and effective treatment for the clinical management of ALS.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#8360,Acupuncture Therapies for Individuals with Overweight or Obesity: An Overview of Systematic Reviews,"PURPOSE: An increasing number of people are affected by overweight or obesity, and the personal and social health burden is growing rapidly. Acupuncture is gaining popularity as an alternative treatment to manage weight. This research aims to update and synthesize the evidence of acupuncture therapies from systematic reviews for treating overweight and obesity. METHODS: Nine databases were searched from their inception to March 2022. Overweight or obesity was classified using standard diagnostic criteria. Published systematic reviews that included randomized controlled trials and quasi-randomized studies were eligible. Quality was assessed via the AMSTAR-2 scale and risk of bias using the ROBIS tool. RESULTS: Thirty-eight systematic reviews were identified. Acupuncture therapies and auricular acupoint stimulation showed benefits in terms of reducing body weight and body mass index. Catgut embedding therapy and abdominal acupuncture are currently not in widespread use with insufficient evidence. Acupuncture therapies appear to be safe. Most of the reviews were assessed as having high risk of bias and low confidence in the findings. CONCLUSION: There is a need for larger and more methodologically sound randomized controlled trials to evaluate the effectiveness of acupuncture therapies for individuals who are affected by overweight or obesity.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#8369,Acupuncture-point stimulation for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting,"PURPOSE: Assess the effectiveness of acupuncture-point stimulation on acute and delayed chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in cancer patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Randomized trials of acupuncture-point stimulation by needles, electrical stimulation, magnets, or acupressure were retrieved. Data were provided by investigators of the original trials and pooled using a fixed-effects model. RESULTS: Eleven trials (N = 1,247) were pooled. Overall, acupuncture-point stimulation reduced the proportion of acute vomiting (relative risks [RR] = 0.82; 95% CI, 0.69 to 0.99; P = .04), but not the mean number of acute emetic episodes or acute or delayed nausea severity compared with controls. By modality, stimulation with needles reduced the proportion of acute vomiting (RR = 0.74; 95% CI, 0.58 to 0.94; P = .01), but not acute nausea severity. Electroacupuncture reduced the proportion of acute vomiting (RR = 0.76; 95% CI, 0.60 to 0.97; P = .02), but manual acupuncture did not; delayed symptoms were not reported. Acupressure reduced mean acute nausea severity (standardized mean difference = -0.19; 95% CI, -0.38 to -0.01; P = .03) and most severe acute nausea, but not acute vomiting or delayed symptoms. Noninvasive electrostimulation showed no benefit for any outcome. All trials used concomitant pharmacologic antiemetics, and all, except electroacupuncture trials, used state-of-the-art antiemetics. CONCLUSION: This review complements data on postoperative nausea and vomiting, suggesting a biologic effect of acupuncture-point stimulation. Electroacupuncture has demonstrated benefit for chemotherapy-induced acute vomiting, but studies with state-of-the-art antiemetics as well as studies for refractory symptoms are needed to determine clinical relevance. Acupressure seems to reduce chemotherapy-induced acute nausea severity, though studies did not involve a placebo control. Noninvasive electrostimulation seems unlikely to have a clinically relevant impact when patients are given state-of-the-art pharmacologic antiemetic therapy.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#8383,The efficacy of acupuncture in the treatment of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy in cancer patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"PURPOSE: Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a common side effect in cancer patients, often emerging within the first month of chemotherapy. Severe CIPN can disrupt daily life, necessitating chemotherapy adjustments or discontinuation, which may increase cancer mortality. No standardized treatment exists, but acupuncture is widely used in China for CIPN.This study aimed to comprehensively assess the actual efficacy of acupuncture in treating CIPN in cancer patients. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane Library up to October 2024 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on acupuncture for CIPN, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Methodological quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool (RoB 2.0) and the modified Jadad scale. A random-effects model was used to analyze the Effect Size (ES) and 95% Confidence Interval (CI).Data analysis was performed using RevMan 5.3 software. RESULTS: The final analysis incorporated 1,048 patients from 18 studies. The results presented in the forest plot demonstrated that, when compared to the control group, acupuncture exhibited superior efficacy in improving CIPN symptoms (RR = 1.11, 95%CI [1.01,1.21]), alleviating pain (SMD = -0.93, 95%CI [-1.63,-0.22]), enhancing quality of life (QoL) (MD =  - 1.14, 95%CI [- 1.97, - 0.31]), and reducing chemotherapy-related neurotoxicity (MD =  - 3.34, 95%CI [- 5.24, - 1.44]). Additionally, in alleviating CIPN-related pain, simple acupuncture demonstrates superior efficacy compared to electroacupuncture. CONCLUSION: This study clearly demonstrates that acupuncture offers more substantial benefits to CIPN patients compared to usual care, medication, vitamin, and sham acupuncture. This research serves as a valuable reference for cancer patients, physicians, nurses, and other professional medical practitioners.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#8391,Clinical Efficacy of Electroacupuncture in the Treatment of Chronic Neck Pain: A Randomized Clinical Trial,"PURPOSE: Chronic neck pain (CNP) is a common but challenging symptom in clinical practice. Acupuncture is widely used in alleviating the symptoms of CNP. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of electroacupuncture (EA) in patients with CNP and to quantify the specific effects of EA by controlling for placebo effects. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A randomized sham-controlled trial was conducted at the outpatient departments of single hospital in China from November 2019 to November 2020 and a total of 105 participants with CNP were enrolled. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to the EA group, sham electroacupuncture (SEA) group and waiting list (WL) group. The primary outcome was change in the Northwick Park Neck Pain Questionnaire (NPQ). Secondary outcomes included McGill Pain Questionnaire (MG), visual analogue scale (VAS) and pain threshold (PT). RESULTS: This randomized clinical trial included 98 patients. The EA group demonstrated a greater reduction in NPQ scores compared to the SEA group after 10 sessions (-7.2564, 95% CI=-12.2875 to -2.2253, P=0.0054) and at 3-month follow up (-7.0090, 95% CI=-10.5039 to -3.5140, P=0.0002). After 10 sessions, the EA and SEA groups exhibited greater reductions in NPQ scores compared to the WL group (EA vs WL: P <0.001, [95% CI=6.570 to 15.503]; SEA vs WL: P=0.027, [95% CI=0.578 to 9.580]). However, the EA group achieved clinically significant NPQ improvements (>25%), whereas the SEA group failed to meet this criterion. CONCLUSION: This randomized clinical trial found that, in patients with CNP, EA significantly improved the symptoms compared with SEA and WL groups both immediately and cumulatively (at 5 weeks), and these benefits persisted through week 17. These comparisons demonstrated that EA's clinical benefits exceeded placebo effects.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes
#8398,Interest and Willingness to Pay for Integrative Therapies of Patients With Cancer and Caregivers,"PURPOSE: Complementary and integrative medicine (CIM) services are more prevalent in cancer centers but continue to be underutilized by patients. This study examines perspectives from patients and caregivers about these services being offered at a comprehensive cancer center. METHODS: Patients and caregivers were surveyed about their familiarity, interest, and experience with five CIM therapies: acupuncture, massage, meditation, music therapy, and yoga. Respondents were asked about their interest in and/or paying for these services at baseline, when recommended by their medical team, and when offered in a clinical trial. Respondents were also asked about perceived barriers to accessing these services. Chi-squared tests were performed to explore associations between past experience, interest levels, and willingness to pay. RESULTS: A total of 576 surveys were obtained (464 patients and 112 caregivers). Most respondents identified as White or Caucasian (65.6%), female (57.2%), had been a patient for < 3 years (74.2%), had some college education (73.8%), and made > $40,000 in US dollars as their annual household income (69.1%). Respondents were most familiar with therapeutic massage (34.2%) and least familiar with acupuncture (20.0%). The average interest in these services increased from 53.3% to 64.1% when recommended by a medical professional. Respondents were most willing to pay $1-60 for therapeutic massage (62.3%) and least willing to pay for meditation (43.7%). The main barriers to accessing CIM services were cost (56.0%) and lack of knowledge (52.1%). CONCLUSION: Overall, a significant proportion of patients and caregivers were unfamiliar with these five integrative therapies. Increasing education, decreasing cost, and a recommendation by medical professionals would improve CIM usage.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#8407,Efficacy of complementary and alternative medicine therapies in relieving cancer pain: a systematic review,"PURPOSE: Despite widespread popular use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies, a rigorous evidence base about their efficacy for cancer-related pain is lacking. This is a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating CAM therapies for cancer-related pain. METHODS: RCTs using CAM interventions for cancer-related pain were abstracted using Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED, and Cochrane database. RESULTS: Eighteen trials were identified (eight poor, three intermediate, and seven high quality based on Jadad score), with a total of 1,499 patients. Median sample size was 53 patients, and median intervention duration was 45 days. All studies were from single institutions, four had sample size justification, and none reported any adverse effects. Seven trials reported significant benefit for the following CAM therapies: acupuncture (n = 1), support groups (n = 2), hypnosis (n = 1), relaxation/imagery (n = 2), and herbal supplement/HESA-A (n = 1, but study was of low quality without control data). Seven studies reported immediate postintervention or short-term benefit of the following CAM interventions: acupuncture (n = 2), music (n = 1), herbal supplement/Ai-Tong-Ping (n = 1), massage (n = 1), and healing touch (n = 2). Four studies reported no benefit of CAM interventions (music, n = 2; massage, n = 2) in reducing cancer pain compared with a control arm. CONCLUSION: There is paucity of multi-institutional RCTs evaluating CAM interventions for cancer pain with adequate power, duration, and sham control. Hypnosis, imagery, support groups, acupuncture, and healing touch seem promising, particularly in the short term, but none can be recommended because of a paucity of rigorous trials. Future research should focus on methodologically strong RCTs to determine potential efficacy of these CAM interventions.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#8408,Moxibustion for diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials,"PURPOSE: Diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) is a common functional gastrointestinal disorder that imposes heavy burden on individuals and society. Asan external therapy of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), moxibustion is usually used to treat IBS-D. This study aimed to explore the efficacy of moxibustion in treating patients with IBS-D. METHODS: A systematic search for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that reported the use of moxibustion in IBS-D treatment was performed in eight databases. RESULTS: Eleven RCTs including 725 participants meet the inclusion criteria. Compared with other positive treatments (Western medicine, TCM prescription, and acupuncture), moxibustion treatment had superior effects against IBS-D according to the meta-analysis. CONCLUSION: This systematic review provided preliminary research evidence that moxibustion is effective in treating IBS-D. Rigorously designed and large-scale RCTs are required to provide more robust evidence in this area.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#8433,Acupuncture for the alleviation of hot flashes in men treated with androgen ablation therapy,"PURPOSE: Hot flashes are common side effect due to androgen ablation therapy (AAT). The utility of acupuncture for hot flashes in men has not been thoroughly studied. We prospectively studied the effect of acupuncture in men with hot flashes. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The study was approved by internal review board. Seventeen men with hot flashes and history of AAT for prostate cancer were enrolled. Three men declined participation before receiving any treatment. A hot flash score (HFS) was used to measure daily hot flashes. The composite daily score was calculated as the product of frequency × severity. The baseline daily scores were compared with scores taken at 2 and 6 weeks and at 8-month average follow-up. RESULTS: No side effects were encountered during, immediately after treatment, or at 8 months. The mean initial HFS was 28.3; it dropped to 10.3 (p = 0.0001) at 2 weeks posttreatment, 7.5 (p = 0.0001) at 6 weeks, and 7.0 (p = 0.001) at 8 months. Clinical improvement for each patient is defined as the percent decrease in the mean HFS at each time point. The mean improvement at Weeks 2 and 6 was 68.4% (mean HFS decreased from 37.409 to 11.836, p = 0.001) and 89.2% (mean HFS decreased from 37.409 to 4.05, p = 0.0078) respectively. The improvement at 8 months was 80.3% (mean HFS decreased from 37.409 to 7.385, p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Acupuncture provides excellent control of hot flashes in men with a history of AAT. The absence of side effects and the durable response at 8 months are likely to be appealing to patients. Prospective randomized study is warranted to further evaluate this modality against medical therapy.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#8443,Comparison of different positioning techniques for reduction of induced vertical deviation following Nishida procedure for the treatment of sixth nerve palsy,"PURPOSE: Induced vertical deviation is a potential complication following the Nishida procedure for the treatment of sixth nerve palsy. This study aims to compare different positioning techniques for the reduction of this complication. METHODS: We retrospectively examined medical records from consecutive patients who underwent the Nishida procedure, classifying them into three positioning groups: intra-quadrant (IQP), lateral rectus border (LRBP), and horizontal meridian (HMP). Surgical and pre/postoperative data were compared. RESULTS: Among the 27 included patients (8 IQP, 9 LRBP, 10 HMP), all three groups demonstrated similar reductions in esodeviation: IQP, 44.0 ± 18.7 Prism Diopters (PD); LRBP, 42.2 ± 15.3 PD; HMP, 42.2 ± 7.8 PD; (P = 0.675). After surgery, one patient in the IQP group developed hypertropia of 18 PD, necessitating a secondary surgery to treat the vertical diplopia. In the LRBP group, two patients had hypotropia of 30 PD and 10 PD, respectively, and one patient had hypertropia of 6 PD. In the HMP group, one patient initially had hypertropia of 2 PD, which resolved during subsequent follow-up. A lower incidence of induced vertical deviation was observed in the HMP (10%) and IQP (13%) groups compared to the LRBP group (33%). However, this difference did not reach statistical significance due to the small sample size. CONCLUSION: There is no statistically significant difference among the three positioning techniques (IQP, LRBP, HMP) in the correction of esodeviation and reduction of incidence of induced vertical deviation following Nishida procedure.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#8475,The effectiveness of acupressure for managing postoperative pain in patients with thoracoscopic surgery: A randomized control trial,"PURPOSE: More than 86% patients experience moderate to severe pain after thoracoscopic surgery. A combination of diverse nonpharmacological pain relief methods is a developing trend for pain management. The purpose of this study was to explore the effect of acupressure in reducing pain after thoracoscopic surgery. DESIGN: A Randomized controlled study with purpose sampling was used for this study. Patients who underwent thoracoscopic surgery at a medical center in central Taiwan were enrolled. Study data was collected from September 2020 to April 2021 after the approval of the institutional review board. A total of 100 participants were randomized into two groups (49 and 51 in the experimental and control groups, respectively). METHODS: Participants in the experimental group received acupressure at the Neiguan (PC6) and Shenmen (HT7) acupoints thrice a day for 2 days, whereas those in the control group received routine treatment and did not receive acupressure. The measurement included questionnaires for the collection of general information, physiological information, and disease rating scale. The Visual Analogue Scale-Pain (VAS-P) was used to measure the severity of pain. SPSS statistical software was used for data analysis. Independent sample t-test and chi-squared test were used for descriptive statistics, and paired t-test and linear mixed model were used to examine the effect of acupressure in alleviating pain. FINDINGS: After acupressure intervention, the pain score of the experimental group was lower than that of the control group, and this difference was significant β = 17.76, p < 0.001 on day 1 after intervention; β = 19.80, p < 0.001 on day 2 after intervention. The postoperative pain score in the experimental group on day 2 after intervention was significantly lower than that in the control group (t = 2.039, p = 0.044). After the subjects received acupressure, pain index significantly decreased after considering the interaction between time and group (p < 0.001). Regardless of the type of surgery, there were significant differences in pain index when the interaction between time and group was considered (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This study provided an experimental basis that acupressure can help in pain management in patients after thoracoscopic surgery, and the pain relief results become more significant as the duration of intervention increases. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Acupressure is effective in relieving postoperative pain in any type of thoracoscopic surgery. Nurses can use acupressure to help control pain in patients after thoracoscopic surgery.",No,No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No
#8478,Corneal shapes of Chinese emmetropes and myopic astigmats aged 10 to 45 years,"PURPOSE: Myopia and astigmatism are highly prevalent in the Hong Kong Chinese. This study aimed to determine the effects of age and myopic astigmatism (MA) on the corneal shape factors in the Hong Kong Chinese. METHODS: One hundred subjects with compound MA or emmetropia (EM) were recruited from three age groups: 10 to 15 years (n = 32), 20 to 25 years (n = 37), and 40 to 45 years (n = 31). Refractive errors were measured by noncycloplegic subjective refraction. Corneal astigmatism and corneal shape factors were measured by the Scheimpflug-based Pentacam. The effects of age and refractive errors on the whole corneal shape (mean-P) and the semimeridian corneal shapes (semi-Ps) at the nasal, temporal, superior, and inferior corneal quadrants (from corneal apex to 3 mm peripheral cornea) were analyzed. RESULTS: Age had significant effects on the mean-P and semi-Ps (both p < 0.001), with both EM and MA showing less prolate corneal shapes in older age groups. Partial correlation analyses adjusted for age showed that mean-P and semi-Ps were correlated with multiple refractive-error components (Pearson r = -0.30 to -0.78, all p < 0.05), with higher correlations found along the horizontal semi-Ps in MA (Pearson r = +0.37 to -0.78, all p < 0.01). Compared with EM, MA had more prolate temporal semi-Ps in all the three age groups (p < 0.05). Strikingly, age and refractive errors also had significant impacts on the asymmetry of the corneal shape along the horizontal meridian. CONCLUSIONS: Corneal shapes were influenced by age and MA in the Hong Kong Chinese. These results highlight the importance of controlling these factors when designing a study on corneal shape.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#8501,Effects of P6 stimulation on postoperative nausea and vomiting in laparoscopic cholecystectomy patients,"PURPOSE: Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) remains one of the most common postsurgical complications after anesthesia and surgery. Pericardium 6 (P6) stimulation is believed to prevent PONV and is a potential adjunctive treatment with pharmacologic agents. The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of P6 stimulation on PONV occurrence to a control group not receiving the P6 stimulation in sequential female patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystecomy at a community hospital in central Florida between November 2010 and March 2013. DESIGN: This study is a double-blinded randomized controlled trial. METHODS: PONV was measured on admission to the postanesthesia care unit (PACU), at 30 and 60 minutes, at discharge from the PACU to home and at two points at home up to 6 hours and between 6 and 24 hours. FINDINGS: Of the 56 total patients, those in the P6 group (n = 26) had statistically significant lower incidence of PONV, 0%, vs 14.3% in the control group (n = 27; P < .05) on admission to the PACU, but at all other time points, there was no significant difference in PONV. Thirty-one percent of the patients in the P6 group had PONV in PACU or at home compared with 51.9% in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the study demonstrate that the use of P6 stimulation in the perioperative arena is clinically meaningful; however, more research is needed with a larger sample size.",No,No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,Yes,No,Yes
#8510,2016 updated MASCC/ESMO consensus recommendations: prevention of radiotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting,"PURPOSE: Radiotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (RINV) are distressing symptoms. Evidence-based guidelines should facilitate the prescription of the best possible antiemetic prophylaxis. As part of the MASCC/ESMO Antiemetic Guidelines Update 2016, a thorough review of the literature concerning RINV since the 2009 update was required. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature including data published from June 2009 to May 2015 was performed. Committee VII (RINV) under the MASCC/ESMO Antiemetic Guidelines Update Committee assessed the literature. RESULTS: The searches yielded 926 records, 906 records were excluded, leaving 20 records for full text assessment, and 18 publications were finally included. The only fully published randomized studies in prevention of RINV were two negative studies in acupuncture and green tea, respectively. No data to support new recommendations for antiemetic prophylaxis in RINV was available. However, based on expert opinions, the committee agreed on changes in emetic risk level for certain sites of irradiation. CONCLUSIONS: The serotonin receptor antagonists are still the corner stone in antiemetic prophylaxis of nausea and vomiting induced by high and moderate emetic risk radiotherapy. The studies available since the last update did not change recommendations for antiemetic prophylaxis. The emetogenicity of craniospinal radiotherapy was reclassified from low to moderate emetic level along with some other minor changes. In the future, RINV prophylaxis in single fraction, multiple fraction, and in concomitant chemo-radiotherapy still need to be explored with regard to the different classes and combinations of antiemetic drugs.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#8518,The Opioid-Sparing Effect of Acupuncture After Abdominal Surgery: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocol,"PURPOSE: Routine overprescribing of postoperative opioid analgesics may induce side effects and correlate with chronic opioid use following surgery. This review aims to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture for opioid-sparing effects in patients who underwent abdominal surgery. METHODS: Eleven databases in different languages, including English (Ovid MEDLINE, CENTRAL, EMBASE, CINAHL), Chinese, Korean, and Japanese, will be searched. Randomized controlled trials using acupuncture for postoperative pain control in adult patients undergoing abdominal surgery will be screened. All randomized controlled trials comparing acupuncture with no treatment, sham acupuncture, and conventional treatments will be included. The Cochrane risk of bias tool will be used to assess the risk of bias. The primary outcome will consist of a cumulative opioid consumption. Additionally, the number of cumulative opioid analgesic demands/requests, the time to initial opioid analgesic usage, postoperative pain, opioid-related side effects, and adverse events of acupuncture will be assessed. The mean differences or risk ratios with a 95% confidence interval will be calculated to estimate the pooled effect of acupuncture when it is possible to conduct a meta-analysis. RESULTS: This study could confirm the effect of opioid-sparing on acupuncture after abdominal surgery. CONCLUSION: This study would evaluate the evidence on the effectiveness of acupuncture after abdominal surgery with a focus on opioid intake. It provides evidence to support decision-making on applying acupuncture for postoperative management. REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42022311155.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#8539,Effectiveness of Acupuncture Therapy on Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting After Gynecologic Surgery: A Meta-Analysis and Systematic Review,"PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture therapy (AT) on postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) after gynecologic surgery (GS). DESIGN: A meta-analysis using a systematic search strategy was performed. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search of all published randomized controlled trials or prospective cohort studies assessing the effectiveness of AT on PONV in patients undergoing GS was conducted in three databases: PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library. The incidence of PONV, the use of rescue antiemetics, and side effects of AT were analyzed using the Review Manager 5.3 software. FINDINGS: Nine randomized controlled trials and one prospective cohort study identified in the literature search from database inception (1966) to December 31, 2019, including 1,075 participants were included in the present study. AT significantly reduced the risk of developing postoperative nausea and postoperative vomiting by 48% (relative risk = 0.52; 95% confidence interval, 0.44 to 0.61; P < .00001) and 42% (relative risk = 0.58; 95% confidence interval, 0.49 to 0.68; P < .00001), respectively. No significant differences in the incidence of side effects such as bleeding and needle pain were observed between groups (P = .54). AT was also associated with a lower rate of rescue antiemetic usage (P < .00001) and a higher degree of satisfaction with postoperative recovery (P < .0001). Moreover, the optimal therapeutic effect of AT on preventing PONV was achieved when the treatment time was controlled within 30 minutes and transcutaneous acupoint electrical stimulation was applied. CONCLUSION: AT is an effective and safe physical therapy for the prophylaxis of PONV in patients undergoing GS.",Yes,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#8542,"[Comparison of keratometric values and corneal eccentricity of myopia, hyperopia and emmetropia]","PURPOSE: The aim of this work is to compare the findings of keratometric values and their differences at various ametropias. The eccentricity of the cornea in the sense compared to the possible influence of refraction of the eye is topographically observed. Groups of myopia, hyperopia and emmetropia are always represented 100 subjects, i.e. 600 eyes. The results of these measurements are mutually compared and statistically processed. METHODS: The studied cohort a total of 300 clients enrolled. To measure the steepest (r1) and flattest meridian (r2) and to determine corneal eccentricity was used autorefraktokeratometer with Placido disc (KR 8100P, Topcon, Japan). The obtained data were processed with appropriate software and statistically evaluated. RESULTS: Group A consisted of 100 myopes (n = 200), 35 men and 65 women, average age 37.3 +/- 18.7 years (min. 10 years, max. 87 years). Objective refractive error - sphere: - 2.9 +/- 2.27 D (min.-0.25 D, -14.5 D max), cylinder: -0.88 +/- 0.75 D (min. -0.25 D, up to -5.0 D). Keratametry in this group is as follows: radius of curvature of the cornea in the front area of the steepest meridian 7.62 +/- 0.28 mm (min. 6.96 mm, max. 8.44 mm) and the flattest meridian is 7.76 +/- 0.3 mm (min. 7.08 mm, max 8.75 mm). The mean eccentricity was 0.37 +/- 0.12 (min 0.00, max. 0.79). Group B consisting of 100 hyperopic subjects (n = 200), 40 men and 60 women, average age 61.6 +/- 15 years (min. 21 years, max 88 years). Objective refraction in this group -sphere: +2.71 +/- 1.6 D (at least +0.25 D, up to +9.0 D), cylinder: -1.0 +/- 0.9 D (min. -0.25 D, max. -5.75 D).Corneal surface curvature in two main sections according keratometric measurement looks as follows: the steepest meridian is 7.67 +/- 0.29 mm (min. 6.99 mm, max. 8.62 mm), the flattest meridian then 7.81 +/- 0.29 mm (min. 7.10 mm, max. 8.70 mm). The value of the median eccentricity for these hundred hyperopes is 0.37 +/- 0.14 (min. 0.00; max 0.86). The third group C consists of 100 emetropic subjects (n = 200), then clients without refractive errors who achieve without corrective aids Vmin = 1.0. This group is composed of 42 men and 58 women, mean age 41.4 +/- 17.8 years (min. 3 years, max. 82 years). Measured values of objective refraction - sphere: +0.32 +/- 0.47 D (at least -1.75 D, up to +1.5 D), cylinder: -0.28 +/- 0.45 D (min. -1.25 D, up to +1.25 D). Keratometry values measured at the corneal surface in two perpendicular cross-section are: steepest meridian corresponds to the radius of curvature of 7.72 +/- 0.26 mm (min. 6.91 mm, max. 8.32 mm), the flattest meridian reaches values 7.83 +/- 0.25 mm (min. 7.10 mm, max. 8.53 mm). The median eccentricity is represented by the observed values of 0.36 +/- 0.11 (min 0.00; max. 0.57). Due to the validity of the results from the groups as unsuitable respondents with corneal astigmatism greater than -1.0 D were subsequently eliminated. CONCLUSION: Keratometry as well as topography is one of the fundamental methods of measuring corneal front surface. Their proportions are essential for the proper parameters selection, especially with contact lenses as one of the possible means intended to correct refractive errors. The study subjects were not included in any load condition cornea, purulent conjunctivitis, blepharitis, after refractive surgery or other eye symptoms.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#8549,The consultation and relational empathy measure: an investigation of its scaling structure,"PURPOSE: The Consultation and Relational Empathy (CARE) measure is recommended to evaluate the quality of care. However, there is no evidence that it is valid in rehabilitation. Aims were to examine the internal construct (factorial) validity of the CARE in the assessment of the patient-therapist relationship. METHOD: CARE data were part of an experimental study of acupuncture and different currently used acupuncture placebo controls, including 213 patients (age 66.8, SD 8.3, 58% female) with chronic stable hip or knee pain of mechanical origin, waiting for a joint replacement. CARE was completed two weeks into the study and on completion, two weeks later. DATA ANALYSIS: Cronbach alpha, factor analysis and Rasch analysis. RESULTS: Internal construct validity was supported (82% of variance explained by the first factor; fit to the Rasch model χ(2) = 18.2, P = 0.57). CARE was unidimensional, had local independence of items, good item fit, absence of Differential Item Functioning and invariance over time. Three percent of people did not complete items 9 & 10. CONCLUSIONS: CARE satisfied strict criteria for internal construct validity. An interval scale transformation is available that can be used in clinical practice and research. Further work is required to investigate item non-response and how this may be dealt with in clinical settings.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes
#8557,Multifocal pattern VEP perimetry: analysis of sectoral waveforms,"PURPOSE: The objective detection of local visual field defects using multi-focal pattern visual evoked potentials (VEP) has recently been described. The individual waveforms show variable polarity in different parts of the visual field due to underlying cortical convolutions. Normal trace arrays were examined to determine if certain areas of similar waveform could be grouped for analysis, while minimising cancellation of data. METHOD: The VEP was assessed using multi-focal pseudo-randomly alternated pattern stimuli which were cortically scaled in size. Bipolar occipital electrodes were used for recording. Waveforms were compared for different locations within the field up to 25 degrees of eccentricity. Analysis of sectors showing similarly shaped waveforms was performed. Twelve normal subjects were studied. RESULT: Grouping waveforms by sectors of similar waveform increased the total calculated upper hemifield amplitude by 60%, compared with simple summations of responses for the whole hemifield. The inferior hemifield showed more consistent waveforms throughout, with the amplitude only increasing by 11% with sectoral summation. Intra-subject variability (10.6%) is less for sectors than for individual points (17.3%). Inter-subject amplitude differences are high, calculated at 56% for individual points and 45% for sectors. CONCLUSIONS: Due to differences in waveform as a result of underlying cortical anatomy, individual VEP responses from multifocal recordings should be grouped as sectors along the vertical meridian and above and below the horizontal, rather than by hemifields or quadrants. This finding is significant if one is considering within-field grouping strategies similar to the glaucoma hemifield test used in conventional perimetry, or reporting derived overall VEP amplitudes and latencies from a multifocal recording. Large amplitude variations between individuals and small signals from horizontal and upper field seen in single channel recording, still limit the application of this technique as a form of objective perimetry.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#8588,"Peripheral Defocus, Pupil Size, and Axial Eye Growth in Children Wearing Soft Multifocal Contact Lenses in the BLINK Study","PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between peripheral defocus and pupil size on axial growth in children randomly assigned to wear either single vision contact lenses, +1.50 diopter (D), or +2.50 D addition multifocal contact lenses (MFCLs). METHODS: Children 7 to 11 years old with myopia (-0.75 to -5.00 D; spherical component) and ≤1.00 D astigmatism were enrolled. Autorefraction (horizontal meridian; right eye) was measured annually wearing contact lenses centrally and ±20 degrees, ±30 degrees, and ±40 degrees from the line of sight at near and distance. Photopic and mesopic pupil size were measured. The effects of peripheral defocus, treatment group, and pupil size on the 3-year change in axial length were modeled using multiple variables that evaluated defocus across the retina. RESULTS: Although several peripheral defocus variables were associated with slower axial growth with MFCLs, they were either no longer significant or not meaningfully associated with eye growth after the treatment group was included in the model. The treatment group assignment better explained the slower eye growth with +2.50 MFCLs than peripheral defocus. Photopic and mesopic pupil size did not modify eye growth with the +2.50 MFCL (all P ≥ 0.37). CONCLUSIONS: The optical signal causing slower axial elongation with +2.50 MFCLs is better explained by the lens type worn than by peripheral defocus. The signal might be something other than peripheral defocus, or there is not a linear dose-response relationship within treatment groups. We found no evidence to support pupil size as a criterion when deciding which myopic children to treat with MFCLs.",No,No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No
#8592,[The effects of hand-acupuncture therapy on intermittent abdominal pain in children],"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to identify the effects of hand acupuncture therapy on intermittent abdominal pain in children. METHOD: A quasi experimental pre-test and post (1,2)-test design was used. Data was collected from May, 2002 to February, 2003. Forty children were assigned to the experimental (20) or control group (20). The experimental group received Hand-Acupuncture therapy on the meridian point; A8, A9, A10, A11, A12, E22, E45 for 20 minutes, while the control group rested on the bed. Data was analyzed using the SAS program with Fisher's Exact chi (2) test, repeated measured ANOVA, and ANCOVA. RESULT: In the experimental group, pain intensity (f=63.26, p=0.00), A12(A)(F=60.40, p=0.00), and medication requirement (chi (2)=32.63, p=0.00) were significantly lower than that of the control group. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that hand acupuncture therapy is effective for reduction of intermittent abdominal pain.

#8626,Comparison of the Effectiveness of Three Different Acupuncture Methods for TMD-Related Pain: A Randomized Clinical Study,"PURPOSE: This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of three acupuncture methods for temporomandibular disorders- (TMDs-) related pain. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Different locations of pain, according to DC/TMD clinical assessment, were considered: temporomandibular joint (TMJ), masticatory muscles, head, and neck. Sixty patients were assigned randomly to one of three treatment groups (20 patients in each): group BA received body acupuncture, group EA received electroacupuncture, and group CA received acupuncture + cupping. The groups were compared in terms of pain (verbal numeric scale), pain-related disability (Brief Inventory Pain, BPI), and impression of the treatment's effectiveness (Patients' Global Impression of Improvement Scale, PGI-I). These were recorded before sessions of acupuncture treatment (T0), after 8 sessions of acupuncture treatment (T1), and after 4 weeks of follow-up after treatment (T2). The between-group and within-group differences in the data were analyzed statistically. The baseline characteristics were similar in all groups (p > 0.05). RESULTS: Significant improvements were noted in all types of pain compared to baseline values in all groups (all p < 0.05). No significant differences were noted in the improvement of TMDs-related pain according to the different acupuncture techniques (all p > 0.05). All acupuncture methods used resulted to be significantly effective in improving the pain-related interference in the patient's common activities and quality of life. EA resulted to be significantly more effective than BA and CA in improving the interference of pain with patients' mood (p=0.015) and quality of sleep (p=0.014). CONCLUSION: BA, EA, and CA are all effective acupuncture methods in reducing pain and pain interference with common activities and quality of life in patients affected by TMD.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No
#8634,Relationship between the axial length/corneal radius of curvature ratio and hyperopia reserve in preschool children aged 3 - 6 years,"PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the association between the axial length (AL) to average corneal curvature (CR) ratio and hyperopia reserve in preschool children. METHODS: AL, CR, horizontal and vertical meridians of the corneal radius (CR1, CR2), and 1% atropine cycloplegic refraction were measured in preschool children aged 3 - 6 years. The corneal curvatures were then used to calculate the AL/CR1, AL/CR2, and AL/CR ratios. RESULTS: A total of 338 children were included, comprising 178 boys (52.7%) and 160 girls (47.3%). The mean values for AL, CR, AL/CR1, AL/CR2, AL/CR, and spherical equivalent refractive error (SER) were 22.11 ± 0.88 mm, 7.77 ± 0.26 mm, 2.80 ± 0.09, 2.90 ± 0.09, 2.85 ± 0.09, and + 2.13 ± 1.46 D, respectively. AL, AL/CR1, AL/CR2, and AL/CR increased with age, showing significant differences among age groups (P < 0.001). Conversely, SER moved from higher hyperopia toward lesser hyperopia with age, also showing significant differences among age groups (P < 0.001). Linear regression equations were established, with Y representing hyperopia reserve and X representing AL/CR: Age 3: Y = 44.67 - 15.02X; Age 4: Y = 33.96 - 11.19X; Age 5: Y = 42.11 - 13.98X; Age 6: Y = 44.94 - 15.00X. These results suggest that the AL/CR ratio could be used to assess hyperopia reserve insufficiency. The optimal cut-off point for the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was ≥ 2.91, with a sensitivity, specificity, and Youden index of 0.84, 0.88, and 0.73, respectively. The critical value of the ROC curve increased with age in children aged 3 - 6 years. CONCLUSION: This cross-sectional study found that the hyperopia reserve in children of different ages can be estimated using the hyperopia reserve equation. Additionally, the AL/CR ratio can serve as an effective index for detecting hyperopia reserve insufficiency, with an optimal ROC curve cut-off point of ≥ 2.91 in preschool children aged 3 - 6 years, and the critical value increasing with age.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#8646,Efficacy of Low-Frequency Acupuncture Therapy Based on the Midnight-Noon Ebb-Flow Concept for Central Neurogenic Bladder: A Randomized Controlled Trial,"PURPOSE: This study aims to investigate the therapeutic efficacy and complications of low-frequency acupuncture therapy based on the Midnight-Noon Ebb-Flow concept in central neurogenic bladder (CNB). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was a prospective, randomized controlled trial. Sixty patients diagnosed with CNB without prior treatment were randomly divided into two groups: the control group (n = 30) was treated with basic rehabilitation training, and the treatment group (n = 30) was treated with basic rehabilitation training plus low-frequency acupuncture therapy based on the Midnight-Noon Ebb-Flow concept for 4 weeks. The fixed acupuncture points selected were: Sanyinjiao (bilateral), Zhongji (unilateral), and Diji (unilateral). The study compared pre- and post-treatment clinical curative effects, urodynamic indicators, urination status, the Neurogenic Bladder Symptom Score (NBSS), the Urinary Symptom Distress Scale (USDS), the World Health Organization Quality of Life Brief Inventory (WHOQOL-BREF), and the occurrence of adverse reactions and complications between the two groups. RESULTS: The overall efficacy rate of 96.67% in the treatment group was significantly higher than that in the control group (86.67%) (P < 0.05). After treatment, the MBC, MFR, Pdet, DASUV, and WHOQOL-BREF scores significantly increased, while the RUV, DUF, DAUL, NBSS and USDS scores all decreased in both groups, with the treatment group showing significantly better results than the control group (P < 0.05). There was no statistically significant difference in adverse reactions and complication rates between the two groups (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Low-frequency acupuncture therapy based on the Midnight-Noon Ebb-Flow concept significantly improves bladder function and alleviates urinary difficulties in CNB, demonstrating good safety and considerable clinical applicability.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes
#8657,The characteristics of registered acupuncture clinical trials enrolling cancer patients,"PURPOSE: This study sought to explore and summarize the global state of acupuncture clinical trials enrolling cancer patients included in international registries to date. METHODS: All relevant trials evaluating acupuncture-related interventions for the treatment of cancer that were registered in 16 trial registries from January 1, 2001, through December 31, 2020, were identified. Subsequent publications related to these trials were additionally retrieved from the PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, CNKI (China National Knowledge Infrastructure), VIP (China Science and Technology Journal Database), and Wanfang databases. We compared information included in these registries regarding completed trials with any associated publications, with a focus on study design, sample size, and selective reporting, based on the registered protocol. RESULTS: In total, 222 eligible trials across 19 countries were identified. These trials included 17 specific cancer types and 32 symptoms. The five most common cancer types were breast cancer, head and neck cancer, colorectal cancer, lung cancer, and gastric cancer, accounting for almost half of all registered trials (48.2%). The top five symptoms included in these trials were chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN), cancer-related pain, cancer-related fatigue, chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), and gastrointestinal dysfunction. The overall rate of article publication was low, with publications being associated with just 33.3% of these registered trials. CONCLUSIONS: This review is the first snapshot of the landscape of acupuncture clinical trials registered in international trial registries, providing a methodological basis for the management of common treatment- and disease-related side effects among cancer patients undergoing acupuncture and offering useful information that will guide future acupuncture-focused research.",No,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#8668,[Effect of an integral care system: a combination of oriental and western care for older adults with degenerative arthritis],"PURPOSE: This study was done to examine the effect of an integrated care service which included a combination of oriental and western care on health outcomes in elderly patients with degenerative arthritis. METHODS: A prospective comparative design was used. Data were collected from May 1, 2008 to June 30, 2009 from 85 elderly patients with degenerative arthritis in the lower extremities who were followed in a hospital out-patient department for 8 weeks. The integrated care service group (n=36) received a combination of physical therapy, acupuncture, western medicines or herbal medicines, and the western care group (n=49) received physical therapy or western medicines. Functional independence, walking speed, rotation balance, pain intensity, service satisfaction and total medical costs for the two groups were compared at 8 weeks. RESULTS: Functional independence (t=2.14, p=.036) and walking speed (t=2.51, p=.014) improved significantly in the integrated care group while pain intensity improved significantly in the western care group (t=3.35, p=.002). The integrated care group reported higher scores for service satisfaction (t=2.09, p=.041) and higher medical costs than the western care group (t=2.15, p=.035). CONCLUSION: The results suggest that integrated care services are effective modalities to improve mobility and quality of life for elders with degenerative arthritis.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,Yes
#8672,A systematic review of salivary gland hypofunction and/or xerostomia induced by non-surgical cancer therapies: prevention strategies,"PURPOSE: This systematic review aimed to assess the updated literature for the prevention of salivary gland hypofunction and xerostomia induced by non-surgical cancer therapies. METHODS: Electronic databases of MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCT) that investigated interventions to prevent salivary gland hypofunction and/or xerostomia. Literature search began from the 2010 systematic review publications from the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer/International Society of Oral Oncology (MASCC/ISOO) up to February 2024. Two independent reviewers extracted information regarding study design, study population, cancer treatment modality, interventions, outcome measures, methods, results, risk of bias (RoB version 2), and conclusions for each article. RESULTS: A total of 51 publications addressing preventive interventions were included. Eight RCTs on tissue-sparing radiation modalities were included showing significant lower prevalence of xerostomia, with unclear effect on salivary gland hypofunction. Three RCTs on preventive acupuncture showed reduced prevalence of xerostomia but not of salivary gland hypofunction. Two RCTs on muscarinic agonist stimulation with bethanechol suggested a preventive effect on saliva flow rate and xerostomia in patients undergoing head and neck radiation or radioactive iodine therapy. Two studies on submandibular gland transfer showed higher salivary flow rates compared to pilocarpine and lower prevalence of xerostomia compared to no active intervention. There is insufficient evidence on the effectiveness of vitamin E, amifostine, photobiomodulation, and miscellaneous preventive interventions. CONCLUSION: This systematic review continues to support the potential of tissue-sparing tecniques and intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) to preserve salivary gland function in patients with head and neck cancer, with limited evidence on other preventive strategies, including acupuncture and bethanecol. Preventive focus should be on optimized and new approaches developed to further reduce radiation dose to the parotid, the submandibular, and minor salivary glands. As these glands are major contributors to moistening of the oral cavity, limiting the radiation dose to the salivary glands through various modalities has demonstrated reduction in prevalence and severity of salivary gland hypofunction and xerostomia. There remains no evidence on preventive approaches for checkpoint inhibitors and other biologicals due to the lack of RCTs.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#8678,"Adverse effects of non-hormonal pharmacological interventions in breast cancer survivors, suffering from hot flashes: A systematic review and meta-analysis","PURPOSE: To access frequency and severity of adverse effects (AE) of non-hormonal drugs (NHD) for hot flashes in breast cancer survivors compared to controls and analyze adverse-effect risk by reviewing published randomized trials. METHODS: Cochrane Central Register for Controlled Trials, Embase, Medline, PsycINFO and PubMed databases were searched. Trials were included where participants were survivors of breast cancer suffering from hot flashes, treatment included self-administered venlafaxine, gabapentin or clonidine, and AE were reported. AE frequency and severity were graded. A meta-analysis of ten trials with sub-group analyses was conducted. RESULTS: Forty-nine studies were identified, and 12 were included. A total of 1467 participants experienced 772 adverse effects, 81 % (n = 627) in the treatment group and 19 % (n = 145) in the control group. Sixty-seven percent of AE was graded as mild and 33 % as moderate. The frequency of AE for NHD was overall significant compared to placebo. Sub-group analysis indicated that AE frequency and severity increased at higher doses of venlafaxine and gabapentin compared to placebo. CONCLUSION: The odds for experiencing AE was significantly higher in patients randomized to high-dose NHD than those randomized to controls, including placebo, low-dose medication and acupuncture. These therapies should be considered as a potential treatment alternative.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#8679,Fluctuations in corneal curvature limit predictability of intraocular lens power calculations,"PURPOSE: To analyze fluctuations in corneal curvature over time. SETTING: Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom. DESIGN: Case series. METHODS: A 3-piece IOL was implanted in 1 eye and a 1-piece IOL in the other eye through a 3.2 mm clear corneal temporal incision. Keratometry was performed preoperatively and at several points in time postoperatively. Differences between measurements were analyzed by power vectors. Statistical significance was assessed by monovariate, bivariate, and trivariate paired t tests. Acute angle shifts were determined as differences between meridians at 2 points in time. RESULTS: Fifty patients were enrolled. From preoperatively to 1 year postoperatively, the changes in vector components (M, J0, J45) were, respectively, -0.02 diopter (D) ± 0.23 (SD) (P=.38), -0.07 ± 0.27 D (P=.02), and +0.04 ± 0.25 D (P=.14). Corresponding changes from 1 year to 2 years postoperatively were +0.01 ± 0.25 D (P=.73), +0.01 ± 0.23 D (P=.83), and +0.01 ± 0.16 D (P=.40). The meridian shift was -5 ± 32 degrees (P=.13) from preoperatively to postoperatively and +3 ± 22 degrees (P=.23) from 1 year to 2 years. CONCLUSIONS: Surgically induced astigmatism was composed of slight flattening in the horizontal meridian and slight steepening in the oblique meridian but was insignificant in relation to random fluctuations, which were almost equally large between postoperative measurements 1 year apart. The fluctuations were not due to imprecision in measurement. FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE: Dr. Norrby is a retiree from Abbott Medical Optics, Inc., and holder of a small amount of stock.

#8680,Effect of congenital ptosis on corneal topography and total aberrometry and comparison of these variables between ptotic and normal fellow eyes,"PURPOSE: To analyze the effect of congenital ptosis on corneal topography and total aberrometry and to compare these variables between ptotic and normal fellow eyes. METHODS: The study included 32 eyes of 16 patients with unilateral congenital blepharoptosis. A Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor was employed to assess Zernike coefficients and root-mean-square. Computerized corneal topography, Orbscan and aberrometry were measured in the healthy and ptotic eyes. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 16. P<0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: The mean patient age was 21.31±6.3 years. The mean margin to light reflex distance-1 (MRD-1) was 0.6±1.44mm in the ptotic eyes. Among topography variables, surface regularity index (SRI), cylinder power, irregular astigmatism index (IAI), and flat meridian keratometry were significantly different between ptotic and non-ptotic fellow eyes (P<0.05). Some Orbscan parameters, including simulated keratometry, maximum and minimum corneal power, and astigmatism power were significantly different between ptotic and normal fellow eyes (P<0.05). There was no statistically significant difference in total aberrometry variables between paired eyes. However, in a comparison between ptotic eyes with over 1 diopter astigmatism vs. less than 1 D, high-order Zernike modes without spherical aberration at 6mm (HOW/O Z(400) 6mm) were significantly different between the 2 groups (P=0.02). CONCLUSION: Unilateral congenital ptosis significantly affects corneal topography and aberrometry, especially in eyes with astigmatism≥1 D. Such differences need to be considered before keratorefractive surgery (KRS).",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#8687,Comparative analysis of corneal measurements obtained from a Scheimpflug camera and an integrated Placido-optical coherence tomography device in normal and keratoconic eyes,"PURPOSE: To assess the agreement between a Scheimpflug camera (Pentacam) and a combined Placido-optical coherence tomography device (Visante OMNI) in measuring corneal curvature, thickness and elevation values in normal and keratoconic eyes. METHODS: Corneal measurements of 110 normal eyes (one eye per subject) and 70 keratoconic eyes were obtained from both devices and compared. Agreement was determined using the Bland-Altman analysis 95% limits of agreement (LoA). RESULTS: The Pentacam measured significantly greater keratometry readings in the flattest (K1) and steepest meridians (K2) in normal and keratoconic eyes. The 95% LoA in normal eyes were -0.32 to 0.59 dioptres (D) (K1) and -0.41 to 0.74 D (K2). In keratoconic eyes, the 95% LoA were -1.35 to 1.92 D (K1) and -1.38 to 1.99 D (K2). The Pentacam recorded significantly higher central corneal thickness (CCT) values in both groups of eyes. The 95% LoA were -4.31 to 39.89 microns (μ) and -12.92 to 41.35 μ in normal and keratoconic eyes, respectively. Pentacam anterior and posterior corneal elevations were significantly greater in both groups of eyes. The devices demonstrated excellent repeatability and reproducibility for corneal curvature and thickness but not elevation measurements. CONCLUSIONS: The Pentacam measured significantly greater corneal curvature, thickness and elevation values compared to the Visante OMNI in normal and keratoconic eyes. The devices agree moderately for anterior corneal elevations in normal eyes and do not appear to be interchangeable for corneal measurements in clinical practice.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#8702,[Assessing the influence of chin prominence on perceived facial aesthetics among three groups of observers],"PURPOSE: To assess the influence of chin prominence on facial aesthetics with 3D images, to investigate the cognitive boundaries of chin prominence among orthodontists, general dentists and laypeople and compare the variance of their cognitive data, in order to provide quantitative reference for selection of clinical treatment. METHODS: A 3D facial image was obtained by 3dMD. The soft tissue pogonion point was altered in 2 mm increments from -10 to 10 mm with Geomagic Wrap 2015, in order to represent retrusion and protrusion of the chin. These images were rated by orthodontists, general dentists and laypeople with VAS scores. Multivariate mixed linear regression was used to analyze the influence of gender, age and chin prominence on VAS scores, and whether there were differences among different groups with SAS 9.4 software package. ANOVA was also applied for comparison of each prominence. RESULTS: This study was composed of 243 subjects, including 90 orthodontists, 101 general dentists and 52 laypeople. Chin prominence had significant effect on VAS scores. VAS scores decreased by 0.8910 for each unit increase in chin retrusion and decreased by 1.0958 for each unit increase in chin protrusion（P<0.01）. Desire for treatment started when chin retrusion exceeded 6 mm in orthodontist group and layperson group, 4 mm in general dentist group, and chin protrusion reached 6 mm in all groups（VAS scores <5）. There was no significant difference in the scores among orthodontists, general dentists and laypeople with the variance of chin prominence, and there was no significant difference in gender and age. CONCLUSIONS: Chin prominence had significant effect on facial aesthetics. Soft tissue pogonion point located on the zero meridian was considered as the most attractive. Treatment needs increased significantly when chin protrusion reached 6 mm or chin retrusion exceeded 6 mm. There was no significant difference in the assessment among orthodontists, general dentists and laypeople.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#8707,Correlation between Corneal Endothelial Cell Loss and Location of Phacoemulsification Incision,"PURPOSE: To assess the relationship between corneal endothelial cell loss after phacoemulsification and the location of the clear corneal incision. METHODS: A total of 92 patients (92 eyes) with senile cataracts who met the study criteria were included in this cross sectional study and underwent phacoemulsification. The incision site was determined based on the steep corneal meridian according to preoperative keratometry. Endothelial cell density was measured using specular microscopy in the center and 3 mm from the center of the cornea in the meridian of the incisions (temporal, superior, and superotemporal). Phacoemulsification was performed by a single surgeon using the phaco chop technique through a 3.2 mm clear cornea incision. Endothelial cell loss (ECL) was evaluated 1 week, and 1 and 3 months postoperatively. RESULTS: At all time points during follow-up, ECL was comparable among the 3 incision sites, both in the central cornea and in the meridian of the incision (P > 0.05 for all comparisons). However, 3 months postoperatively, mean central ECL with superior incisions and mean sectoral ECL with temporal incisions were slightly higher. Superotemporal incisions entailed slightly less ECL than the other 2 groups. Overall, one month after surgery, mean central ECL was 10.8% and mean ECL in the sector of the incisions was 14.0%. Axial length and effective phaco time (EFT) were independent predictors of postoperative central ECL (P values 0.005 and < 0.0001, respectively). CONCLUSION: A superotemporal phacoemulsification incision may entail less ECL as compared to other incisions (although not significantly different). The amount of central ECL may be less marked in patients with longer axial lengths and with procedures utilizing less EFT.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No

METHODS: A total of 20 participants (11 men, 9 women; mean age, 32.3 years) were recruited. Four different types of soft contact lenses were randomly fitted to both eyes of each subject on two separate visits. After 30 minutes, the horizontal meridians of the corneal center, midperiphery, and limbus were imaged by UHR-OCT. UL-OCT imaged each lens in vitro and the ocular surface of a physical model eye. RESULTS: Angle-edged lenses had significantly less conjunctival buildup than did round-edged lenses (P = 0.008). Limbal post-lens tear film gaps were present in 42% of the eyes, with the round-edged lenses having the most at 68%. Similarly, post-lens tear film gaps at the corneal mid-periphery were present in 47% of all eyes, with the round-edged lens having the most at 75%. Mismatches between the lens and the ocular surface were simulated based on UL-OCT images of the in vitro lenses and the model eye. The existence of tear film gaps and touching points were predicted in the simulation. CONCLUSIONS: The soft contact lens edge fitting was characterized by the conjunctival buildup and tear film gaps. Different types of contact lenses presented different levels of conjunctival buildup as well as different frequencies of tear film gaps. The findings by UHR-OCT were predicted in the simulation by UL-OCT. The application of these new technologies may open new ways of designing lenses and evaluating their fit.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#8732,Comparison of outcome between small incision lenticule extraction and FS-LASIK in eyes having refractive error greater than negative 10 diopters,"PURPOSE: To compare small incision lenticule extraction (SMILE) and femtosecond laser-assisted laser in situ keratomileusis (FS-LASIK) in terms of safety, refractive outcomes, visual quality, and biomechanical responses in correcting myopia with maximum myopic meridian exceeding 10 diopters (D). SETTING: Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Sun Yat-sen University. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, comparative study. METHODS: The study comprised 60 eyes (60 patients) with a maximum myopic meridian exceeding 10 D; 30 eyes were corrected using SMILE and 30 eyes were corrected using FS-LASIK. Patients received preoperative and 6-month postoperative examinations, including refractive outcomes, corneal curve, contrast sensitivity, ocular aberrometry, and corneal biomechanical responses. RESULTS: At 6 months postoperatively, the uncorrected distance visual acuity was -0.01 ± 0.06 and -0.05 ± 0.10 in the SMILE and LASIK eyes, respectively (P = .08). The corrected distance visual acuity was -0.07 ± 0.07 and -0.08 ± 0.08 (P = .624), respectively. The postoperative spherical equivalent (SE) was -0.20 ± 0.25 D and -0.03 ± 0.20 D, respectively (P = .008). The posterior corneal curvature was unchanged after SMILE and FS-LASIK (P > .05). The measured corneal thickness was reduced by 137.40 ± 15.01 μm and 155.06 ± 17.43 μm (P < .001). The change in the SE was -0.01 ± 0.26 and -0.13 ± 0.30 from 1 week (P = .103). Only the peak distance (the distance between the highest points of the nondeformed corneal parts) differed between the groups (1.06 ± 1.44 mm vs -0.26 ± 1.16 mm, P = .007). In the SMILE patients, changes in higher-order aberration (P = .018) and spherical aberration (P = .011) were smaller than in LASIK patients. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with LASIK, SMILE might offer superior safety and objective visual quality, comparable stability and efficacy, and a little inferior predictability in correcting maximum myopic meridian exceeding 10 D.",No,No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No
#8739,Phacoemulsification With 3.0 and 2.0 mm Opposite Clear Corneal Incisions for Correction of Corneal Astigmatism,"PURPOSE: To compare the effect of 3.0 and 2.0 mm opposite clear corneal incisions (OCCIs) in phacoemulsification on reduction of preexisting corneal astigmatism, and their impact on corneal aberrations. METHODS: This study is a prospective randomized controlled study that included 140 patients with age-related cataract and regular corneal astigmatism ≥0.75 diopter (D). Phacoemulsification was performed using on-meridian 3.0 or 2.0 mm corneal incision with or without an OCCI. Cases were divided into 4 groups: 3.0 mm OCCIs, 3.0 mm single clear corneal incision (3.0 mm SCCI), 2.0 mm OCCIs, and 2.0 mm SCCI. Keratometry and topography were performed at 3 months postoperatively. The variations in corneal astigmatism and aberrations were recorded. Surgically induced astigmatism was calculated using vector analysis. RESULTS: The corneal astigmatism reduction was 0.61 ± 0.38 D in the 3.0 mm OCCIs group, significantly higher than the other groups (P ≤ 0.004); and 0.29 ± 0.29 D in the 2.0 mm OCCIs group. The mean surgically induced astigmatism was 1.07 ± 0.51 D in the 3.0 mm OCCIs group, higher than 0.61 ± 0.35 D in the 2.0 mm OCCIs group (P = 0.001). The root mean square values of corneal trefoil, spherical aberration, and total higher order aberrations increased at 3 months postoperatively, but there were no significant differences between OCCI and SCCI groups. CONCLUSIONS: On-meridian 3.0 mm OCCIs are effective for correcting mild-to-moderate corneal astigmatism during cataract surgery, exerting no additional impact on corneal aberration compared with SCCI.",No,No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No
#8753,Alterations of the Ganglion Cell Complex in Age-Related Macular Degeneration: An Amish Eye Study Analysis,"PURPOSE: To compare the ganglion cell complex (GCC) thickness in eyes with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) vs healthy controls in an elderly Amish population. DESIGN: Prospective cross-sectional study. METHODS: This is a post hoc analysis of the family-based prospective study of Amish subjects. Study subjects underwent imaging with the Cirrus HD-OCT (Carl Zeiss Meditec Inc) using a macular cube protocol of 512 × 128 scans (128 horizontal B-scans, each comprising 512 A-scans) over a 6 mm × 6 mm region centered on the fovea. The ganglion cell analysis algorithm calculated the GCC thickness by segmenting the outer boundaries of the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and inner plexiform layer (IPL) in all B-scans of the volume, with the region between these boundaries representing the combined thickness of the ganglion cell layer (GCL) and the IPL. A number of parameters were used to evaluate the GCC thickness: the average GCC thickness, minimum (lowest GCC thickness at a single meridian crossing the elliptical annulus), and sectoral (within each of 6 sectoral areas: superior, superotemporal, superonasal, inferior, inferonasal, and inferotemporal). The stage of AMD was graded on color fundus photographs in accordance with the Beckman Initiative for Macular Research classification system. RESULTS: Of 1339 subjects enrolled in the Amish eye study, a total of 1294 eyes of 1294 subjects had all required imaging studies of sufficient quality and were included in the final analysis. Of these, 798 (62%) were female. Following age adjustment, the average GCC thickness was significantly (P < .001) thinner in AMD subjects (73.71 ± SD; 13.77 µm) compared to normals (77.97 ± 10.42 µm). An independent t test showed that the early AMD (75.03 ± 12.45 µm) and late AMD (61.64 ± 21.18 µm) groups (among which eyes with geographic atrophy [GA] had the lowest thickness, of 58.10 ± 20.27 µm) had a statistically significant lower GCC thickness compared to eyes without AMD. There was no significant differences in average GCC thickness between early AMD and intermediate AMD (76.36 ± 9.25 µm) eyes. CONCLUSIONS: The GCC thickness in AMD eyes is reduced compared to normal eyes; however, the relationship is complex, with the greatest reduction in late AMD eyes (particularly eyes with GA) but no difference between early and intermediate AMD eyes.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#8765,Three Methods for Correction of Astigmatism during Phacoemulsification,"PURPOSE: To compare the safety and efficacy of three methods for correcting pre-existing astigmatism during phacoemulsification. METHODS: This prospective, comparative, non-randomized study was conducted from March 2010 to January 2011, and included patients with keratometric astigmatism ≥1.25 D undergoing cataract surgery. Astigmatism was corrected using the following approaches: limbal relaxing incisions (LRI) on the steep meridian, extension and suturing of the phaco incision created at the steep meridian (extended-on-axis incision, EOAI), and toric intraocular lens (tIOL) implantation. Keratometric and refractive astigmatism were evaluated 1, 8, and 24 weeks postoperatively. RESULTS: Eighty-three eyes of 72 patients (35 male and 37 female) with mean age of 62.4 ± 14.3 (range, 41-86) years were enrolled. The astigmatism was corrected by using the LRI, EOAI and tIOL implantation methods in 17, 33 and 33 eyes, respectively. Postoperative uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA) was significantly improved in all three groups. The difference in postoperative UDVA was not statistically significant among the study groups throughout follow-up except at week 24, when UCVA was significantly better in the tIOL group as compared to the EOAI group (P = 0.024). There is no statistically significant difference of correction index and index of success between three groups at week 24 (P = 0.085 and P = 0.085 respectively). CONCLUSION: There was no significant difference in astigmatism reduction among the three methods of astigmatism correction during phacoemulsification. Each of these methods can be used at the discretion of the surgeon.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#8787,Effect of acupuncture on symptoms of anxiety in women undergoing in vitro fertilisation: a prospective randomised controlled study,"PURPOSE: To determine if acupuncture improves symptoms of anxiety in infertile women undergoing in vitro fertilisation (IVF) treatment. METHODS: A randomised clinical trial was performed in 43 patients undergoing IVF. The patients were randomised into two groups: test group (n=22) and control group (n=21). The anxiety level of each patient was analysed before and after treatment using the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAS). Treatment sessions consisted of four weekly sessions. In the test group, needles were inserted at points HT7, PC6, CV17, GV20 and Yintang. In the control group, needles were inserted in areas near but not corresponding to acupuncture points. RESULTS: The mean HAS score after the 4-week experimental period was significantly lower in the test group than in the control group (19.4 ± 3.2 vs 24.4 ± 4.2; p=0.0008). CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that acupuncture can reduce anxiety symptoms observed by the reduction of psychological parameters of women undergoing IVF. Further evidence should be sought as to whether acupuncture might be a complementary option for patients undergoing IVF.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes
#8789,"Physiotherapist-delivered cognitive-behavioural interventions are effective for low back pain, but can they be replicated in clinical practice? A systematic review","PURPOSE: To determine if physiotherapist-led cognitive-behavioural (CB) interventions are effective for low back pain (LBP) and described sufficiently for replication. METHOD: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of patients with LBP treated by physiotherapists using a CB intervention were included. Outcomes of disability, pain, and quality of life were assessed using the GRADE approach. Intervention reporting was assessed using the Template for Intervention Description and Replication. RESULTS: Of 1898 titles, 5 RCTs (n = 1390) were identified. Compared to education and/or exercise interventions, we found high-quality evidence that CB had a greater effect (SMD; 95% CI) on reducing disability (-0.19; -0.32, -0.07), pain (-0.21; -0.33, -0.09); and moderate-quality evidence of little difference in quality of life (-0.06; -0.18 to 0.07). Sufficient information was provided on dose, setting, and provider; but not content and procedural information. Studies tended to report the type of CB component used (e.g., challenging unhelpful thoughts) with little detail on how it was operationalised. Moreover, access to treatment manuals, patient materials and provider training was lacking. CONCLUSIONS: With additional training, physiotherapists can deliver effective CB interventions. However, without training or resources, successful translation and implementation remains unlikely. Researchers should improve reporting of procedural information, provide relevant materials, and offer accessible provider training. Implications for Rehabilitation Previous reviews have established that traditional biomedical-based treatments (e.g., acupuncture, manual therapy, massage, and specific exercise programmes) that focus only on physical symptoms do provide short-term benefits but the sustained effect is questionable. A cognitive-behavioural (CB) approach includes techniques to target both physical and psychosocial symptoms related to pain and provides patients with long-lasting skills to manage these symptoms on their own. This combined method has been used in a variety of settings delivered by different health care professionals and has been shown to produce long-term effects on patient outcomes. What has been unclear is if these programmes are effective when delivered by physiotherapists in routine physiotherapy settings. Our study synthesises the evidence for this context. We have confirmed with high-quality evidence that with additional training, physiotherapists can deliver CB interventions that are effective for patients with back pain. Physiotherapists who are considering enhancing their treatment for patients with low back pain should consider undertaking some additional training in how to incorporate CB techniques into their practice to optimise treatment benefits and help patients receive long-lasting treatment effects. Importantly, our results indicate that using a CB approach, including a variety of CB techniques that could be easily adopted in a physical therapy setting, provides greater benefits for patient outcomes compared to brief education, exercise or physical techniques (such as manual therapy) alone. This provides further support that a combined treatment approach is likely better than one based on physical techniques alone. Notably, we identified a significant barrier to adopting any of these CB interventions in practice. This is because no study provided a description of the intervention or accessible training materials that would allow for accurate replication. Without access to provider training and/or resources, we cannot expect this evidence to be implemented in practice with optimal effects. Thus, we would urge physiotherapists to directly contact authors of the studies for more information on how to incorporate their interventions into their settings.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#8800,The effect of auricular acupuncture on preoperative blood pressure across age groups: a prospective randomized controlled trial,"PURPOSE: To determine the effect of auricular acupuncture on preoperative blood pressure (BP) elevation in different age groups. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Auricular acupuncture treats elevated BP among patients before surgery. This prospective, randomized clinical trial was performed at Li Huili Hospital of Ningbo Medical Center, China, from January to June 2021. We prospectively enrolled 120 patients with elevated BP aged 45 to 75 and observed them in the inpatient department. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to undergo auricular acupuncture or sham control groups. In addition to usual care, the study group underwent auricular acupuncture bilaterally at HX6 7i-Ear apex, TF4-Shen men, TF1-Superior triangular fossa, and CO15-Heart. RESULTS: A total of 120 patients completed the study, 60 in the study group and 60 in the control group. Of these, 76 (63.3%) were men, and the mean (standard deviation) was 64.55 (9.48) years. The differences in systolic BP comparisons after intervention were significant (7.88 mmHg; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.94 to 12.81; P = .002). Diastolic BP also showed statistical significance (5.85 mmHg; 95% CI, 3.05 to 8.64; P < .01. Neither AA-related adverse events nor serious adverse events occurred. Stratified by age, the differences comparisons of systolic BP (-10.13 mmHg; 95% confidence interval [CI], -16.69 to -3.57; P < .01) and diastolic BP (-7.65 mmHg; 95% confidence interval [CI], -11.17 to -4.14; P < .01) were statistically significant for participants aged 60-75 years; The differences comparison of systolic BP (-2.37 mmHg; 95% confidence interval [CI], -8.04 to 3.31; P = .40) and diastolic BP (-1.46 mmHg; 95% confidence interval [CI], -5.68 to 2.76; P = .48) were not significant aged 45-59. CONCLUSION: Auricular acupuncture can reduce BP before procedures. However, further research is needed on the antihypertensive effect on people aged 45-59. These findings provide clinicians with evidence of auricular acupuncture as a standard adjunctive therapy targeting this patient population.",No,No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No
#8830,Scleral contact lens thickness profiles: The relationship between average and centre lens thickness,"PURPOSE: To develop a methodology to reliably determine the thickness profile of scleral contact lenses and examine the relationship between the centre and average lens thickness for a range of lens designs and back vertex powers. METHODS: High-resolution images of 37 scleral trial lenses (Epicon LC, Rose K2 XL and ICD 16.5) were captured using an optical coherence tomographer, and their thickness profiles were generated after correcting for known measurement artefacts. Centre lens thickness values were compared with manual lens gauge measurements, and repeatability was assessed by comparing average thickness values derived from orthogonal meridians of each lens. RESULTS: The imaging technique displayed a high level of agreement with a manual lens gauge for centre thickness measurements; mean difference 5 ± 9 μm (95% LoA -14 to +23 μm), and a very high level of repeatability; mean difference between orthogonal meridians 1 ± 3 μm (95% LoA -6 to +8 μm). Lens thickness profiles varied between lens designs, with distance from the lens centre, and with back vertex power. Increasing back vertex powers resulted in a significant over or underestimation (up to 33% for high minus powers) of the average lens thickness based on the centre lens thickness. CONCLUSIONS: The thickness of scleral contact lenses varies with distance from the lens centre and the back vertex power. The average lens thickness value derived from the entire lens provides a more appropriate representation of the true lens thickness and should be used in the calculation of scleral lens oxygen transmissibility.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#8845,Hydrophobic versus double-square-edged hydrophilic foldable acrylic intraocular lens: effect on posterior capsule opacification,"PURPOSE: To evaluate posterior capsule opacification (PCO) 2 years after cataract surgery with implantation of a hydrophobic acrylic or single-piece sharp-edged hydrophilic acrylic intraocular lens (IOL). SETTING: Toyama Prefectural Central Hospital, Toyama, Japan. DESIGN: Case-control study. METHODS: Patients with bilateral senile cataract were prospectively randomized to receive a hydrophobic IOL (Acrysof SA60AT) in 1 eye and a hydrophilic IOL (Meridian HP60M) in the other eye. The PCO density value, degree of IOL decentration and tilt, and anterior chamber depth (ACD) were measured using Scheimpflug videophotography 1, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after surgery. Visual acuity and the number of eyes requiring neodymium:YAG laser capsulotomy were also assessed. RESULTS: The study evaluated 16 eyes (63 patients). The PCO value in the hydrophilic group increased significantly with time and was statistically significantly greater than in the hydrophobic group 18 and 24 months postoperatively (both P < .001). The capsulotomy rate was statistically significantly higher in the hydrophilic group than in the hydrophobic group (P < .01). Visual acuity in the hydrophilic group worsened significantly with time and was statistically significantly worse than in the hydrophobic group at 18 and 24 months (both P < .001). Intraocular lens decentration, IOL tilt, and the ACD did not change significantly during the follow-up in either group (P > .05), and there were no statistically significant postoperative differences in these parameters between the 2 IOL groups (P > .05). CONCLUSION: Two years after surgery, the hydrophobic IOL group had less PCO, a lower capsulotomy rate, and better visual acuity than the hydrophilic IOL group.

#8859,The Effectiveness and Safety of Acupoint Catgut Embedding for the Treatment of Postmenopausal Osteoporosis: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of acupoint catgut embedding therapy (ACET) in postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMOP). METHODS: Review of some databases from their inception to June 2018 and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in which ACET with PMOP were included. Two researchers extracted and evaluated the information independently. Cochrane Collaboration's tool and Jadad scale were used to evaluate the quality of the studies. RevMan V.5.3.3 software was used to carry out the meta-analysis while trial sequential analysis (TSA) performed with TSA 0.9 software. RESULTS: 12 RCTs with 876 participants were included in this review. Meta-analysis showed that ACET alone was not superior to medication in effectiveness rate (RR= 1.11; 95% CI (0.89, 1.40); P=0.35) and E2 (SMD= 0.20; 95% CI (-0.17, 0.57); P=0.28; I (2) =20%) while ACET combining medication was more effective on the effectiveness rate (RR= 1.32; 95% CI (1.20, 1.46); P<0.000 01) and E2 (SMD= 1.24; 95% CI (0.63, 1.84); P<0.0001). Additionally, ACET combining calcium could increase the bone mineral density (BMD) of the L2~4 vertebrae and femur-neck [WMD(L2~4) = 0.03; 95% CI (0.01, 0.05); P=0.003; and WMD(Femur-neck) = 0.07; 95% CI (0.03, 0.10); P = 0.0006], reduce TCM syndrome score [WMD = -1.85; 95% CI (-2.13, -1.57); P<0.000 01], improve patient's quality of life [WMD(three  months) = 6.90; 95% CI (3.90, 9.89); P<0.000 01; and WMD(six  months) = 12.34; 95% CI (5.09, 19.60); P=0.0009], and relieve pain [WMD(VAS) = -1.26; 95% CI (-1.66, -0.85); P<0.000 01; and WMD(Pain  score) = -2.59; 95% CI (-4.76, -0.43); P= 0.02]. The TSA showed that the effectiveness of ACET for PMOP was demonstrated accurately. CONCLUSIONS: ACET combining medication but not ACET alone is more effective than medication as comparison in the treatment of PMOP. As a novel treatment, ACET shows the potential of effectiveness and deserves further high quality of well-designed study.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#8871,Intraoperative arcuate transverse keratotomy with phacoemulsification,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy of paired intraoperative arcuate transverse keratotomy at a 7-mm-diameter zone along with a 3.5-mm clear corneal phaco tunnel in the steeper axis to correct pre-existing astigmatism. METHODS: A prospective randomized case-control study was conducted on 34 eyes of 28 patients with immature senile cataract. They were divided into two groups; in one group (17 eyes) intraoperative arcuate keratotomy was coupled with phacoemulsification in the steeper meridian (arcuate keratotomy group; mean preoperative astigmatism 2.28 +/- 0.89 D) and the other group (17 eyes) phacoemulsification was performed in the steeper meridian without arcuate keratotomy (control group; mean preoperative astigmatism 2.04 +/- 0.50 D). The patients were examined at 1 day, and 1, 4, and 8 weeks postoperatively. Correction of keratometric astigmatism, surgically induced refractive changes, magnitude and axis of cylinder, spherical equivalent refraction, with and against the wound change, and coupling ratio were evaluated. RESULTS: Mean reduction in keratometric astigmatism in the keratotomy group was 1.26 +/- 0.54 D (P = .0067) and in the control group was 0.48 +/- 0.60 D (P = .0423). The difference in reduction of keratometric astigmatism between the two groups was statistically significant (P = .0296). Surgically induced refractive change at 8 weeks follow-up was 2.15 +/- 1.13 D in the keratotomy group and 1.50 +/- 1.32 D in the control group (P = .046). Coupling ratio was -1.10 +/- 0.43 in the keratotomy group at 8 weeks after surgery while the control group was -0.82 +/- 0.38. CONCLUSION: A combination of intraoperative arcuate keratotomy with steep axis phacoemulsification incision is more effective than steep axis phacoemulsification incision alone in reducing pre-existing astigmatism.",No,No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No
#8908,[Clinical observation of acupuncture and massage therapy for temporomandibular joint disorders],"PURPOSE: To explore simple and effective treatment method for temporomandibular joint disorders by investigating 96 temporomandibular joint disorder patients using electroacupuncture pulse stimulation and massage therapy. METHODS: Ninety-six patients with temporomandibular joint disorder including 54 patients with myofacial pain and 42 patients with external pterygoid muscle spasm, were invloved and then divided into electroacupuncture group and massage combined with electroacupuncture group equally and randomly, with 48 cases in each group. Patients in the electroacupuncture group only received electroacupuncture pulse stimulation therapy alone at the acupoints in the affected sides, including Shangguan, Xiaguan, Jiache, Tinggong and Hegu acupoint. Patients in the massage combined with electroacupuncture group underwent both electroacupuncture pulse stimulation and massage therapy. Acupoints stimulated in the two groups were same. The therapeutic effect in the two groups was compared using SPSS11.0 software package. RESULTS: The therapeutic effect of massage combined with electroacupuncture pulse stimulation therapy was more effective than electroacupuncture pulse stimulation therapy alone, especially for the patients at early stage of myofacial pain. CONCLUSIONS: Electroacupuncture pulse stimulation combined with massage therapy has a good therapeutic effect on early temporomandibular joint disorders.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No
#8917,Surgical Treatment of Epiblepharon Effectively Alleviates Keratopathy but Not Astigmatism: A Case-Control Study Utilizing Vector Analysis in East Asian Children,"PURPOSE: To identify an appropriate surgical indication of epiblepharon by comparing keratopathy and astigmatism outcomes after surgical and medical treatments for epiblepharon in Asian children. METHODS: Children diagnosed with epiblepharon (n = 82, age 5.93 ± 2.76 years) with >6 months of follow-up were enrolled. The clinical presentations and cycloplegic refractive status at the baseline and 3 and 6 months after treatment were compared between surgical (91 eyes from 47 children) and nonsurgical (67 eyes from 35 children) groups. The refractive and keratometric astigmatism at each time point were evaluated with vector analysis methods. For Thibos and Horner's method, the astigmatic power vector was decomposed into horizontal and oblique meridians (J (0) and J (45)). However, the treatment-induced astigmatism (TIA) vectors were calculated by Alpins' method and depicted by the AstigMATIC software. RESULTS: In the surgical and nonsurgical groups, the baseline astigmatism magnitude was similar (2.22 ± 1.39 and 2.26 ± 1.46 D, p = 0.87). The rate of complete resolution of keratopathy at 6 months was 71.4% and 11.5%. The astigmatism magnitude in the surgical group differed among baseline and 3 months (2.25 ± 1.23 D) and 6 months postoperatively (1.97 ± 1.28 D) (p = 0.001). Power vector analyses confirmed a nuanced against-the-rule shift in the surgical group. This trend was especially observed in the subgroup of baseline astigmatism >2.0 D. However, the difference in the astigmatism magnitude between surgical and nonsurgical groups, even in highly astigmatic children, was not significant at 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: The improvement of keratopathy in the surgical group was greater than that in the nonsurgical group in consideration of the more advanced severity in the surgery group at baseline. Decreased with-the-rule astigmatism can be observed at 6 months postoperatively, particularly among those with greater baseline astigmatism. However, the amount of change is small, and the outcome does not differ significantly from the nonsurgical treatment. Therefore, surgical indications should majorly base on the severity of symptoms and keratopathy.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#8919,Influence of ocular features and incision width on surgically induced astigmatism after cataract surgery,"PURPOSE: To identify factors associated with surgically induced astigmatism (SIA) following phacoemulsification. METHODS: Six hundred five eyes underwent phacoemulsification with a 2.2-mm (the 2.2-mm group, n = 248) or 2.75-mm (the 2.75-mm group, n = 357) superior limbal incision. Preoperative axial length, anterior chamber depth, corneal curvature, and intra-ocular pressure were measured. Corneal curvature and intraocular pressure were measured at 1 day, 1 week, and 1, 2, and 3 months postoperatively. SIA, corneal flattening, and torque were calculated using the Alpins method. The effect of preoperative corneal astigmatism meridian on SIA was also examined. Differences in SIA between the 2.2- and 2.75-mm groups were explored, and correlations between SIA and preoperative corneal astigmatism, anterior chamber depth, axial length, age, and intraocular pressure were analyzed. RESULTS: SIA, corneal flattening, and torque were smaller in the 2.2-mm group than in the 2.75-mm group at 1 week (P = .003, .006, and .014, respectively), but not statistically different thereafter. Higher preoperative corneal astigmatism, older age, and shallower anterior chamber depth were associated with greater SIA in both groups. The effect of astigmatism meridian on SIA was more noticeable in the 2.75-mm group. Shorter axial length and lower intraocular pressures were associated with greater SIA in the 2.75-mm group but not in the 2.2-mm group. CONCLUSIONS: Reducing limbal incision width and considering patient age, the meridian and magnitude of corneal astigmatism, anterior chamber depth, axial length, and intraocular pressure, and adjusting the flattening component of SIA input for toric intraocular lens power calculation could potentially improve the astigmatism control in refractive lens surgery.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#8923,Can manipulation of orthokeratology lens parameters modify peripheral refraction?,"PURPOSE: To investigate changes in peripheral refraction, corneal topography, and aberrations induced by changes in orthokeratology (OK) lens parameters in myopes. METHODS: Subjects were fitted with standard OK lenses that were worn overnight for 2 weeks. Peripheral refraction, corneal topography, and corneal surface aberrations were measured at baseline and after 14 nights of OK lens wear. Subsequent to a 2-week washout period, subjects were refitted with another set of lenses where one eye was randomly assigned to wear an OK lens with a smaller optic zone diameter (OZD) and the other eye with a steeper peripheral tangent. Measurements were taken again at a second baseline and after 14 days of overnight wear of the second OK lens set. RESULTS: Standard OK lenses with a 6-mm OZD and 1/4 peripheral tangent caused significant changes in both peripheral refraction and corneal topography. Significant hyperopic shift occurred in the central visual field (VF) while a myopic shift was found at 35 degrees in the nasal VF. OK induced significant reductions in corneal power at all positions along the horizontal corneal chord except at 2.4 mm nasal where there was no significant change and at 2.8 mm nasal where there was an increase in corneal refractive power. A positive shift in spherical aberration was induced for all investigated lens designs except for the 1/2 tangent design when calculated over a 4-mm pupil. Reducing OZD and steepening the peripheral tangent did not cause significant changes in peripheral refraction or corneal topography profiles across the horizontal meridian. CONCLUSIONS: OK lenses caused significant changes in peripheral refraction, corneal topography, and corneal surface aberrations. Modifying OZD and peripheral tangent made no significant difference to the peripheral refraction or corneal topography profile. Attempting to customize refraction and topography changes through manipulation of OK lens parameters appears to be a difficult task.",No,No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No
#8929,Corneal topography with an aberrometry-topography system,"PURPOSE: To investigate the agreement between the central corneal radii and corneal eccentricity measurements generated by the new Wave Analyzer 700 Medica (WAV) compared to the Keratograph 4 (KER) and to test the repeatability of the instruments. METHODS: 20 subjects (10 male, mean age 29.1 years, range 21-50 years) were recruited from the students and staff of the Cologne School of Optometry. Central corneal radii for the flat (r(c/fl)) and steep (r(c/st)) meridian as well as corneal eccentricity for the nasal (e(nas)), temporal (e(temp)), inferior (e(inf)) and superior (e(sup)) directions were measured using WAV and KER by one examiner in a randomized order. RESULTS: Central radii of the flat (r(c/fl)) and steep (r(c/st)) meridian measured with both instruments were statically significantly correlated (r = 0.945 and r = 0.951; p < 0.001). Comparison between the WAV and KER showed that r(c/fl) and r(c/st) measured with WAV were significantly steeper than those measured with KER (p < 0.001). Corneal eccentricities were statistically significantly correlated in all meridians (p < 0.05). Compared to KER, e(temp) and e(sup) measured with WAV were greater (p < 0.05), while there were no statistically significant differences for e(nas) and e(inf) (p = 0.350 and p = 0.083). For the central radii, repeated measurements were not significantly different for the KER or WAV (p > 0.05). Limits of agreement (LoA) indicate a better repeatability for the KER compared to WAV. CONCLUSIONS: Corneal topography measurements captured with the WAV were strongly correlated with the KER. However, due to the differences in measured corneal radii and eccentricities, the devices cannot be used interchangeably. For corneal topography the KER demonstrated better repeatability.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#8976,Ultraviolet photography of the in vivo human cornea unmasks the Hudson-Stähli line and physiologic vortex patterns,"PURPOSE: To perform ultraviolet (UV) macrophotography of the normal in vivo human cornea, establishing biometric data of the major component of UV absorption for comparison with the Hudson-Stähli (HS) line, the distribution of iron demonstrated by Perl stain, and cases of typical amiodarone keratopathy. METHODS: Nonrandomized comparative case series of UV photographs of 76 normal corneas (group 1) and 16 corneas with typical amiodarone keratopathy (group 2). Image-analysis software was used to grade the major component of UV absorption for slope and the coordinates of its points of intersection with the vertical corneal meridian and inflection. RESULTS: In group 1 the major component had a mean slope of 5.8 degrees, sloping down from nasal to temporal cornea. The mean coordinates of points of intersection with the vertical corneal meridian and inflection were (0, 0.30) and (0.02, 0.31), respectively. No significant differences between groups 1 and 2 were found for slope (P = 0.155), intersection with the vertical corneal meridian (P = 0.517), and point of inflection (P = 0.344). The major component of UV absorption was consistent with published characteristics of the HS line, and coincidence of UV absorption and Perl-stained iron was demonstrated in one corneal button. A vortex pattern of UV absorption was observed in all corneas. CONCLUSIONS: UV photography demonstrates subclinical corneal iron, confirming its deposition in an integrated HS line/vortex pattern. Coincident iron and amiodarone deposition occurs in amiodarone keratopathy.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#8983,Quantitative analysis of retinal nerve fiber layer defect in early open-angle glaucoma with normal intraocular pressure,"PURPOSE: To quantitatively analyze the topographic features of localized retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) defects according to baseline intraocular pressure (IOP) level in cases of early primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective comparative study. METHODS: POAG patients meeting the following conditions were consecutively included: (1) baseline office-hour diurnal IOP ≤ 21 mmHg, (2) 1 localized RNFL defect as observed on red-free fundus photography, and (3) corresponding visual field defect. Defects' approximations to the macula (angle α) and width (angle ß) as well as the angle between the disc long axis and the vertical meridian line (angle Ɣ) were measured on red-free fundus photography. The corrected angle α was calculated as the difference between angles α and Ɣ. The defect area's RNFL thickness was calculated by means of optical coherence tomography's Advanced Extraction analysis utility. RESULTS: Comparative analysis was performed between 2 groups: 45 eyes of 45 patients with low-teen IOP (group A: highest IOP ≤ 15 mmHg) and 49 eyes of 49 patients with high-teen IOP (group B: lowest IOP > 15 mmHg). In group A, the mean baseline IOP was lower (12.9 ± 1.3 vs 17.1 ± 1.0 mmHg; P < .001), the corrected angle α was smaller (32.4 ± 15.1 vs 39.5 ± 13.1 degrees; P = .017), and the defect area's RNFL thickness was thinner (66.3 ± 16.8 vs 76.3 ± 14.9 μm; P = .003) than in group B; angle ß showed no intergroup difference (P = .230). CONCLUSIONS: In POAG patients with low-teen IOP relative to those with high-teen IOP, localized RNFL defects were closer to the macula. In addition, the RNFL thickness of the defect area was markedly thinner.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#8998,Effect of instrument rotation on handheld keratometry,"PURPOSE: To study the effect of instrument rotation on handheld automated keratometry. SETTING: Department of Optometry and Radiography, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong SAR, China. METHODS: In 33 recruited subjects, corneal curvature in 1 eye (randomly selected) was measured using a Medmont topographic keratometer and a Nidek handheld keratometer. In handheld keratometry, measurements were obtained holding the instrument in the upright position and rotating it anticlockwise 5 degrees, 10 degrees, and 15 degrees and then clockwise 5 degrees, 10 degrees, and 15 degrees. The sequence of measurements was randomly assigned. The steepest and flattest corneal curvatures as well as the axis along the flattest meridian were compared in different conditions. The corneal power was converted to vector representation (M, J0, J45) for a second comparison. RESULTS: There was a significant difference in the steepest and flattest curvatures in different conditions (repeated-measures analysis of variation, P<.05). However, the mean difference between handheld and topographic keratometry was approximately 0.25 diopter (D) for the steepest curvature and 0.05 D for the flattest curvature regardless of the direction and amount of rotation. The intraclass correlation coefficients were nearly 1, which indicated good clinical reliability. The mean difference in axis determination followed the direction and amount of rotation. With vector representation, the difference between the devices increased with the amount of rotation, especially J0 and J45. CONCLUSIONS: Handheld keratometry was in agreement with topographic keratometry. However, practitioners should adjust the axis manually according to the direction and amount of rotation. The difference between handheld and topographic keratometry increased with the rotational effect, which was seen with vector representation. Practitioners are advised to use the handheld keratometer in the upright position.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#9010,Screening for previous refractive surgery in eye bank corneas by using optical coherence tomography,"PURPOSE: To use optical coherence tomography (OCT) to detect previous refractive surgery in donor corneas. METHODS: We constructed a tabletop OCT scanner operating at 1310-nm wavelength. Donor corneas at the Cleveland Eye Bank were scanned while sealed within the sterile container immersed in Optisol GS. OCT scanning was performed with 7.6-mm-long lines (512 axial scans) along 8 meridians. Anterior and posterior corneal surfaces were automatically mapped using image processing software that we developed. Curvature was computed from the best parabolic fit in the central 5-mm diameter. Layered analysis of the stromal reflectivity was also performed. Twenty-nine corneas from 19 donors were examined. Five had a history of laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK). RESULTS: The flap interfaces could not be visualized on slit-lamp or OCT images but were confirmed by histology. The death-to-scan time was 22.1 +/- 11.4 (SD) hours for normal corneas and 100.6 +/- 57.5 hours for LASIK corneas. The anterior surface power was 67.5 +/- 2.5 D in control corneas and 64.5 +/- 2.4 D in LASIK corneas (P = 0.023). There was no significance between the 2 groups in terms of posterior curvature and thickness parameters. The anterior/posterior reflectivity ratio in the central 4-mm diameter was significantly lower in post-LASIK corneas than in control (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: OCT provides thickness, topography, and reflectivity maps of donor corneas without taking them out of preservation medium and container. The anterior curvature and the anterior/posterior stromal reflectivity ratio may be useful for detecting previous LASIK.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#9011,Rehabilitation with a combination of scalp acupuncture and exercise therapy in spastic cerebral palsy,"PURPOSE: To use Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and Western approaches to improve gross motor function and activities of daily living (ADL) in children with spastic cerebral palsy. METHODS: Children were randomly divided into a treatment group, which received scalp acupuncture combined with exercise therapy and conventional rehabilitation training, and a control group, which received conventional rehabilitation training alone. Study subjects' gross motor function (gross motor function measure-88 [GMFM-88]) and ADL were evaluated before and after therapy. RESULTS: GMFM-88 and ADL scores were significantly improved in both groups after therapy, but the within group differences in post- and pre-therapy GMFM-88 and ADL scores were significantly higher in the treatment group compared to the control group. CONCLUSION: Scalp acupuncture combined with exercise therapy and conventional rehabilitation training can significantly improve gross motor function and the ability to perform ADLs in children with spastic cerebral palsy compared to conventional rehabilitation training alone.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes
#9026,Clinical Efficacy of Acupuncture in the Treatment of Uterine Contraction Pain Post-Cesarean Section: Protocol of a Randomized Controlled Trial,"PURPOSE: Uterine contraction pain post-cesarean section (UCPCS) is one of the main complaints for mothers in the early stages of the puerperium. Acupuncture, a non-pharmacological therapy, has shown sound analgesic effects with almost no toxic side effects. This study uses acupuncture as an intervention and aimed to provide strong evidence for the clinical efficacy of acupuncture in treating UCPCS. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This single-blind, randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted at the Ludian County Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, China. Participants (138) are randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either an observation or control group following cesarean section. Both groups receive routine postpartum care, the control group with sham acupuncture and the observation group with conventional acupuncture for 3 days. The primary outcome is the mean Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score of the UCPCS. Secondary outcomes include the mean of UCPCS intensity, frequency, total duration, number of days to disappear, amount of vaginal bleeding and lactation, time to first lactation, and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) score. The final results will be analyzed in accordance with the intention-to-treat (ITT) principle using SPSS V.28.0. DISCUSSION: This is the first RCT using non-penetrating sham acupuncture as a control to validate the clinical efficacy of acupuncture for UCPCS. The results of this study are expected to provide an effective therapeutic option for UCPCS, as well as offer clinicians and researchers strong evidence regarding non-pharmacological interventions.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#9033,Acupuncture for cancer-related fatigue in patients with breast cancer: a pragmatic randomized controlled trial,"PURPOSE: We aimed to assess the effectiveness of acupuncture for cancer-related fatigue (CRF) in patients with breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a pragmatic, randomized controlled trial comparing acupuncture with enhanced usual care. Three hundred two outpatients with breast cancer participated. We randomly assigned 75 patients to usual care and 227 patients to acupuncture plus usual care (random assignment of 1:3 respectively) with minimization controlling for baseline general fatigue and maintenance treatment. Treatment was delivered by acupuncturists once a week for 6 weeks through needling three pairs of acupoints. The usual care group received a booklet with information about fatigue and its management. Primary outcome was general fatigue at 6 weeks, measured with the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI). Other measurements included the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General quality-of-life scale, and expectation of acupuncture effect. Analyses were by intention to treat. RESULTS: Two hundred forty-six of 302 patients randomly assigned provided complete data at 6 weeks. The difference in the mean General Fatigue score, between those who received the intervention and those who did not, was -3.11 (95% CI, -3.97 to -2.25; P < .001). The intervention also improved all other fatigue aspects measured by MFI, including Physical Fatigue and Mental Fatigue (acupuncture effect, -2.36 and -1.94, respectively; both at P < .001), anxiety and depression (acupuncture effect, -1.83 and -2.13, respectively; both at P < .001), and quality of life (Physical Well-Being effect, 3.30; Functional Well-Being effect, 3.57; both at P < .001; Emotional Well-Being effect, 1.93; P = .001; and Social Functioning Well-Being effect, 1.05; P < .05). CONCLUSION: Acupuncture is an effective intervention for managing the symptom of CRF and improving patients' quality of life.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,No
#9040,Combined Femtosecond Laser-Assisted Keratotomy and Cataract Surgery for Enhancing Refractive Outcomes. An Indonesian Case Study,"PURPOSE: We evaluate the reduction of corneal astigmatism and the improvement of visual outcomes of this surgical method in the Indonesian population. We also assess the accuracy and predictability of using femtosecond laser astigmatic keratotomy (FLAK) combined with cataract surgery. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a retrospective study, a total of 275 subjects (78 with against-the-rule (ATR) astigmatism, 178 with with-the-rule (WTR) astigmatism, and 19 with oblique (OBL) astigmatism) with preexisting corneal astigmatism ranging from 0.75D to 3.00D underwent FLAK. All subjects completed a 3-month follow-up. The femtosecond laser used for creating paired AK 2.2 mm, primary incision, and paracentesis incision was the FEMTO Z8 NEO from Ziemer Ophthalmic System, Switzerland. The surgical approach was guided by the ""NAPA"" nomogram. RESULTS: The reduction in postoperative astigmatism was 56.90% for the WTR group, 49.46% for the ATR group, and 47.33% for the oblique group. A significant reduction in astigmatism was observed at the 1-week, 1-month, and 3-month follow-up intervals in both the WTR and ATR groups. The reduction in astigmatism was more favorable in cases of moderate astigmatism within the WTR group, as compared to the ATR and oblique groups. Postoperative astigmatism reduction was found to be more predictable in the right eye than in the left eye. CONCLUSION: The combination of FLAK can be considered as a potential method for reducing corneal astigmatism ranging from 1.00D to <3.00D. The highest reduction was observed in the WTR group, along with a higher rate of intended correction without astigmatism meridian shift in the right eye for the WTR group. However, factors such as cyclotorsion resulting from the surgical technique, alignment of docking, incision length, and preoperative astigmatism need to be taken into account for further enhancement and predictability of astigmatism reduction with this method.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#9057,Some physiotherapy treatments may relieve menstrual pain in women with primary dysmenorrhea: a systematic review,"QUESTION: In women with primary dysmenorrhoea, what is the effect of physiotherapeutic interventions compared to control (either no treatment or placebo/sham) on pain and quality of life? DESIGN: Systematic review of randomised trials with meta-analysis. PARTICIPANTS: Women with primary dysmenorrhea. INTERVENTION: Any form of physiotherapy treatment. OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was menstrual pain intensity and the secondary outcome was quality of life. RESULTS: The search yielded 222 citations. Of these, 11 were eligible randomised trials and were included in the review. Meta-analysis revealed statistically significant reductions in pain severity on a 0-10 scale from acupuncture (weighted mean difference 2.3, 95% CI 1.6 to 2.9) and acupressure (weighted mean difference 1.4, 95% CI 0.8 to 1.9), when compared to a control group receiving no treatment. However, these are likely to be placebo effects because when the control groups in acupuncture/acupressure trials received a sham instead of no treatment, pain severity did not significantly differ between the groups. Significant reductions in pain intensity on a 0-10 scale were noted in individual trials of heat (by 1.8, 95% CI 0.9 to 2.7), transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (2.3, 95% CI 0.03 to 4.2), and yoga (3.2, 95% CI 2.2 to 4.2). Meta-analysis of two trials of spinal manipulation showed no significant reduction in pain. None of the included studies measured quality of life. CONCLUSION: Physiotherapists could consider using heat, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, and yoga in the management of primary dysmenorrhea. While benefits were also identified for acupuncture and acupressure in no-treatment controlled trials, the absence of significant effects in sham-controlled trials suggests these effects are mainly attributable to placebo effects.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#9062,Some conservative interventions are more effective than others for people with chronic non-specific neck pain: a systematic review and network meta-analysis,"QUESTION: Which is the most effective conservative intervention for patients with non-specific chronic neck pain (CNSNP)? DESIGN: A systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised clinical trials. PARTICIPANTS: Adults with CNSNP of at least 3 months duration. INTERVENTIONS: All available pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcomes were pain intensity and disability. The secondary outcome was adverse events. RESULTS: Overall, 119 RCTs (12,496 patients; 32 interventions) were included. Risk of bias was low in 50.4% of trials, unclear in 22.7% and high in 26.9%. Compared with inert treatment, a combination of active and/or passive multimodal non-pharmacological inventions (eg, exercise and manual therapy) were effective for pain on a 0-to-10 scale at 1 month (MD range 0.84 to 3.74) and at 3 to 6 months (MD range 1.06 to 1.49), and effective on disability on a 0-to-100 scale at 1 month (MD range 10.26 to 14.09) and 3 to 6 months (MD range 5.60 to 16.46). These effects ranged from possible to definite clinical relevance. Compared with inert treatment, anti-inflammatory drugs alone or in combination with another non-pharmacological treatment did not reduce pain at 1 month or 3 to 6 months. At 12 months, no superiority was found over inert treatment on both outcomes. Most mild adverse events were experienced following acupuncture/dry needling intervention. On average, the evidence varied from low to very low certainty. CONCLUSIONS: While multimodal non-pharmacological interventions may reduce pain and disability for up to 3 to 6 months of follow-up when compared with inert treatment, the evidence was very uncertain about their effects. Better quality and larger trials are needed to improve the certainty of evidence. REGISTRATION: PROSPERO CRD42019124501.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#9078,Fu's subcutaneous needling for intractable hiccups: A case report,"RATIONALE: Intractable hiccups pose a significant impact on patients' quality of life and mental well-being, yet effective nonpharmacological interventions remain limited. Fu's subcutaneous needling (FSN), a novel acupuncture technique targeting myofascial trigger points (MTrPs), has not been previously reported in treating intractable hiccups. PATIENT CONCERNS: The patient developed intractable hiccups (30-40 episodes/min) following treatment for allergic cough, unresponsive to medications and conventional acupuncture. DIAGNOSES: Intractable hiccups. INTERVENTIONS: FSN was applied to MTrPs in rectus abdominis, psoas major, erector spinae, and adductor magnus muscles. The needle was inserted subcutaneously toward tightened muscles, followed by fan-shaped sweeping for 2 minutes per session. OUTCOMES: Hiccup frequency decreased from 6/10 to 1/10 on the Hiccup Assessment Instrument after 7 sessions. Symptoms resolved completely with no recurrence at 1-month follow-up. LESSONS: FSN may be a safe and effective alternative for intractable hiccups by inactivating MTrPs and modulating fascial tension.

#9090,Acupuncture analgesia. I. Review of clinical studies,"Recent clinical studies, both uncontrolled and controlled, of the use of acupuncture for the relief of chronic pain are reviewed. The success rate demonstrated by controlled trials is markedly lower than that claimed in reports of the clinical use of acupuncture in which no attempt is made to control factors which influence the placebo response. Although on balance of evidence it appears that acupuncture has a place in the management of chronic pain resistant to orthodox therapeutic measures, more research is needed both to establish objective criteria for the assessment of the effect, or lack of effect, of acupuncture on chronic pain as well as to delineate clearly the patient groups and the conditions where acupuncture analgesia is indicated.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#9100,[Acupuncture intervention combined with assisted reproductive technology: its different effects at different time points during the in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer course],"Recently the combination of acupuncture with assisted reproductive technology (ART) to increase the outcomes of ART is being widely studied. In this article, the literatures concerning random controlled clinical trials since 2002 are reviewed and the designs of the trials, especially the timing of acupuncture, are evaluated. Over the past 5 years, the related clinical trials have primarily showed that acupuncture done immediately before and after embryo transfer might increase the assisted reproduction rates, but still requiring further high quality trials with large samples; in addition, different stimulation modes could produce different result, and so far there has not been a consensus as to the optimal time-point for the acupuncture intervention during the in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-ET) course. Since the effects of acupuncture change with women's endocrine cycles, it is important and possible to make a breakthrough in ART outcomes if acupuncture is performed at a suitable time point during the cycle of IVF/ET combined with ART.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#9101,[Adequate application of quantitative and qualitative statistic analytic methods in acupuncture clinical trials],"Recently, proper use of the statistical methods in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) randomized controlled trials (RCTs) has received increased attention. Statistical inference based on hypothesis testing is the foundation of clinical trials and evidence-based medicine. In this article, the authors described the methodological differences between literature published in Chinese and Western journals in the design and analysis of acupuncture RCTs and the application of basic statistical principles. In China, qualitative analysis method has been widely used in acupuncture and TCM clinical trials, while the between-group quantitative analysis methods on clinical symptom scores are commonly used in the West. The evidence for and against these analytical differences were discussed based on the data of RCTs assessing acupuncture for pain relief. The authors concluded that although both methods have their unique advantages, quantitative analysis should be used as the primary analysis while qualitative analysis can be a secondary criterion for analysis. The purpose of this paper is to inspire further discussion of such special issues in clinical research design and thus contribute to the increased scientific rigor of TCM research.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No

In order to study the antioxidative capacity of red yeast rice and the effects on electrical potential difference (EPD) of 12 acupuncture meridians, the pH value, oxidation reduction potential (ORP), ABTS, FRAP, T-SOD, and particle size distribution of red yeast rice were analyzed. 20 volunteers were recruited and randomly divided into two groups, the red yeast rice group (10 g red yeast rice and 40 g water) and control CK group (50 g water). The left 12 acupuncture meridians' EPD was real-time monitored. Samples were taken at the 10th minutes. The whole procedure continued for 70 minutes. It is shown that the pH value of the red yeast rice was 4.22, the ORP was 359.63 mV, the ABTS was 0.48 mmol Trolox, the FRAP was 0.08 mmol FeSO(4), the T-SOD was 4.71 U, and the average particle size was 108 nm (7.1%) and 398.1 nm (92.9%).

#9122,The Spatial Niche and Influencing Factors of Desert Rodents,"Resource partitioning may allow species coexistence. Sand dunes in the typical steppe of Alxa Desert Inner Mongolia, China, consisting of desert, shrub, and grass habitats, provide an appropriate system for studies of spatial niche partitioning among small mammals. In this study, the spatial niche characteristics of four rodents, Orientallactaga sibirica, Meriones meridianus, Dipus sagitta, and Phodopus roborovskii, and their responses to environmental changes in the Alxa Desert were studied from 2017 to 2021. Using the capture-mark-recapture method, we tested if desert rodents with different biological characteristics and life history strategies under heterogeneous environmental conditions allocate resources in spatial niches to achieve sympatric coexistence. We investigated the influence of environmental factors on the spatial niche breadth of rodents using random forest and redundancy analyses. We observed that the spatial niche overlap between O. sibirica and other rodents is extremely low (overlap index ≤ 0.14). P. roborovskii had the smallest spatial niche breadth. Spatial niche overlap was observed in two distinct species pairs, M. meridianus and D. sagitta, and P. roborovskii and D. sagitta.

#9143,Methods to Standardize a Multicenter Acupuncture Trial Protocol to Reduce Aromatase Inhibitor-related Joint Symptoms in Breast Cancer Patients,"Robust methods are needed to efficiently conduct large, multisite, randomized, controlled clinical trials of acupuncture protocols. The Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) S1200 trial is a randomized, controlled (i.e., sham-controlled and waitlist-controlled) trial of a standardized acupuncture protocol for treating aromatase inhibitor (AI)-associated arthralgias in early-stage breast cancer patients (n = 228). The primary objective of this study was to determine whether true acupuncture administered twice weekly for 6 weeks, as compared to sham acupuncture or a waitlist control, reduced AI-associated joint pain at 6 weeks as assessed by patient reports. The study was conducted at 11 institutions across the United States. The true acupuncture protocol was developed using a consensus-based process. The true acupuncture and the sham acupuncture protocols each consisted of 12 sessions administered for 6 weeks, followed by one weekly session for 6 weeks. The true acupuncture protocol used standardized protocol points, and the standardized acupoints were tailored to a patient's joint symptoms. The similarly standardized sham acupuncture protocol utilized superficial needling of nonacupoints. Standardized methods were developed to train and monitor acupuncturists and included online and in-person training, study manuals, monthly phone calls, and remote quality assurance monitoring throughout the study period.

#9154,Anatomical and Clinical Characteristics of Scalp Acupuncture Systems: a Scoping Review and Synthesis,"Scalp acupuncture is a therapeutic procedure that involves inserting needles into the scalp to treat various medical conditions, including pain and neurological and psychological disorders. The inter-system variability of scalp acupuncture limits secondary analysis and evidence synthesis, delaying its inclusion into evidence-based healthcare policies and establishment as a treatment intervention recognized by Western medicine. This scoping review aimed to identify the range of scalp acupuncture systems, systematically collect and summarize information on their general, anatomical, and clinical characteristics, and build a framework for understanding scalp acupuncture systems. This review included all English-language publications on scalp acupuncture applied to treat any health condition in humans. Extensive searches were conducted across bibliographic databases, journals, trial registries, and supplementary sources. The detailed general, anatomical, and clinical application characteristics of 19 scalp acupuncture systems were extracted. Data were collected and analyzed using charting and image manipulation software. Framework synthesis was performed using the Standard International Acupuncture Nomenclature Scalp Acupuncture as an a priori framework. The review revealed that the heterogeneity related to scalp acupuncture methods can be attributed to the high variability among the theoretical bases of different systems, intersystem mismatch in anatomical locations of treatment points and areas on the scalp, and inconsistencies in the methods used for locating them. These discrepancies in anatomical and clinical features have limited the synthesis and development of a framework for scalp acupuncture. Discussion and agreement on the anatomical locations of scalp stimulation areas, identification of methods for precise positioning of acupuncture areas on the scalp, and further exploration of theoretical bases will aid in the standardization of scalp acupuncture and improve the quality of research in this area.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#9190,"Predicting the onset of myopia in children by age, sex, and ethnicity: Results from the CLEERE Study","SIGNIFICANCE: Clinicians and researchers would benefit from being able to predict the onset of myopia for an individual child. This report provides a model for calculating the probability of myopia onset, year-by-year and cumulatively, based on results from the largest, most ethnically diverse study of myopia onset in the United States. PURPOSE: This study aimed to model the probability of the onset of myopia in previously nonmyopic school-aged children. METHODS: Children aged 6 years to less than 14 years of age at baseline participating in the Collaborative Longitudinal Evaluation of Ethnicity and Refractive Error (CLEERE) Study who were nonmyopic and less hyperopic than +3.00 D (spherical equivalent) were followed up for 1 to 7 years through eighth grade. Annual measurements included cycloplegic autorefraction, keratometry, ultrasound axial dimensions, and parental report of children's near work and time spent in outdoor and/or sports activities. The onset of myopia was defined as the first visit with at least -0.75 D of myopia in each principal meridian. The predictive model was built using discrete time survival analysis and evaluated with C statistics. RESULTS: The model of the probability of the onset of myopia included cycloplegic spherical equivalent refractive error, the horizontal/vertical component of astigmatism (J0), age, sex, and race/ethnicity. Onset of myopia was more likely with lower amounts of hyperopia and less positive/more negative values of J0. Younger Asian American females had the highest eventual probability of onset, whereas older White males had the lowest. Model performance increased with older baseline age, with C statistics ranging from 0.83 at 6 years of age to 0.92 at 13 years. CONCLUSIONS: The probability of the onset of myopia can be estimated for children in the major racial/ethnic groups within the United States on a year-by-year and cumulative basis up to age 14 years based on a simple set of refractive error and demographic variables.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#9195,Asymmetric Peripheral Refraction Profile in Myopes along the Horizontal Meridian,"SIGNIFICANCE: The investigation of peripheral refraction profiles in Indian myopes showed relative peripheral hyperopic refraction in temporal retina and possible dominant role of hyperopic defocus signals from temporal retina in the development of myopia. PURPOSE: Considering that the peripheral refraction profiles were extensively reported to be associated with the central refractive error and vary among different ethnicities, we investigated the peripheral refraction profiles in Indians. METHODS: A total of 161 participants aged between 18 and 33 years were included in the study. All of the eligible participants underwent a comprehensive eye examination. Central and peripheral refractions were determined using an open-field autorefractor in 10° intervals up to ±30° in the horizontal meridian, and in 5° intervals up to ±15° in the vertical meridian. Axial length and central corneal radius were measured using a non-contact optical biometer. Peripheral refraction was compared between the different refractive error groups and myopic subgroups. RESULTS: Myopes showed a significant asymmetrical peripheral refraction profile along horizontal meridian with relative peripheral myopia at nasal 30° and relative peripheral hyperopia at temporal 30° (mean ± standard error at N30°: -0.37 ± 0.13 D vs. T30°: +0.56 ± 0.11 D, P < .05). Emmetropes and hyperopes showed relative peripheral myopia both in nasal and temporal eccentricities. Relative peripheral refraction was significantly different between the refractive groups and myopic subgroups along the temporal retinal eccentricities only (P < .05). Along the vertical meridian, relative peripheral myopia was seen among the three refractive error groups (P < .05). J0 and J45 significantly changed with retinal eccentricity along both the meridians in all the refractive error groups (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Myopes showed an asymmetric type of peripheral refraction with relative hyperopic defocus in temporal retina and myopic defocus in the nasal retina. Possible role of retinal hyperopic defocus along temporal retina in myopiogenesis needs to be explored.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#9196,Comparison of Dynamic Retinoscopy and Autorefraction for Measurement of Accommodative Amplitude,"SIGNIFICANCE: This study promotes the use of dynamic retinoscopy to obtain objective measures of accommodative amplitude (AA) in the clinical setting in lieu of the subjective push-up technique. PURPOSE: This study compared the agreement between open-field autorefraction and a modified dynamic retinoscopy for the objective measurement of AA. METHODS: Accommodative amplitude was measured using two objective techniques for subjects aged 5 to 60 years. Test order was randomized and monocular AA was measured as subjects viewed printed letters 0.9 mm in height with their dominant eye and distance refraction. For retinoscopy, subjects held a near rod and viewed the target at the nearest (most proximal) point of clear vision. The examiner then performed dynamic retinoscopy along the horizontal meridian and identified the physical location of neutrality of the reflex, which was converted to AA in diopters. Autorefraction was performed obtaining repeated measures of refraction beginning from a target demand of 2.5 D and increasing in discrete steps until there was no subsequent increase in accommodative response. Refractions were converted to power in the horizontal meridian and expressed as accommodation in diopters with the maximal value termed the AA. Distance overrefractions were measured for both techniques to adjust AA for any uncorrected refractive error. Difference versus mean analysis was used to compare agreement between tests. RESULTS: The 95% limits of agreement between techniques were calculated after removal of two young outliers who responded poorly to one of the techniques. The overall mean difference for 95 subjects was 0.02 ± 0.97 D, with limits of agreement spanning -1.87 to 1.92 D. No significant linear relationship between the magnitude of the AA and the differences between techniques was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Agreement between dynamic retinoscopy and open-field autorefraction was less than 2 D with no systematic bias, suggesting that dynamic retinoscopy may be a suitable clinical technique to measure objective AA.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#9216,A randomized comparative trial of acupuncture versus transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation for chronic back pain in the elderly,"Sixty patients aged 60 or over with back pain for at least 6 months were recruited from General Practitioner referrals and randomized to 4 weeks of treatment with acupuncture or transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS). All treatments were administered by the same physiotherapist and both groups had the same contact with him. The following were measured at baseline, completion and at a 3-month follow-up by an independent observer blinded to treatment received: (1) pain severity on visual analogue scale (VAS); (2) pain subscale of Nottingham Health Profile (NHP); (3) number of analgesic tablets consumed in previous week; (4) spinal flexion from C7 to S1. Thirty-two patients were randomized to acupuncture and 28 to TENS; only three withdrew (two from acupuncture, one from TENS). Significant improvements were shown on VAS (P < 0.001), NHP (P < 0.001) and tablet count (P < 0.05) between baseline and completion in both groups, these improvements remaining significant comparing baseline with follow-up with a further non-significant improvement in VAS and NHP in the acupuncture group. The acupuncture but not the TENS patients showed a small but statistically significant improvement (P < 0.05) in mean spinal flexion between baseline and completion which was not maintained at follow-up. Thus in these elderly patients with chronic back pain both acupuncture and TENS had demonstrable benefits which outlasted the treatment period. Acupuncture may improve spinal flexion. This trial cannot exclude the possibility that both treatments are 'placebos'.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No
#9243,[Progress of researches on prevention and treatment of sports fatigue with moxibustion therapy],"Sports fatigue belongs to the category of functional deficiency-syndrome according to the theory of traditional Chinese medicine. The moxibustion therapy has a long history and possesses a definite therapeutic effect in the prevention and treatment of sports fatigue. In the present paper, the authors reviewed development of researches on the effects of moxibustion intervention in the prevention and treatment of sports fatigue in recent 5 years. Results of researches showed that moxibustion intervention can 1) eliminate free radicals and reduce oxidative damage; 2) increase energy (glycogen) supply to delay the production of fatigue; 3) raise serum testosterone level (relieve exercise-induced neuroendocrine disorder) and reduce post-sports fatigue; 4) raise the anaerobic exercise ability, reduce the accumulation of metabolic products in the body and strengthen the endurance capacity of the skeletal muscle; and 5) improve ischemic cardiac function, and suppress cardiomyocyte apopotosis, etc. However, we should further strengthen our investigations on the moxibustion therapy in the ancient classical literature and sum up academic thoughts of different academic schools in the successive dynasties, put emphasis on the large sample randomized controlled clinical trails, establish united treatment standards, etc., and provide much evidence for effectively treating sports fatigue in the future.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#9257,Earlier Acupuncture Enhancing Long-Term Effects on Motor Dysfunction in Acute Ischemic Stroke: Retrospective Cohort Study,"Stroke is the leading fatal disease in China. This retrospective study aimed to explore the optimal acupuncture intervention time for long-term efficacy on motor dysfunction in patients suffering from acute ischemic stroke through 1-year of follow-up. Three hundred and nine patients collected at Longhua Hospital from January 2016 to December 2017 were classified into 3 groups based on the acupuncture intervention time, including groups A (within 2 days), B (within 3-7 days) and C (within 8-14 days). All patients had received standard treatment combined with acupuncture therapy. Specifically, acupuncture was performed at the acupoints including LI4 (Hegu), ST40 (Fenglong), DU20 (Baihui), and motor area of the scalp, followed by 2 electroacupuncture protocols based on different muscle tensions once a day for 5 days consecutively. The time-effect relationship was assessed using both the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) and the modified Barthel index (MBI) on the 90th day and 1st year, respectively. Meanwhile, the modified Rankin scale (mRS), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and fibrinogen (FIB) were also measured during the 1-year follow-up. The favorable outcome rate was 74.4%. One-way univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed significant differences in FMA and MBI on the 90th day among the 3 groups ([Formula: see text] < 0.05), while no significant differences were observed in FMA, MBI or mRS at the 1st year between groups A and B. The levels of hs-CRP and FIB ([Formula: see text] < 0.05) were markedly reduced. Binary logistic regression analysis suggested that patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) (odds ratio (OR): 3.156), chronic kidney disease (CKD) (OR: 2.563), diabetes mellitus (DM) (OR: 2.174) or stroke history (OR: 1.883) were more inclined to recover poorly from nerve function deficit ([Formula: see text] < 0.05). Earlier acupuncture intervention may have a better long-term effect on motor dysfunction and inflammation during the 1-year follow-up. Moreover, acupuncture within 2 days is probably the optimal treatment time for early recovery on the 90th day.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#9271,Addition of choice of complementary therapies to usual care for acute low back pain: a randomized controlled trial,"STUDY DESIGN: A randomized controlled trial. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effectiveness and cost of usual care plus patient choice of acupuncture, chiropractic, or massage therapy (choice) compared with usual care alone in patients with acute low back pain (LBP). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Few studies have evaluated care models with facilitated access to and financial coverage for adjunctive complementary and alternative medicine therapies. METHODS: A total of 444 patients with acute LBP (<21 days) were recruited from 4 clinical sites and randomized into 2 groups: usual care or choice. Outcomes included symptoms (bothersomeness), functional status (Roland), and satisfaction between baseline and 5 weeks, and cost of medical care in the 12 weeks after randomization. RESULTS: After 5 weeks, providing patients with a choice did not yield clinically important reductions in symptoms (median -4, [interquartile range -7, -2] for usual care, and -5 [-7, -3] for choice; P = 0.002) or improvements in functional status (-8 [-13, -2] for usual care, and -9 [-15, -4] for choice; P = 0.15). Although there was a significantly greater satisfaction with care in the choice group, this came at a net increase in costs of 244 dollars per patient. This consisted of a 99 dollars reduction in the average cost to the insurer for medical care but an additional cost of 343 dollars, for an average of 6.0 complementary and alternative medicine treatments per patient. CONCLUSIONS: A model of care that offered access to a choice of complementary and alternative medicine therapies for acute LBP did not result in clinically significant improvements in symptom relief or functional restoration. This model was associated with greater patient satisfaction but increased total costs. Future evaluations of this choice model should focus on patients with chronic conditions (including chronic back pain) for which conventional medical care is often costly and of limited benefit.",No,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,No
#9273,Effectiveness of acupuncture for nonspecific chronic low back pain: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"STUDY DESIGN: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the totality of evidence in relation to the effectiveness of acupuncture for nonspecific chronic low back pain (NSCLBP). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Acupuncture has become a popular alternative for treating clinical symptoms of NSCLBP. A number of RCTs have examined the effectiveness of acupuncture in the treatment of NSCLBP. METHODS: A systematic literature search was completed without date or language restrictions up to May 2012. Studies included in the review were RCTs that examined all forms of acupuncture that adhered to the Traditional Acupuncture Theory for treating NSCLBP. Outcome measures included impairment, activity limitation, and participation restriction. The methodological quality of the studies was examined using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. RESULTS: Thirty-two studies were included in the systematic review, of which 25 studies presented relevant data for the meta-analysis. Acupuncture had a clinically meaningful reduction in levels of self-reported pain (mean difference =-16.76 [95% confidence interval, -33.33 to -0.19], P = 0.05, I = 90%) when compared with sham, and improved function (standard mean difference =-0.94 [95% confidence interval, -1.41 to -0.47], P < 0.00, I = 78%) when compared with no treatment immediately postintervention. Levels of function also clinically improved when acupuncture in addition to usual care, or electroacupuncture was compared with usual care alone. When acupuncture was compared with medications (NSAIDs, muscle relaxants, and analgesics) and usual care, there were statistically significant differences between the control and the intervention groups but these differences were too small to be of any clinical significance. There was no evidence in support of acupuncture over transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation. CONCLUSION: This systematic review demonstrates that acupuncture may have a favorable effect on self-reported pain and functional limitations on NSCLBP. However, the results should be interpreted in the context of the limitations identified, particularly in relation to the heterogeneity in the study characteristics and the low methodological quality in many of the included studies.

#9279,Update of Markov Model on the Cost-effectiveness of Nonpharmacologic Interventions for Chronic Low Back Pain Compared to Usual Care,"STUDY DESIGN: Markov model. OBJECTIVE: Further validity test of a previously published model. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The previous model was built using data from ten randomized trials and examined the 1-year effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of 17 nonpharmacologic interventions for chronic low back pain (CLBP), each compared to usual care alone. This update incorporated data from five additional trials. METHODS: Based on transition probabilities that were estimated using patient-level trial data, a hypothetical cohort of CLBP patients transitioned over time among four defined health states: high-impact chronic pain with substantial activity limitations; higher (moderate-impact) and lower (low-impact) pain without activity limitations; and no pain. As patients transitioned among health states, they accumulated quality-adjusted life-years, as well as healthcare and productivity costs. Costs and effects were calculated incremental to each study's version of usual care. RESULTS: From the societal perspective and assuming a typical patient mix (25% low-impact, 35% moderate-impact, and 40% high-impact chronic pain), most interventions-including those newly added-were cost-effective (<$50,000/QALY) and demonstrated cost savings. From the payer perspective, fewer were cost-saving, but the same number were cost-effective. Results for the new studies generally mirrored others using the same interventions-for example, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and physical therapy. A new acupuncture study had similar effectiveness to other acupuncture studies, but higher usual care costs, resulting in higher cost savings. Two new yoga studies' results were similar, but both differed from those of the original yoga study. Mindfulness-based stress reduction was similar to CBT for a typical patient mix but was twice as effective for those with high-impact chronic pain. CONCLUSION: Markov modeling facilitates comparisons across interventions not directly compared in trials, using consistent outcome measures after balancing the baseline mix of patients. Outcomes also differed by pain impact level, emphasizing the need to measure CLBP subgroups. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: N/A.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#9287,Can Acupuncture Improve Chronic Spinal Pain? A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect and safety of acupuncture for the treatment of chronic spinal pain. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Web of Science, the WHO Clinical Trial Registry, and the US National Library of Medicine clinical trial registry were searched from January 1, 2000, to November 1, 2019. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving patients with chronic spinal pain treated by acupuncture versus sham acupuncture, no treatment, or another treatment were included. RESULTS: Data was extracted from 22 RCTs including 2588 patients. Pooled analysis revealed that acupuncture can reduce chronic spinal pain compared to sham acupuncture (weighted mean difference [WMD] -12.05, 95% confidence interval [CI] -15.86 to -8.24), mediation control (WMD -18.27, 95% CI -28.18 to -8.37), usual care control (WMD -9.57, 95% CI -13.48 to -9.44), and no treatment control (WMD -17.10, 95% CI -24.83 to -9.37). In terms of functional disability, acupuncture can improve physical function at immediate-term follow-up (standardized mean difference [SMD] -1.74, 95% CI -2.04 to -1.44), short-term follow-up (SMD -0.89, 95% CI -1.15 to -0.62), and long-term follow-up (SMD -1.25, 95% CI -1.48 to -1.03). CONCLUSION: In summary, compared to no treatment, sham acupuncture, or conventional therapy such as medication, massage, and physical exercise, acupuncture has a significantly superior effect on the reduction in chronic spinal pain and function improvement. Acupuncture might be an effective treatment for patients with chronic spinal pain and it is a safe therapy.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#9292,Massage for low back pain: an updated systematic review within the framework of the Cochrane Back Review Group,"STUDY DESIGN: Systematic Review. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of massage therapy for nonspecific low back pain. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Low back pain is one of the most common and costly musculoskeletal problems in modern society. Proponents of massage therapy claim it can minimize pain and disability, and speed return to normal function. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL from their beginning to May 2008. We also searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2006, issue 3), HealthSTAR and Dissertation abstracts up to 2006. There were no language restrictions. References in the included studies and in reviews of the literature were screened. The studies had to be randomized or quasi-randomized trials investigating the use of any type of massage (using the hands or a mechanical device) as a treatment for nonspecific low back pain. Two review authors selected the studies, assessed the risk of bias using the criteria recommended by the Cochrane Back Review Group, and extracted the data using standardized forms. Both qualitative and meta-analyses were performed. RESULTS: Thirteen randomized trials were included. Eight had a high risk and 5 had a low risk of bias. One study was published in German and the rest in English. Massage was compared to an inert therapy (sham treatment) in 2 studies that showed that massage was superior for pain and function on both short- and long-term follow-ups. In 8 studies, massage was compared to other active treatments. They showed that massage was similar to exercises, and massage was superior to joint mobilization, relaxation therapy, physical therapy, acupuncture, and self-care education. One study showed that reflexology on the feet had no effect on pain and functioning. The beneficial effects of massage in patients with chronic low back pain lasted at least 1 year after the end of the treatment. Two studies compared 2 different techniques of massage. One concluded that acupuncture massage produces better results than classic (Swedish) massage and another concluded that Thai massage produces similar results to classic (Swedish) massage. CONCLUSION: Massage might be beneficial for patients with subacute and chronic nonspecific low back pain, especially when combined with exercises and education. The evidence suggests that acupuncture massage is more effective than classic massage, but this need confirmation. More studies are needed to confirm these conclusions, to assess the impact of massage on return-to-work, and to determine cost-effectiveness of massage as an intervention for low back pain.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#9311,"Discussing the possibility of fertility treatment being unsuccessful as part of routine care offered at clinics: patients' experiences, willingness, and preferences","STUDY QUESTION: Are patients willing to discuss the possibility of treatment being unsuccessful as part of routine care offered at clinics, and what are the factors associated with this willingness? SUMMARY ANSWER: Nine in every 10 patients are willing to discuss this possibility as part of routine care, with willingness being associated with higher perceived benefits, lower barriers, and stronger positive attitudes towards it. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Fifty-eight percent of patients who complete up to three cycles of IVF/ICSI in the UK do not achieve a live birth. Offering psychosocial care for unsuccessful fertility treatment (PCUFT), defined as assistance and guidance on the implications of treatment being unsuccessful, could reduce the psychosocial distress patients experience when it happens, and promote positive adjustment to this loss. Research shows 56% of patients are willing to plan for an unsuccessful cycle, but little is known about their willingness and preferences towards discussing the possibility of definitive unsuccessful treatment. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: The study was of cross-sectional design, comprising a theoretically driven and patient-centred bilingual (English, Portuguese) mixed-methods online survey. The survey was disseminated via social media (April 2021-January 2022). Eligibility criteria included being aged 18 or older, waiting to or undergoing an IVF/ICSI cycle, or having completed a cycle within the previous 6 months without achieving a pregnancy. Out of 651 people accessing the survey, 451 (69.3%) consented to participate. From these, 100 did not complete 50% of the survey questions, nine did not report on the primary outcome variable (willingness), and 342 completed the survey (completion rate 75.8%, 338 women). PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: The survey was informed by the Health Belief Model (HBM) and Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB). Quantitative questions covered sociodemographic characteristics and treatment history. Quantitative and qualitative questions gathered data on past experiences, willingness, and preferences (with whom, what, how and when) to receive PCUFT, as well as theory-informed factors hypothesized to be associated with patients' willingness to receive it. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used on quantitative data about PCUFT experiences, willingness, and preferences, and thematic analysis was applied to textual data. Two logistic regressions were used to investigate the factors associated with patients' willingness. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Participants were, on average, 36 years old and most resided in Portugal (59.9%) and the UK (38.0%). The majority (97.1%) were in a relationship for around 10 years, and 86.3% were childless. Participants were undergoing treatment for, on average, 2 years [SD = 2.11, range: 0-12 years], with most (71.8%) having completed at least one IVF/ICSI cycle in the past, almost all (93.5%) without success. Around one-third (34.9%) reported having received PCUFT. Thematic analysis showed participants received it mainly from their consultant. The main topic discussed was patients' low prognosis, with the emphasis being put on achieving a positive outcome. Almost all participants (93.3%) would like to receive PCUFT. Reported preferences indicated that 78.6% wanted to receive it from a psychologist/psychiatrist/counsellor, mostly in case of a bad prognosis (79.4%), emotional distress (73.5%), or difficulties in accepting the possibility of treatment being unsuccessful (71.2%). The preferred time to receive PCUFT was before initiating the first cycle (73.3%), while the preferred format was in an individual (mean = 6.37, SD = 1.17; in 1-7 scale) or couple (mean = 6.34, SD = 1.24; in 1-7 scale) session. Thematic analysis showed participants would like PCUFT to provide an overview of treatment and all possible outcomes tailored to each patient's circumstances and to encompass psychosocial support, mainly focused on coping strategies to process loss and sustain hope towards the future. Willingness to receive PCUFT was associated with higher perceived benefit of building psychosocial resources and coping strategies (odds ratios (ORs) 3.40, 95% CI 1.23-9.38), lower perceived barrier of triggering negative emotions (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.24-0.98), and stronger positive attitudes about PCUFT being beneficial and useful (OR 3.32, 95% CI 2.12-5.20). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Self-selected sample, mainly composed of female patients who had not yet achieved their parenthood goals. The small number of participants unwilling to receive PCUFT reduced statistical power. The primary outcome variable was intentions, and research shows a moderate association between intentions and actual behaviour. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Fertility clinics should provide patients with early opportunities to discuss the possibility of their treatment being unsuccessful as part of routine care. PCUFT should focus on minimizing suffering associated with grief and loss by reassuring patients they can cope with any treatment outcome, promoting coping resources, and signposting to additional support.

Compared with usual care, there was a statistically significant reduction in mean M-JOA score at 2 weeks and 6 months for HSM (3.8 ± 2.6 versus 8.5 ± 2.9; 3.7 ± 2.2 versus 10.1 ± 2.9) and conventional moxibustion (7.9 ± 3.0 versus 8.5 ± 2.9; 8.9 ± 3.1 versus 10.1 ± 2.9). Compared with conventional moxibustion group, HSM group showed greater improvement in all the outcomes. The mean dose of moxibustion was 41.13 ± 5.26 (range 21-60) minutes in the HSM group. We found that HSM was more effective in treating patients with LDH, compared with conventional moxibustion and conventional drug plus acupuncture.

#9347,[Retrospective analysis on acupuncture in treatment of cerebral infarction evaluated with propensity score],"The actual efficacy of acupuncture on cerebral infarction was explored in clinical practice. The retro spective cohort study was adopted to investigate 344 cases via inpatient's medical cases. According to whether acupuncture was received or not, an acupuncture group (207 cases) and a non-acupuncture group (137 cases) were divided. The matching method, regression method and weighting method of propensity score (PS) were adopted, and the efficacy on muscle strength was taken as effect index so that the specific impacts of acupuncture were ex plored on the muscle strength in the patients of cerebral infarction. Before matching, COX regression model and Logistic regression model were used. And PS hierarchical regression, PS inverse probability weighting method (IPTW) and PS standardized mortality weighting method (SMRW) were applied to the analysis on the relationship between the muscle strengthen changes and the total effective rate in the two groups. It was found that the efficacy in the acupuncture group was better than that in the non-acupuncture group, indicating the significant difference (P<0.05). Meanwhile, the rehabilitation therapy also brought the obvious impacts on the efficacy evaluation (OR=2.737, P=0.0055). After PS matching, the Logistic regression model was used to analyze whether acupuncture or rehabilitation therapy impacted the total effective rate of muscle strength. The results showed that the efficacy was impacted apparently with the rehabilitation therapy involved (OR=2.930, P=0.0247). Without the rehabilitation effect considered, the efficacy in the acupuncture group was better potentially than that in the non-acupuncture group, but without significant difference (OR=2. 235, P=0,058 7).

#9361,Comparison of Effects of Local Anesthesia and Two-Point Acupressure on the Severity of Venipuncture Pain Among Hospitalized 6-12-Year-Old Children,"The aim of the present study was to compare the effects of topical anesthesia and acupressure at the Yintang (Extra 1) and the Laogong (P-8) points on the severity of venipuncture pain among hospitalized 6-12-year-old children. A sample (n = 120) of 6-12-year-old hospitalized children was recruited from two teaching hospitals located in Rafsanjan, Iran. The children were allocated to the topical anesthesia, acupressure, and control groups. For children in the topical anesthesia and the acupressure groups, eutectic mixture of local anesthetic (EMLA) cream and two-point acupressure were used, respectively, prior to performing venipuncture, whereas children in the control group only received routine prevenipuncture care. The severity of venipuncture pain was evaluated 5 minutes after performing venipuncture by using the Face, Leg, Activity, Cry, and Consolability behavioral pain assessment scale. The findings revealed that pain severity in both experimental groups was significantly lower than that in the control group, whereas there was no significant difference between the experimental groups regarding pain severity. Although acupressure was as effective as topical anesthesia cream in alleviating children's venipuncture pain, nurses are recommending to use acupressure instead of pharmacological pain management agents because of its greater safety, cost-effectiveness, and applicability.",No,No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No
#9380,Assessment and statistics of surgically induced astigmatism,"The aim of the thesis was to develop methods for assessment of surgically induced astigmatism (SIA) in individual eyes, and in groups of eyes. The thesis is based on 12 peer-reviewed publications, published over a period of 16 years. In these publications older and contemporary literature was reviewed(1). A new method (the polar system) for analysis of SIA was developed. Multivariate statistical analysis of refractive data was described(2-4). Clinical validation studies were performed. The description of a cylinder surface with polar values and differential geometry was compared. The main results were: refractive data in the form of sphere, cylinder and axis may define an individual patient or data set, but are unsuited for mathematical and statistical analyses(1). The polar value system converts net astigmatisms to orthonormal components in dioptric space. A polar value is the difference in meridional power between two orthogonal meridians(5,6). Any pair of polar values, separated by an arch of 45 degrees, characterizes a net astigmatism completely(7). The two polar values represent the net curvital and net torsional power over the chosen meridian(8). The spherical component is described by the spherical equivalent power. Several clinical studies demonstrated the efficiency of multivariate statistical analysis of refractive data(4,9-11). Polar values and formal differential geometry describe astigmatic surfaces with similar concepts and mathematical functions(8). Other contemporary methods, such as Long's power matrix, Holladay's and Alpins' methods, Zernike(12) and Fourier analyses(8), are correlated to the polar value system. In conclusion, analysis of SIA should be performed with polar values or other contemporary component systems. The study was supported by Statens Sundhedsvidenskabeligt Forskningsråd, Cykelhandler P.

#9477,Effects of acupuncture at Neiguan (PC 6) of the pericardial meridian on blood pressure and heart rate variability,"The aims of this study were to investigate (i) if and when the blood pressure would rise or fall and (ii) the associated changes of human heart rate variability (HRV) by manual stimulation of the Neiguan (PC 6) acupuncture site. In this paper, two groups of six healthy male volunteers with ranges of ages 20-56 and 20-55 and with no neurological diseases participated in this study. In order to minimize artefacts, the electrocardiogram (ECG) and radial arterial pulse pressure wave were collected with the subjects alert but eyes closed before, during, and after sham/manual acupuncture. No statistically significant changes (P > 0.05) were found in the sham acupuncture group. As for the manual acupuncture group, the needle was inserted into the PC 6 acupoint and manually stimulated about 15 to 30 seconds to achieve De Qi sensation. Needles were left in place for 30 min and then removed. Analysis of the data due to acupuncture was then compared with the baseline values. Results indicate that the blood pressures of different subject can either rise (P < 0.01) or fall (P < 0.01). To further determine the indicator for one subject who exhibited both rise and fall of blood pressures, 7 more trials were given conducted with the same protocol until statistically significant results were obtained (P < 0.01). We found that his change of blood pressure was highly correlated (p = -0.94 and -0.99 for rise and fall, respectively) with the ratio of the magnitude of pulse pressure to that of the dicrotic notch in the local radial pulse wave (P < 0.01). As to the heart rate variability (HRV) spectra, significant changes in the low frequency (LF) and very low frequency (VLF) ranges were also detected. These results indicate that the autonomic innervations of heart have been modified. However, the information on the power of LF, high frequency (HF), and LF/HF of HRV are not conclusive to statistically differentiate the sympathetic contribution from that of the parasympathetic nervous systems at present stage.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes

#9494,[Application of placebo acupuncture in randomized controlled trials in the past 10 years in foreign countries],"The application of placebo acupuncture in randomized controlled trials in the past 10 years (2004-2014) in foreign countries was systematically reviewed to summarize the design of placebo acupuncture; according to category of diseases, advantages and disadvantages were analyzed to explore an ideal placebo acupuncture set. By retrieval in PubMed, EMBASE and OVID databases, the clinical study literature which met the inclusion criteria was searched, and the category of diseases, design of placebo acupuncture and clinical efficacy were analyzed. Totally 29 articles were included. The pain was the leading disease in category of diseases; the most commonly used application of placebo acupuncture design was telescopiform sliding blunt needle, accounting for 45. 16%; the treatment locations were non-acupoints mostly; in the needling depth, approximately 60. 00% selected non-penetrating needling and 26. 67% selected superficial needling; 28 articles indicated that acupuncture and placebo acupuncture had clinical effects, accounting for 96. 55%; 37. 93% of articles indicated acupuncture was superior to placebo acupuncture and 37. 93% of articles indicated acupuncture was not superior to placebo acupuncture. It is concluded that the design of placebo acupuncture should consider multiple factors, including main symptoms, operability, security, blinding and specific effects, and the objective indices should be selected for outcome evaluation.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#9501,[Acupuncture worth trying in severe tinnitus],"The article consists in a report of a study of 22 patients with disabling tinnitus, performed to elucidate the effects of a 3-month course of acupuncture (15 treatments) on the severity of tinnitus and on quality of life (QOL), as compared with those of individualised physiotherapy. The study was designed as a prospective, randomised, cross-over study with a follow-up period of one year after the final treatment. Treatment effects were evaluated in terms of the patients' VAS (visual analogue scale) ratings and answers to questionnaires, including the NHP (Nottingham Health Profile), regarding the impact of tinnitus on different aspects of QOL. Baseline NHP scores showed tinnitus patients to manifest pronounced depressive characteristics. Acupuncture was found to yield immediate relief, both in terms of loudness and disturbance of the tinnitus, and significant improvement in QOL (NHP) for three months after the conclusion of treatment. Although many patients in the subgroup with concurrent muscle tension reported beneficial effects of individualised physiotherapy, such treatment yielded no significant reduction of tinnitus loudness or disturbance due to tinnitus, and no improvement in NHP scores. In both treatment groups, however, both annoyance due to tinnitus and QOL scores had returned to pretreatment levels at one-year follow-up. Thus, the results suggest tinnitus patients to manifest depressive characteristics, and that acupuncture may yield temporary improvement in terms of tinnitus relief and QOL.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No

#9527,"Do whispering minds tingle alike? Exploring the relationship between ASMR-sensitivity, trait-ASMR, and trigger preference","The Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response (ASMR) is described as a pleasant tingling sensation originating in the head and neck in response to specific audio-visual stimuli (triggers) with individuals self-classifying as ASMR-responders based on their experience of the phenomenon. There is great variability in the types of triggers that elicit ASMR across individuals, with previous attempts to categorise triggers encompassing multiple affective components across sensory domains. More recently, research indicates ASMR should be considered a personality construct, with traits falling on a spectrum regardless of ASMR-sensitivity. The current study recruited an extensive sample of ASMR viewers (n = 16,679) to investigate characteristics of trait-ASMR using psychometric properties of the ASMR-15 in self-classified ASMR-responders who either experienced 'authentic' ASMR where tingles originated in the head and neck or 'non-authentic' ASMR, where tingles originate in other bodily regions. Secondly, we explored group differences in trigger intensity by trait-ASMR and ASMR-sensitivity. K-means cluster analysis identified tripartite trait-ASMR categorisation (High/ Medium/ Low). These cluster analysis groups showed distinct profiles across the ASMR-15 subscales evidenced with medium effect sizes, whereas the difference based on authentic vs. non-authentic ASMR experience was a small effect. To identify trigger categorisation, principal component analyses revealed four key categories: Roleplay, Watching, Interpersonal care, and Tactile. Group differences by trait-ASMR grouping across the trigger categorisation revealed small to medium effects, whereas effect sizes by ASMR-sensitivity were predominantly small to negligible. This suggests we should conceptualize individual differences in ASMR experience as a trait on a spectrum rather than a dichotomous categorical variable since only trait classification accounted for individual differences in ASMR-propensity and trigger categorisation.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#9555,[Application exploration of comparative effectiveness research in clinical efficacy optimization of abdominal acupuncture],"The concepts and characteristics of comparative effectiveness research (CER) are analyzed to explore its scientific research methodology in clinical efficacy optimization of abdominal acupuncture. The designs of CER focus on patients, which emphasize assessment of comprehensive efficacy in real medical environment instead of simple efficacy in randomized controlled trial (RCT). Its research strategy involves four categories and three subject, covering acquiring, saving and management, comparison and application of clinical evidence, which has practical application value in comprehensive comparison of advantages and efficacy rules of different acupuncture therapies and acupoint prescriptions. By establishing clinical registration system, oversized-sample data could be acquired from different centers to effectively overcome insufficient sample-induced sampling error. It has important value in system summary and optimization of clinical efficacy of abdominal acupuncture. The CER fully illustrates clinical reality of acupuncture-moxibustion and provides strong support of scientific data for optimization of curative effect. It embodies prescription standardization, manipulation normalization and methodization of syndrome differentiation in clinic of abdominal acupuncture, which is expected to achieve evidence-based optimization of treatment prescription and technique in abdominal acupuncture.",Yes,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No

#9574,Visually triggered eye-arm movements in man,"The degree of temporal coupling and the nature of temporal ordering between the gaze (eye-head) and arm motor systems was studied in normal subjects by measuring the reaction time, RT, of each system to randomly generated visual signals presented along the horizontal meridian: (1) at two spatial locations, 15.5 degrees and 29.1 degrees, (2) to the right and left of a central fixation point, and (3) with and without room illumination. Upon detecting the visual signal, the subject was instructed to guide the arm from its rest position upon a supporting table and to extinguish the light source by touching a metal disc enclosing the stimulus ""as quickly and accurately as possible."" The results indicated (1) saccadic eye motion initiated gaze towards the target, (2) a change in the eccentric position of the target was associated with alteration of the eye and arm RT by a similar value; the interval between eye and the subsequent arm RT was invariant with spatial location no matter the presence or absence of room illumination, and (3) the arm RT increased when visual information of the environment was not available. It is postulated that a visual stimulus triggers a command system releasing a patterned sequence of eye-hand-arm motion; the initiation of motion in these motor systems is based upon the same retinal error calculation; however, no rigid rule can be established for the serial ordering or temporal sequencing of motion between the triggered motor systems. The temporal arrangement between head and arm with eye can be modified, at least in part, by alterations in supraspinal control of postural mechanisms and/or motoneuronal excitability of the responding muscles prior to motion.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#9581,Brain imaging of acupuncture: comparing superficial with deep needling,"The difference between superficial and deep needling at acupuncture points has yet to be mapped with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Using a 3T MRI, echo planar imaging data were acquired for 17 right-handed healthy volunteer participants. Two fMRI scans of acupuncture needling were taken in random order in a block design, one for superficial and one for deep needling on the right hand at the acupuncture point LI-4 (Hegu), with the participant blind to the order. For both scans needle stimulation was used. Brain image analysis tools were used to explore within-group and between-group differences in the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) responses. The study demonstrated marked similarities in BOLD signal responses between superficial and deep needling, with no significant differences in either activations (increases in BOLD signal) or deactivations (decreases in BOLD signal) above the voxel Z score of 2.3 with corrected cluster significance of P=0.05. For both types of needling, deactivations predominated over activations. These fMRI data suggest that acupuncture needle stimulation at two different depths of needling, superficial and deep, do not elicit significantly different BOLD responses. This data is consistent with the equivalent therapeutic outcomes that are claimed by proponents of Japanese and Chinese styles of acupuncture that utilise superficial and deep needling, respectively.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#9593,[Condition and effectiveness evaluation of acupuncture for smoking cessation],"The efectienes of acpuncture for smoking cessation was systematically evaluated in this paper. By using computer retrieval in Chinese national knowledge infrastructure (CNKI), WANFANG database, VIP database, PubMed, ScienceDirect and Springer, the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) regarding acupuncture for smoking cessation from January of 1983 to December of 2013 were collected; by using Table of Standardized Report Factors for Acupuncture RCTs, each inclusive RCT was evaluated; and by using RevMan 5. 2 software, the Meta-analysis was performed. Totally 24 RCTs were included, involving 3084 cases of smoking. The result of literature quality assessment showed that the average score was 25. 71 points without low-quality RCT which had a score of less than 16 points. The Meta-analysis showed that acupuncture could significantly increase the short-time abstinence rate [RR=1. 48, 95% CI (1. 18,1. 84), Z=3. 47, P<0. 0005] and number of cigarettes smoked daily [RR=4. 35, 95% CI (2. 03, 6. 66), Z=3. 68, P<0. 001] and FTND [RR=2. 37, 95% CI (1. 88, 2. 86), Z= 9. 44, P<0. 00001], however, it could not increase the long-time abstinence rate [RR=1. 40, 95% Cl (0. 90, 2.17), Z=1. 49, P>0. 05]. Compared with other treatment, acupuncture has positive advantages on short-time abstinence rate, however, its effect on long-time abstinence rate needs to be verified by high-quality, large-sample and multi-center RCT in the future.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No

Test teeth were cleaned with pumice and 10% alcohol, air-dried, and insulated at the approximal surfaces with strips of rubber dam. Based on a comparison of bipolar and monopolar stimulation the latter method was chosen, with the cathode placed on the incisal third of the facial surface, the indifferent electrode in the subject's hand. In separate groups of subjects thresholds were assessed four times at intervals of 15 min without acupuncture (1), with acupuncture performed manually (2) and electrically (3), and during electrical stimulation with surface electrodes over acupuncture points (4). On separate days acupuncture and surface stimulation was applied unilaterally at the points S2 (cheek), Li4 (hand), or S44 (foot). Compared with control threshold (8.44 muA) acupuncture was accompanied by a small increase, most pronounced after 45 min (1.51 muA, P less than 0.0005).

#9630,Acupuncture increases bone strength by improving mass and structure in established osteoporosis after ovariectomy in rats,"The effects of acupuncture on bone biomechanical properties and histomorphometry in ovariectomized (OVX) rats were studied. Twenty-four 8-week-old female Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to three groups: sham, model and acupuncture. Rats in the model and acupuncture groups were ovariectomized, while those in the sham group underwent a sham operation. All rats were anesthetized and fastened for 15 minutes, and for the acupuncture group, needling on Pishu (BL20) and Shenshu (BL23) was performed. Blood and urine were collected to measure serum osteocalcin (OC) and urinary calcium, phosphorus or deoxypyridinoline (Dpd). After 16 weeks of treatment, all the rats were killed and their tibiae and femora were removed. The tibiae were used for analyses of bone histomorphometry and the femora for a three-point bending test. Acupuncture gave significant protection against ovariectomy-caused decline on femoral strength in the mechanical test, increased the trabecular bone volume and thickness, lowered the trabecular separation of tibiae and restricted the excretion of phosphorus and Dpd, while promoting the concentrations of serum osteocalcin as compared with model rats. These results seemed to indicate that acupuncture on the points of Pishu (BL20) and Shenshu (BL23) not only promoted the bone formation but also suppressed the bone resorption induced by OVX in osteoporotic rats, which suggests that it would be a potentially useful and convenient method in preventing osteoporosis.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#9646,Electroacupuncture-induced attenuation of experimental epilepsy: a comparative evaluation of acupoints and stimulation parameters,"The efficacy of electroacupuncture (EA) on epilepsy remains to be verified because of previous controversies that might be due to the complexity of the effects induced by different acupoints and stimulation approaches adopted. Therefore, we investigated the effects of EA on epilepsy to determine the specific acupoints and optimal stimulation parameters in this work. Experimental epilepsy was induced by injecting kainic acid to the lateral cerebral ventricle of adult male SD rats. EA with a low-frequency (10 Hz/1 mA) or high-frequency (100 Hz/1 mA) current was applied to the epileptic model for 30 minutes starting at 0.5 hour after the injection. Four pairs of acupoints were tested, that is, Shuigou (DU26) + Dazhui (DU14), Jinsuo (DU8) + Yaoqi (EXB9), Neiguan (PC6) + Quchi (LI11), and Fenglong (ST40) + Yongquan (KI1). We found that (1) low- or high-frequency EA at different acupoints reduced epileptic seizures (P < 0.05 versus the control) with an exception of low-frequency EA at Neiguan (PC6) and Quchi (LI11); (2) low-frequency EA induced a better effect at Fenglong (ST40) plus Yongquan (KI1) than that of the other acupoints (P < 0.05); (3) there is no significant difference in the effects of high-frequency EA at these acupoints; and (4) the high-frequency EA elicited a greater effect than that of low-frequency EA in all groups (P < 0.05), with an exception at Jinsuo (DU8) + Yaoqi (EXB9). The EA-induced attenuation appeared 1-1.5 hours after EA with no appreciable effect in the first hour after EA in either the EEG or the behavioral tests. We conclude that EA attenuation of epileptic seizures is dependent on the stimulation parameters and acupoints and that the delay in appearance of the EA effect could be a reflection of the time required by the EA signal to regulate neural function in the central nervous system.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#9677,Trial history biases the spatial programming of antisaccades,"The historical context in which saccades are made influences their latency and error rates, but less is known about how context influences their spatial parameters. We recently described a novel spatial bias for antisaccades, in which the endpoints of these responses deviate towards alternative goal locations used in the same experimental block, and showed that expectancy (prior probability) is at least partly responsible for this 'alternate-goal bias'. In this report we asked whether trial history also plays a role. Subjects performed antisaccades to a stimulus randomly located on the horizontal meridian, on a 40° angle downwards from the horizontal meridian, or on a 40° upward angle, with all three locations equally probable on any given trial. We found that the endpoints of antisaccades were significantly displaced towards the goal location of not only the immediately preceding trial (n - 1) but also the penultimate (n - 2) trial. Furthermore, this bias was mainly present for antisaccades with a short latency of <250 ms and was rapidly corrected by secondary saccades. We conclude that the location of recent antisaccades biases the spatial programming of upcoming antisaccades, that this historical effect persists over many seconds, and that it influences mainly rapidly generated eye movements. Because corrective saccades eliminate the historical bias, we suggest that the bias arises in processes generating the response vector, rather than processes generating the perceptual estimate of goal location.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No

While extensive clinical experience suggests that acupuncture detoxification is both safe and acceptable to those in withdrawal, little research has been conducted to assess its efficacy as a treatment modality. In this first controlled study of acupuncture heroin detoxification, 100 addicted persons were randomly assigned, in a single-blind design, to the standard auricular acupuncture treatment used for addiction or to a ""sham"" treatment that used points that were geographically close to the standard points. Attrition was high for both groups, but subjects assigned to the standard treatment attended the acupuncture clinic more days and stayed in treatment longer than those assigned to the sham condition. Additionally, attendance varied inversely with self-reports of frequency of drug use, suggesting that those with lighter habits found the treatment modality more helpful.

#9738,"The National Acupuncture Detoxification Association protocol, auricular acupuncture to support patients with substance abuse and behavioral health disorders: current perspectives","The National Acupuncture Detoxification Association (NADA)-standardized 3- to 5-point ear acupuncture protocol, born of a community-minded response to turbulent times not unlike today, has evolved into the most widely implemented acupuncture-assisted protocol, not only for substance abuse, but also for broad behavioral health applications. This evolution happened despite inconsistent research support. This review highlights the history of the protocol and the research that followed its development. Promising, early randomized-controlled trials were followed by a mixed field of positive and negative studies that may serve as a whole to prove that NADA, despite its apparent simplicity, is neither a reductive nor an independent treatment, and the need to refine the research approaches. Particularly focusing on the last decade and its array of trials that elucidate aspects of NADA application and effects, the authors recommend that, going forward, research continues to explore the comparison of the NADA protocol added to accepted treatments to those treatments alone, recognizing that it is not a stand-alone procedure but a psychosocial intervention that affects the whole person and can augment outcomes from other treatment modalities.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#9750,Effect of magnitopuncture on sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve activities in healthy drivers--assessment by power spectrum analysis of heart rate variability,"The object of this study was to assess the effects of magnitopuncture applied to Dazhui (DU14) point and Neiguan (PC6) points on sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve activities by power spectrum analysis of heart rate variability in healthy drivers during simulated driving. Using power spectrum analysis, the low frequency (LF) and high frequency (HF) components of heart rate variability can be calculated reflecting the sympathetic and parasympathetic activity. The 40 healthy male subjects were randomly divided into two groups: A (study group) and B (control group). All subjects were required to be well rested before the experiment. The subjects of both groups were required to perform a simulated driving task for 3 h. During the driving, magnitopunctures were applied to the DU14 and PC6 points for A while the subject performed the task for 2.5 h, and for B magnitopunctures were applied to non-acupuncture points which were 1.5 cm away from the two acupuncture points respectively over the same time. Subjective response to a questionnaire was obtained after the simulated task in the two groups. At the end of the driving task the LF component in normalized units (NU) had decreased significantly ( P<0.05) indicating a reduced sympathetic nerve activity and the HF component (NU) increased significantly ( P<0.05) indicating a increased parasympathetic nerve activity for A compared with pre-stimulation while for B no significant differences were observed. There were significant group differences in LF (NU), HF (NU) and LF:HF at the end of the driving task ( P<0.05). It was concluded that a modulating effect of magnitopuncture on sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve activities in healthy subjects was associated with the acupuncture points. The findings represent physiological evidence that magnitopuncture may reduce mental fatigue in healthy drivers.",No,No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No

Twenty-four patients with SLE were randomly assigned to receive 10 sessions of either acupuncture, minimal needling or usual care. Pain, fatigue and SLE disease activity were assessed at baseline and following the last sessions. Safety was assessed at each session. Fifty-two patients were screened to enroll 24 eligible and interested persons. Although transient side effects, such as brief needling pain and lightheadedness, were reported, no serious adverse events were associated with either the acupuncture or minimal needling procedures. Twenty-two participants completed the study, and the majority (85%) of acupuncture and minimal needling participants were able to complete their sessions within the specified time period of 5-6 weeks. 40% of patients who received acupuncture or minimal needling had >/=30% improvement on standard measures of pain, but no usual care patients showed improvement in pain.

Piribedil, pramipexole, pramipexole extended release, ropinirole, rotigotine, cabergoline, and pergolide were all efficacious as symptomatic monotherapy; ropinirole prolonged release was likely efficacious. All were efficacious as a symptomatic adjunct except pramipexole extended release, for which there is insufficient evidence. For prevention/delay of motor fluctuations, pramipexole and cabergoline were efficacious, and for prevention/delay of dyskinesia, pramipexole, ropinirole, ropinirole prolonged release, and cabergoline were all efficacious, whereas pergolide was likely efficacious. Duodenal infusion of levodopa was likely efficacious in the treatment of motor complications, but the practice implication is investigational. Entacapone was nonefficacious as a symptomatic adjunct to levodopa in nonfluctuating patients and nonefficacious in the prevention/delay of motor complications. Rasagiline conclusions were revised to efficacious as a symptomatic adjunct, and as treatment for motor fluctuations. Clozapine was efficacious in dyskinesia, but because of safety issues, the practice implication is possibly useful. Bilateral subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation, bilateral globus pallidus stimulation, and unilateral pallidotomy were updated to efficacious for motor complications. Physical therapy was revised to likely efficacious as symptomatic adjunct therapy. This evidence-based medicine review updates the field and highlights gaps for research.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#9822,Effects of electroacupuncture on acute cerebral infarction,"The present paper is to study the effects of electroacupuncture (EA) on acute ischemic stroke patient and acute cerebral ischemic rat. In clinic, 42 acute ischemic stroke patients were randomly divided into 2 therapeutic groups: drug group and EA+ drug group. Neurological deficits of patients were evaluated before and after the treatment by Chinese Stroke Scale. The results showed that the acute ischemic stroke patients treated by drug or EA+ drug were all partially recovered, but the clinical functional recovery in EA+ drug group was significantly better than in the drug group (P < 0.01). In laboratory, the model of reversible middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was used in rats. The somatosensory evoked potential (SEP) was recorded before and after MCAO. EA was applied one hour after cerebral ischemia and once a day after reperfusion for 7 days in EA+ MCAO group. It was shown that the amplitude of P1-N1 wave of SEP before MCAO was 100%. After MCAO 30 min the P1-N1 wave of SEP on the ipsilateral side of MCAO was decreased to 2.2 +/- 3% (MCAO group), 1.9 +/- 2% (MCAO+ EA group); and then recovered to 25.5 +/- 14.1% (MCAO group), 58.6 +/- 27.2% (MCAO+ EA group) after 7 days of reperfusion following MCAO 2 hours. The above results indicated that EA could promote the recovery of neurological function in acute ischemic stroke patients and SEP on MCAO rats.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes
#9859,Comparison between superficial and deep acupuncture in the treatment of the shoulder's myofascial pain: a randomized and controlled study,"The principle aim of the present work is the evaluation of the importance of the variable ""depth"" of needle insertion in the determination of acupuncture's therapeutic results. A randomized clinical trial carried out on 44 patients belonging to two groups of 22 each, suffering from shoulder myofascial pain: group A: superficial acupuncture; group B: deep acupuncture. All of them subjected to the same model of treatment with 13 needles and the treatment of the most painful 4 trigger points (TP) found in the shoulder's area. In the group A patients, the needles were introduced in the skin at a depth of 2 mm, on the TP. In the group B patients, the needles were placed deeply both in the muscular acupuncture points and in the TP. The treatment was planned for a cycle of 8 sessions, the first 4 to be performed twice a week, the last 4 weekly. The intensity of pain was evaluated with the McGill Pain Questionnaire before beginning the therapy, at the end of the therapy, and at the follow-up after 1 and 3 months. Both techniques had efficacy in controlling pain. A statistically significant difference rose between the two needling techniques at the end of the treatment and at the follow up after one and three months. Deep acupuncture shows to be better at all times and this underlines the importance of the muscular afferences in acupunctural stimulation in the control of pain.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes
#9864,Effect of Acupuncture on Functional Capacity and Health-Related Quality of Life of Hemodialysis Patients: Study Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial,"The proposed randomized controlled trial protocol will evaluate the effect of acupuncture treatment on the functional capacity (FC) and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in chronic kidney disease (CKD) with glomerular filtration rate (GFR) category 5 (CKG G5) patients receiving maintenance dialysis. Patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD) from a dialysis center will be randomly assigned to experimental, placebo and control groups. In order to determine the difference between the same number of treatments performed three times or one treatment a week, experimental (verum acupuncture) and placebo (sham acupuncture) groups will receive a total of nine acupuncture treatments; however, both groups will be divided into subgroups A and B. The same selection of acupuncture points will be applied to both experimental subgroups and the placebo subgroups will receive acupuncture on non-acupuncture points. The results will be assessed by the 6-min Walk Test, Handgrip Test, 30-sec Sit-to-Stand and Kidney Disease Quality of Life-Short Form and will be held at baseline, after treatment and 12 weeks post-treatment follow up. This paper describes the rationale and design for a randomized, patient-assessor blinded controlled trial, which may provide evidence for the clinical application of acupuncture in CKG G5 patients undergoing HD.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#9921,"Prolonged relief of pain by brief, intense transcutaneous somatic stimulation","The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of brief, intense transcutaneous electrical stimulations at trigger points or acupuncture points on severe clinical pain. The McGill Pain Questionnaire was used to measure the change in pain quality and intensity produced by stimulation. The data indicate that the procedure provides a powerful method for the control of some forms of severe pathological pain. The average pain decrease during stimulation sessions was 75% for pain due to peripheral nerve injury, 66% for phantom limb pain, 62% for shoulder-arm pain, and 60% for low-back pain. The duration of relief frequently outlasted the period of stimulation by several hours, occasionally for days or weeks. Different patterns of the amount and duration of pain relief were observed. Daily stimulation carried out at home by the patient sometimes provided gradually increasing relief over periods of weeks or months. Control experiments, which included two forms of placebo stimulation, showed that brief, intense electrical stimulation is significantly more effective than placebo contributions. Possible neural mechanisms that underlie these patterns of pain relief by brief, intense stimulation are discussed.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#9934,Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation in the relief of primary dysmenorrhea,"The purpose of this study was to replicate a previous study to determine the effectiveness of acupuncture-like transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation in treating primary dysmenorrhea. Twenty-one women with dysmenorrhea received a placebo pill or 30 minutes of acupuncture-like TENS. All subjects completed two pain questionnaires before treatment; immediately posttreatment; 30, 60, 120, and 180 minutes posttreatment; and the next morning upon awakening. Each woman also participated in a separate study measuring electrical resistance at four auricular acupuncture points before and immediately after treatment. The data were analyzed with a two-factor repeated-measures analysis of variance, which revealed statistical significance over time but not for group or interaction between group and time. Results revealed an average pain relief of at least 50% immediately posttreatment, indicating that acupuncture-like TENS may be useful for dysmenorrheic pain. This study also suggests that auriculotherapy via acupressure may relieve the pain of primary dysmenorrhea.",No,No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No
#9947,Effect of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation at auricular points on experimental cutaneous pain threshold,"The purposes of this study were 1) to examine the effect of high intensity, low frequency transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation at auricular acupuncture points on experimental pain threshold measured at the wrist and 2) to determine the changes in effect over time. Forty-four healthy adult men and women were assigned randomly to one of three treatment groups. Group 1 (n = 15) received TENS to appropriate auricular points for wrist pain, Group 2 (n = 14) received TENS to inappropriate (placebo) auricular points, and Group 3 (n = 15) received no TENS. We measured experimental pain threshold at the wrist after an electrical stimulus during one pretreatment and three posttreatment time periods. Group 1 was the only group that had a statistically significant increase (p less than .05) in pain threshold after testing. This increase remained significant for all posttreatment measurements for Group 1. These results suggest that high intensity, low frequency TENS applied to appropriate auricular acupuncture points can increase pain threshold.",No,No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No
#9978,Acupuncture for frozen-thawed embryo transfer cycles: a double-blind randomized controlled trial,"The role of acupuncture on the pregnancy rate has not been evaluated in frozen-thawed embryo transfer (FET) cycles. This randomized double-blind study aimed to determine whether acupuncture performed on the day of FET improves clinical outcomes. On the day of FET, 226 patients were randomly allocated to either real or placebo acupuncture according to a computer-generated randomization list in sealed opaque envelopes. They received a session of real or placebo acupuncture for 25 min on site immediately after FET. The anxiety level and serum cortisol concentration were evaluated before and after real and placebo acupuncture. There were no significant differences in rates of overall pregnancy, clinical pregnancy, ongoing pregnancy, live birth and implantation in the placebo acupuncture group, when compared with the real acupuncture group. The anxiety level and serum cortisol concentration were similar for both groups. Only the placebo acupuncture group had significantly higher ongoing pregnancy (P=0.022) and implantation rates (P=0.038) than those who declined to join the study and received no acupuncture. In conclusion, comparable pregnancy and live birth rates of FET treatment were found in patients who had one session of real or placebo acupuncture after FET.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes
#9999,[Midnight-noon ebb-flow acupuncture at stomach meridian of foot-yangming: a fMRI study],"The status change of brain functional region of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of midnight-noon ebb-flow acupuncture method at stomach meridian was explored. Ten healthy volunteers were recruited. With identical sequence of magnetic resonance scans, fMRI data was collected respectively in the timely acupoint group, untimely acupoint group and timely non-acupoint group. Volunteers in the timely acupoint group were treated at Zusanli (ST 36) and Chongyang (ST 42) between 7:02:53 A.M. to 9:02:52 A.M.; volunteers in the untimely acupoint group were treated with Zusanli (ST 36) and Chongyang (ST 42) between 3:02 P.M. to 5:02 P.M.; volunteers in the timely non-acupoint group were treated at non-acupoints 1 to 2 cm outside Zusanli (ST 36) and Chongyang (ST 42) between 7:02:53 A. M. to 9:02:52 A.M.. All fMRI data was analyzed with SPM5 software, and intra-group comparison and among-group comparison of timely acupoint group, untimely acupoint group and timely non-acupoint group were performed. The tonsil of cerebellum, the right-side insular cortex showed strengthened function in the timely acupoint group; the right-side medial frontal gyrus showed weakened function in the untimely acupoint group; the right-sided insular cortex showed strengthened function in the timely non-acupoint group. The comparison among groups indicated that there was different brain change in three groups. The midnight-noon ebb-flow acupuncture method at stomach meridian is likely to activate the function of cerebellum and insular lobe, which can have a positive effect on patients with flaccidity syndrome and stomach diseases.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#10001,Acupuncture and postoperative vomiting in day-stay paediatric patients,"The stimulation of the acupuncture point P6 has been used to prevent nausea and vomiting in the adult population. It has, however, been subject to limited comparative evaluation in children. We proposed that stimulation of P6 and the analgesic point Li4 would reduce the incidence of postoperative vomiting. Eighty-four unpremedicated paediatric patients having day-stay surgery (circumcision or herniotomy/orchidopexy) were included in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of transcutaneous stimulation of P6 and Li4, or no stimulation. The incidence of vomiting was recorded for 24 hours postoperatively. There was no statistically significant difference in total postoperative vomiting in those patients who were stimulated, compared with the control group (P = 0.909), or between any group for postoperative vomiting in the recovery ward, day-stay ward or at home. For all groups, vomiting was more common within the first four hours and more likely to occur in the day-stay ward.",No,No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No
#10023,Increase in plasma phylloquinone concentrations following acupoint injection for the treatment of primary dysmenorrhea,"The therapeutic benefits of acupoint injection of vitamin K in spleen-6 (SP6) for the treatment of primary dysmenorrhea have been observed in limited clinical settings. However, menadione, the form of vitamin K most studied for treating dysmenorrhea, is not routinely used in clinical practice in North America. As part of a larger clinical trial among women aged 18-25 years with primary dysmenorrhea, we conducted a substudy to test the plasma concentration of phylloquinone (vitamin K1). We collected blood samples from four women before and 24-48 hours after an acupoint injection of phylloquinone in SP6. Despite the rapid turnover of phylloquinone observed in previous studies, we found that the plasma phylloquinone concentrations increased significantly from preinjection to 1-2 days after the injection. Interestingly, higher phylloquinone concentrations were correlated with less pain intensity among women with dysmenorrhea. Additional research is needed to understand the association between vitamin K and menstrual pain, including the role of vitamin K deficiency in inflammation and pain, and on the possible mechanisms of acupoint injection of vitamin K for the treatment of primary dysmenorrhea.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#10024,Acupuncture for bronchial asthma? A double-blind crossover study,"The therapeutic effectiveness of classic Chinese acupuncture was compared with ""placebo"" acupuncture in 15 patients with stable bronchial asthma. The patients received treatments with real and placebo acupuncture in a randomly ordered, subject and evaluator-blind crossover fashion twice weekly for five weeks. Both real and placebo treatment periods were preceded by three week periods when no acupuncture was administered. Five patients felt better on real treatment, five patients preferred placebo and five did not feel any improvement on either of the two treatments. Treatment with real acupuncture when compared with no treatment and placebo treatment failed to provide any improvement in daily peak flow rates, asthma symptom scores, number of puffs of beta 2-agonist aerosol use, and pulmonary function results.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No

The extract was plastered and blistered on Dazhui, Neiguan point. It was observed by nasal mucosa provocative test, cells in nasal secretion test and serum total IgE test. The results showed that its effective rate was 88%, the allergic nasal mucosa provocative test of treated group alleviated obviously after the treatment (P < 0.01), the number of eosinophil and basophil in nasal secretion decreased (P < 0.01, P < 0.05); and the serum total IgE also reduced significantly (P < 0.01).",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#10044,Alternative and complementary therapies for the menopause,"The use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) among menopausal women has increased in the last years. This review examines the evidence from systematic reviews, RCTs and epidemiological studies of CAM in the treatment of menopausal symptoms. Some evidence exists in favour of phytosterols and phytostanols for diminishing LDL and total cholesterol in postmenopausal women. Similarly, regular fiber intake is effective in reducing serum total cholesterol in hypercholesterolemic postmenopausal women. Clinical evidence also exists on the effectiveness of vitamin K, a combination of calcium and vitamin D or a combination of walking with other weight-bearing exercise in reducing bone mineral density loss and the incidence of fractures in postmenopausal women. Black cohosh appears to be effective therapy for relieving menopausal symptoms, primarily hot flashes, in early menopause. Phytoestrogen extracts, including isoflavones and lignans, appear to have only minimal effect on hot flashes but have other positive health effects, e.g. on plasma lipid levels and bone loss. For other commonly used CAMs, e.g. probiotics, prebiotics, acupuncture, homeopathy and DHEA-S, randomized, placebo-controlled trials are scarce and the evidence is unconvincing. More and better RCTs testing the effectiveness of these treatments are needed.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#10082,Editorial: is adequate relief fatally flawed or adequate as an end point in irritable bowel syndrome?,"There is controversy on the validity of binary end points used in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) clinical trials. In a usual-care observational study, baseline severity influenced the response measured as satisfactory relief. This editorial reviews the observations from a non-pharmacological study to assess the effect of baseline severity on the performance of binary end points in large drug trials. The pivotal finding is that once the patients who reported adequate relief at baseline were excluded from the analysis, baseline severity no longer affected the proportion of patients reporting adequate relief of IBS with treatment. As large drug trials enriched the study cohorts for at least moderate severity after a no-treatment, run-in period, it seems likely that the precaution of excluding mild disease de facto resolved the hypothetical weakness of the adequate relief end point. Given the high responsiveness and longitudinal construct validity demonstrated with adequate relief end point, it should be accepted as a trial end point.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#10086,Physical and other non-pharmacological interventions for fibromyalgia,"There is little empirical evidence for the effectiveness of physical and other non-pharmacological approaches to the management of fibromyalgia. Although a number of studies have been conducted into such approaches, many of these are uncontrolled, and relatively few randomized controlled trials of appropriate size and methodological rigour have been carried out. This chapter provides an overview of the evidence available under the following headings: exercise, EMG biofeedback training, electrotherapy and acupuncture, patient education and self-management programmes, multimodal treatment approaches, and other interventions. It is hard to reach firm conclusions from the literature, owing to the variety of interventions that have been evaluated and the varying methodological quality of the studies concerned. Nonetheless, in terms of specific interventions, exercise therapy has received a moderate degree of support from the literature, and has been subjected to more randomized studies than any other intervention. In contrast, there is little or no evidence available for most types of electrotherapy. In terms of overall management strategies, a multimodal programme of management, including physical, psychological and educational components and delivered in a multidisciplinary setting, has gained some support from descriptive and experimental studies, and accords with current understanding of the aetiology and clinical features of fibromyalgia. There is a clear need for further systematic evaluation of the effectiveness of non-pharmacological treatment approaches in fibromyalgia.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#10104,Acupuncture of different treatment frequencies in knee osteoarthritis: a pilot randomised controlled trial,"This 16-week randomised controlled trial (8-week treatment followed by 8-week follow-up) evaluated the symptomatic improvement in patients with knee osteoarthritis on 3 sessions per week of acupuncture (TSWA) compared to 1 session per week of acupuncture (OSWA). Sixty participants were randomised to either the TSWA or the OSWA group in a 1:1 ratio. The primary outcome was response rate, defined as the percentage of participants achieving ≥2 points decrease on the numerical rating scale (NRS) and ≥6 points decrease in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) function score at week 8 compared with baseline. Additional outcomes included response rates at weeks 4 and 16, NRS, WOMAC, Patient Global Assessment, 12-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12), and treatment credibility and expectancy. No significant difference was seen in response rate between TSWA and OSWA groups at week 8 (64.7% vs 50.0%; difference, 14.7 percentage points [95% CI, -10.1 to 39.4 percentage points], P = 0.435). At weeks 4 and 16, the TSWA group had higher response rates than the OSWA group (week-4: difference, 44.7 percentage points [95% CI, 23.2-66.1 percentage points], P = 0.001; week-16: difference, 46.0 percentage points [95% CI, 24.4-67.6 percentage points], P < 0.001). Participants in the TSWA group experienced significantly greater improvements in NRS, WOMAC function, and Patient Global Assessment than those in the OSWA group. There were no significant between-group differences in WOMAC stiffness and SF-12. In summary, TSWA immediately improved knee pain and dysfunction compared with OSWA. In addition, the benefit of TSWA persists throughout follow-up.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes
#10107,Rehabilitation in rheumatoid arthritis: a critical review,"This article considers the evidence for effectiveness and timing of rehabilitation for people with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The Cochrane Library, DARE, Medline, Embase, CINAHL and AMED were searched to identify systematic reviews and randomized controlled trials evaluating rehabilitation interventions for people with rheumatoid arthritis. Many trials identified had methodological limitations (e.g. short follow-up periods, small sample sizes). Evidence to date is that symptomatic relief results from thermotherapy, laser therapy, acupuncture and assistive devices. In the short-term, comprehensive occupational therapy (in established rheumatoid arthritis), orthoses, and mind-body approaches can help maintain function. Over at least a one-year period, the following are effective in reducing pain and maintaining function: patient education and joint protection training using behavioural approaches; dynamic exercise therapy, hand exercises and hydrotherapy; and cognitive-behavioural therapy (in people with poorer psychological status). Many trials have recruited people with moderate to severe, established RA and relatively little is known about the long-term effectiveness of early rehabilitation, although this is becoming much more common in practice. Despite the increased availability of guidelines and systematic reviews, most conclude there is insufficient evidence for many areas of rheumatology rehabilitation. Further well-designed clinical trials are needed recruiting people with early disease using patient-centred outcomes.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#10153,[Effect of acupuncture on interleukin-2 level and NK cell immunoactivity of peripheral blood of malignant tumor patients],"This paper deals with the observation of acupuncture therapy affecting interleukin-2(IL-2 level and natural killer (NK) cell immunoactivity in the peripheral blood of patients with malignant tumors. In this clinical-laboratory test research, randomized double blind method was used. The patients were divided into an acupuncture treated group (n = 25) and a control group (n = 20). The former group was treated using points, ST36,LI11,RN6 and locations of symptomatic points bilaterally. They received one treatment of 30 minutes daily for 10 days. The results showed that the IL-2 level and NK cell activity were lower than normal in patients with malignant tumor, but there was an increase in the acupuncture group after 10 days of treatment. Significance was found to be remarkable (P < 0.01). The difference between the two groups was also significant (P < 0.01). This increase might be related to the mechanism of acupuncture that adjusting the body's immune function. Thus, acupuncture therapy could enhance the cellular immune function of patients with malignant tumors and providing a beneficial effect in anti-cancer treatment.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes
#10159,"[Improving acupuncture research: progress, guidance, and future directions]","This paper makes an interpretation of the collection Acupuncture: how to improve the evidence base published by BMJ & BMJ Open. Studies show that the quality of randomized controlled trial (RCT) of acupuncture is low, and multivariable Meta-regression analysis fails to confirm most factors commonly believed to influence the effect of acupuncture. The methodological challenges in design and conduct of RCT in acupuncture were analyzed, and a consensus on how to design high-quality acupuncture RCT was developed. The number of acupuncture systematic reviews was huge but the evidence was underused in clinical practice and health policy, and a large number of western clinical practice guidelines recommended acupuncture therapy, but the usefulness of recommendations needed to be improved. In view of the problems in clinical research on acupuncture mentioned in this collection, combined with the analysis of the purpose of clinical research on acupuncture, perspectives, study types, as well as the relationship between evidence and clinical decision-making, a five-stage study paradigm of clinical research on acupuncture is proposed.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#10163,Therapies in practice: a survey assessing nurses' use of complementary therapies,"This paper reports the findings of an informal survey to assess nurses' use of complementary therapies within the health care setting. Increasing interest amongst the general public and health care professionals appears to have resulted in an assumption that there is currently widespread use of therapies such as massage, homoeopathy, aromatherapy, reflexology and acupuncture within the health care setting. However, to date there have been no national research studies undertaken to substantiate this assumption. This study attempted to identify the range of practices and magnitude of use by nurses who are members of the Royal College of Nursing Complementary Therapy Forum (RCNCTF) UK. A convenience sample was used and a semi-structured questionnaire was inserted into the group's bi-annual newsletter and sent to all members of the RCNCTF (n = 1662). A total of 178 subjects completed and returned the questionnaire, representing a 9.3% response rate. Given the informal nature of this survey, and the fact that it was an insert in a newsletter, a relatively low response was anticipated. Contrary to expectation, findings indicated that the majority of respondents were aged between 41 and 50 years. The six principal therapies practised were (in order of use) massage, aromatherapy, reflexology, relaxation, visualization and acupuncture. The three most common areas of practice, both in the NHS and private sector, were in the community, palliative care and oncology. Findings also indicated that complementary therapies were more commonly practised in the private sector as part of formal working practice. This was in contrast to nurses working in the NHS, where complementary therapies appeared to form less than 20% of their formal nursing care and respondents indicated that, when used, it was often in addition to daily nursing care. Results indicate that nurses are practising complementary therapies less than has been assumed. Those therapies commonly practised form a broader mantle than therapies commonly presented as the primary therapies in complementary medicine, namely homoeopathy, acupuncture, herbalism, chiropractic and osteopathy. This survey represents a single snapshot of nurses' use of complementary therapies. The convenience sample focused upon a self-selected group of people who were members of the RCNCTF and this has to be borne in mind when considering the results. The intention is to report the findings and no attempt is made to generalize upon the results. However, there is clearly a need to identify national utilization of complementary therapies within the health care sector.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#10169,Effect of acupressure on nausea and vomiting during pregnancy,"This paper sought to determine the efficacy of acupressure application in pregnant women suffering from nausea, with or without associated vomiting, who were unable to receive conventional medication for these symptoms. Sampling consisted of pregnant women complaining of nausea with or without vomiting. The study was controlled by the Maternity and Child Hospital in Istanbul between March 2004 and March 2005. The treatment group comprised 26 women; 25 in the control arm and 24 women were assigned to the placebo arm. The study occurred over a 9-day period. During this time, the treatment group applied acupressure bands to P(6) acupressure point on days 4-6 of the study with the placebo group receiving acupressure bands to a sham acupressure point, on the upper side of their wrists. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Acupressure would appear to be effective in symptom control, and alleviation and placebo effects in reducing the symptoms of nausea and vomiting during pregnancy.",No,No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No
#10185,Acupuncture on the day of embryo transfer: a randomized controlled trial of 635 patients,"This prospective, randomized, controlled and double-blinded trial studied whether acupuncture in relation to embryo transfer could increase the ongoing pregnancy rates and live birth rates in women undergoing assisted reproductive therapy. A total of 635 patients undergoing IVF or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) were included. In 314 patients, embryo transfer was accompanied by acupuncture according to the principles of traditional Chinese medicine. In the control group, 321 patients received placebo acupuncture using a validated placebo needle. In the acupuncture group and the placebo group, the ongoing pregnancy rates were 27% (95% CI 22-32) and 32% (95% CI 27-37), respectively. Live birth rates were 25% (95% CI 20-30) in the acupuncture group and 30% (95% CI 25-30) in the placebo group. The differences were not statistically significant. These results suggest that acupuncture administered in relation to embryo transfer has no effect on the outcome of IVF and ICSI.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes
#10186,Is acupuncture analgesia an expectancy effect? Preliminary evidence based on participants' perceived assignments in two placebo-controlled trials,"This purpose of this article is to contrast the analgesic efficacy of acupuncture following dental surgery with the analgesic effects based on the expectation of benefit in two independently conducted placebo-controlled trials evaluating acupuncture as an adjunctive therapy for dental surgery. Both trials used pain following dental surgery as the outcome variable, and both included a blinding check to ascertain patients' beliefs regarding which treatment they were receiving. Although no statistically significant analgesic effect was observed between the acupuncture and placebo groups, participants in both experiments who believed they received real acupuncture reported significantly less pain than patients who believed that they received a placebo. Patients' beliefs regarding the receipt of acupuncture bore a stronger relationship to pain than any specific action possessed by acupuncture. These results also support the importance of both employing credible controls for the placebo effect in clinical trials and evaluating the credibility of those controls.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes
#10199,A case study on acupuncture in the treatment of schizophrenia,"This report describes the use of acupuncture as an add on treatment for a patient with chronic schizophrenia. The 63-year-old woman suffered from persistent hallucinations and even physical pain as a result of the hallucination of a black bird that kept pecking her back. The patient received 12 weekly acupuncture treatments. A clinical diagnostic interview and psychological testing (on sleep quality, depression, and on positive and negative symptoms) were conducted before, immediately after and 3 months after the acupuncture treatment. The results of the diagnostic interview gave important insights into the treatment effects. The patient experienced improved daily functioning and noticed a change in hallucinations. Although the hallucinations still occurred, she felt less disturbed by them. Interestingly, pain decreased markedly. In addition, the results showed that the overall score of the positive and negative symptoms did not change immediately; however, a decrease in symptoms occurred 3 months after acupuncture treatment. Moreover, the patient described an immediate improvement in sleep; this was confirmed by a daytime sleepiness questionnaire. The patient was not able to complete a (longer) test on sleep quality beforehand but did so after the treatment period. Finally, a delayed improvement in the depression scale was found. Although larger clinical intervention studies on acupuncture and schizophrenia are needed, the results of this case study indicate that acupuncture may be beneficial as an add on treatment tool in patients with schizophrenia.

Clinical data of 115 pediatric patients with GHD were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were categorized into two distinct groups for the analysis: The conventional GH treatment group (n=62) and the combined group of acupoint transdermal therapy alongside GH treatment (n=53). Baseline characteristics, hormone levels, bone mineral density (BMD), physical growth parameters and adverse events were compared. The baseline characteristics of the two groups were well-matched. After one year of treatment, the combined group showed significantly lower levels of insulin-like growth factor-1 (P<0.001), testosterone (P<0.001), estrogen (P<0.001), thyroid-stimulating hormone (P<0.001), insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (P=0.009) and free thyroxine (P<0.001) compared to the conventional group. The transdermal treatment group demonstrated significantly higher BMD at multiple sites (P<0.05) and improved physical growth parameters (P<0.05) compared to the conventional group. Furthermore, the transdermal treatment was not linked to a higher occurrence of adverse incidents and showed significant correlations with various growth and development indexes (P<0.05). Combined therapy showed promising effects on endocrine function and physical growth.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#10212,Effectiveness of electroacupuncture for the treatment of sudden sensorineural hearing loss: A retrospective study,"This retrospective study investigated the use of electroacupuncture (EA) for the treatment of patients with sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL).Between May 2016 and April 2020, 140 patients with SSNHL were retrospectively analyzed. They were allocated to a treatment group (n = 70, received EA) and a control group (n = 70, received acupuncture). They received EA or acupuncture for a total of 3 months. The outcomes included average hearing threshold (AHT), tinnitus (as assessed by tinnitus handicap inventory [THI]), dizziness (as measured by dizziness handicap inventory [DHI]), and adverse events (AEs).After treatment, patients in both groups exerted more reduction in HT (P < .01), THI (P < .01), and DHI (P < .01), than those before the treatment. Furthermore, patients in the treatment group showed more relief in HT (P < .01), THI (P < .01), and DHI (P < .01), than those of patients in the control group. When it comes to AEs, both modalities had similar safety profile.The findings of this retrospective study indicated that the effectiveness of EA is superior to acupuncture in treating SSNHL. Future high quality studies are needed to warrant the present findings.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#10218,A meta-analysis of acupuncture combined with opioid receptor agonists for treatment of opiate-withdrawal symptoms,"This review extends a prior meta-analysis of acupuncture's utility for treating opioid detoxification, addressing the efficacy of acupuncture when combined with allopathic therapies. Both English and Chinese databases were searched for randomized trials comparing acupuncture combined with opioid agonist treatment versus opioid agonists alone for treating symptoms of opioid withdrawal. The methodological quality of each study was assessed with Jadad's scale (1-2 = low; 3-5 = high). Meta-analysis was performed with fixed- or random-effect models in RevMan software; the outcome measures assessed were withdrawal-symptoms score, relapse rate, side effects, and medication dosage. Withdrawal-symptom scores were lower in combined treatment trials than in agonist-alone trials on withdrawal days 1, 7, 9, and 10. Combined treatment also produced lower reported rates of side effects and appeared to lower the required dose of opioid agonist. There was no significant difference on relapse rate after 6 months. This meta-analysis suggests that acupuncture combined with opioid agonists can effectively be used to manage the withdrawal symptoms. One limitation of this meta-analysis is the poor quality of the methodology of some included trials. High-quality studies are needed to confirm findings regarding the side effects and medication dosage.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#10235,Acute Effects of Different Electroacupuncture Point Combinations to Modulate the Gut-Brain Axis in the Minipig Model,"This study aimed to compare the gut-brain axis responses to acute electroacupuncture (EA) at different acupoint combinations in the minipig model. Four adult Yucatan minipigs were subjected twice to four acute EA treatments (25-minute acute sessions) including sham (false acupoints) and control (no EA), during anesthesia and according to a Latin-square design paradigm. Acupoint combinations (4 loci each) are head-abdomen (#70 Dafengmen, #35 Sanwan), back (bilateral #27 Pishu, #28 Weishu), leg (bilateral #79 Hangou, #63 Housanli), and sham (2 bilateral points that are not acupoints). Electrocardiograms were performed to explore heart rate variability (HRV). Infrared thermography was used to measure skin temperature at the stimulation points. Saliva (cortisol) and blood samples (leptin, total/active ghrelin, insulin, and glucose) were collected for further analyses before and after acute EA. All animals were also subjected to BOLD fMRI to investigate the brain responses to EA. Acute EA significantly modulated several physiological and metabolic parameters compared to basal, sham, and/or control conditions, with contrasting effects in terms of BOLD responses in brain regions involved in the hedonic and cognitive control of food intake. The head-abdomen combination appeared to be the most promising combination in terms of brain modulation of the corticostriatal circuit, with upregulation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, dorsal striatum, and anterior cingulate cortex. It also induced significantly lower plasma ghrelin levels compared to sham, suggesting anorectic effects, as well as no temperature drop at the stimulation site. This study opens the way to a further preclinical trial aimed at investigating chronic EA in obese minipigs.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#10262,Clinical Effect of Electroacupuncture on Lung Injury Patients Caused by Severe Acute Pancreatitis,"This study aimed to investigate the effects of electroacupuncture at the Lieque, Chize, and Zusanli points in patients with lung injury caused by severe acute pancreatitis. Patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) induced by severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) were randomly divided into three groups based on the treatment: conventional therapy alone (group A), electroacupuncture of nonacupoints with conventional therapy (group B), and electroacupuncture at the Lieque (LU7), Chize (LU5), and Zusanli (ST36) points (group C) once a day for 5 days. Arterial blood samples were obtained for blood gas analysis before electroacupuncture (T1) and 3 (T2) and 5 (T3) days after electroacupuncture. The oxygenation index was significantly higher in all groups at T2 and T3 than that at T1, while the APACHE-II scores were decreased significantly. The expression of TNF-α was significantly decreased and the IL-10 was significantly increased in all groups at T3. The oxygenation index at T2 and T3 was significantly higher in group C than that in group B. Electroacupuncture at Lieque, Chize, and Zusanli can lessen the lung injury induced by SAP, and the mechanism may be related to the decreased TNF-α and increased IL-10 value.

#10291,Electromyographic and strength analyses of activation patterns of the wrist flexor muscles after acupuncture,"This study analyzed the electromyographic and strength responses of the flexor muscles of the wrist following stimulation of acupuncture points. A total of 52 participants were randomly divided into four groups: local (heart 3, HT3), distant (heart 4, HT4), control (bladder 60, BL60), and naïve control groups. To obtain the root mean square electromyographic activity, we placed surface electrodes over the wrist flexors. To obtain kilogram force (kgf) values, we attached a force transducer to the floor and to the hands of participants. Both values were recorded over three repetitions of maximal isometric wrist flexion contractions. Data were analyzed using one-way analyses of variance, followed by Dunnett's post-hoc tests. We found reductions in electromyographic activity contralateral to the stimulated point in the distant group 10 minutes after removal of the needles (F(3,48) = 3.25; p < 0.05). Regarding muscle strength, ipsilateral and contralateral stimulation in the distant group produced kgf levels prior to and 10 minute and 20 minutes after withdrawal of the acupuncture needle that were lower than that obtained prior to insertion of the needle (F(3,48) = 5.82; p < 0.05). Thus, stimulation of the acupuncture points distant from the wrist flexors reduced ipsilateral and contralateral muscle strength and decreased the root mean square values contralateral to the site of stimulation.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes
#10293,"Repeatability and comparability of automated keratometry: the Nikon NRK-8000, the Nidek KM-800 and the Bausch and Lomb keratometer","This study assessed the repeatability of the Nikon NRK-8000, the Nidek KM-800 and the Bausch and Lomb keratometer. In addition, the comparability of the Nikon NRK-8000 and the Nidek KM-800 are evaluated relative to the Bausch and Lomb keratometer. Measurements were taken with all three techniques on two separate occasions with a test-retest separation of at least 24 hr. The right eyes of 30 normal subjects were used. Repeatability and comparability statistics and plots were generated using matrix representations of dioptric power. The Nidek KM-800 coefficient of repeatability values were found to be 0.345, 0.187, and 0.321 in the vertical, torsional, and horizontal meridians while the Nikon NRK-8000 values were 0.346, 0.232, and 0.276 respectively.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#10294,Maternal sleep and depressive symptoms: links with infant Negative Affectivity,"This study assessed whether elevated severities of maternal depression and disturbed maternal sleep would be associated with maternal perceptions of higher Negative Affectivity of her infant. Sixty-nine mothers participated in this study. The study was part of a larger randomized controlled study testing the efficacy of acupuncture as a treatment for depression during pregnancy. The present study focused on data collected at 6 months postpartum in a naturalistic follow-up design, using the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD), maternal sleep diaries (completed daily for 1 week), and the Infant Behavior Questionnaire-Revised (IBQ-R). Regression analyses revealed that (a) maternal depression severity was a significant predictor of the IBQ-R Distress and Falling Reactivity scales and (b) poor maternal sleep was a significant predictor of the IBQ-R Sadness scale. Our findings support previous findings of significant links between maternal emotional distress and perceived Negative Affectivity of her infant's temperament and provide a novel insight linking maternal poor sleep with perceived sadness of the infant.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No
#10297,Effects of unilateral and bilateral auricular transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation on cutaneous pain threshold,"This study compared the effects of unilateral and bilateral auricular transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation on cutaneous pain threshold. Auricular acupuncture points were stimulated with low frequency, high intensity TENS for 45 seconds. Sixty healthy, adult subjects were assigned randomly to one of two treatment groups or to a control group. The two treatment groups received low frequency, high intensity TENS either unilaterally or bilaterally. The control group did not receive auricular stimulation. Experimental pain threshold at the left wrist was determined with a painful stimulus before and after auricular stimulation. Both unilateral and bilateral auricular stimulation groups exhibited a significant increase (p less than .05) in experimental pain threshold, but the control group did not. The mean change values between the unilateral and bilateral stimulation groups were not statistically different. These results suggest that both unilateral and bilateral auricular TENS can increase pain threshold.",No,No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No
#10306,Mode and site of acupuncture modulation in the human brain: 3D (124-ch) EEG power spectrum mapping and source imaging,"This study determined: (a) if acupuncture stimulation at a traditional site might modulate ongoing EEG as compared with stimulation of a control site; (b) if high-frequency vs. low-frequency stimulation could exert differential effects of acupuncture; (c) if the observed effects of acupuncture were specific to certain EEG bands; and (d) if the acupuncture effect could be isolated at a specific scalp field, with its putative underlying intracranial source. Twelve healthy male volunteers (age range 22-35) participated in two experimental sessions separated by 1 week, which involved transcutaneous acupoint stimulation at selected acupoint (Li 4, HeGu) vs. a mock point at the fourth interosseous muscle area on the left hand in high (HF: 100 Hz) vs. low-frequency (LF: 2 Hz) stimulation by counter-balanced order. 124-ch EEG data were used to analyze the Delta, Theta, Alpha-1, Alpha-2, Beta, and Gamma bands. The absolute EEG powers (muv2) at focal maxima across three stages (baseline, stimulation, post) were examined by two-way (condition, stage) repeated measures ANOVA. The activity of the Theta power significantly decreased (P = 0.02), compared with control during HF but not LF stimulation at acupoint stimulation, however, there was no study effect at the mock point. A decreased Theta EEG power was prominent at the frontal midline sites (FCz, Fz) and the contralateral right hemisphere front site (FCC2h). In contrast, the Theta power of low-frequency stimulation showed an increase from the baseline as those in both controlled mock point stimulations. The observed high-frequency acupoint stimulation effects of Theta EEG were only present during, but not after, simulation. The topographic Theta activity was tentatively identified to originate from the intracranial current source in cingulate cortex, likely ACC. It is likely that short-term cortical plasticity occurs during high-frequency but not low-frequency stimulation at the HeGu point, but not mock point. We suggest that HeGu acupuncture stimulation modulates limbic cingulum by a frequency modulation mode, which then may damp nociceptive processing in the brain.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#10307,"Regional distribution of antibodies to herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and HSV-2 in men and women in Ontario, Canada","This study estimated the regional and age- and gender-specific seroprevalences of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and HSV-2 in Ontario, Canada. Stored serum specimens from subjects aged 15 to 44 years, including men (n = 979), women not under prenatal care (n = 638), and women under prenatal care (n = 701) submitted for routine viral serology were randomly selected according to regional population size from public health laboratories. HSV-1 and HSV-2 testing was done with the MRL enzyme immunoassay (EIA) (Focus Technologies), and HSV-2 was also tested by the Gull/Meridian EIA. Specimens discordant for HSV-2 antibodies between the two EIAs were resolved by a recombinant immunoblot assay (Focus Technologies). The overall age- and gender-standardized seroprevalences of HSV-1 and HSV-2 were 51.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 50.1 to 52.1) and 9.1% (95% CI, 8.6 to 9.7), respectively. The seroprevalence of HSV-1 antibodies increased from 26.9 to 54.7% in men between 15 to 16 and 40 to 44 years of age, from 32.0 to 88.7% in women not under prenatal care, and from 55.2 to 69.2% in women under prenatal care. The seroprevalence of HSV-2 increased from 3.8 to 21.3% in men between 15 to 16 and 40 to 44 years of age, from 0 to 18.9% in women not under prenatal care, and from 3.4 to 23.1% in women under prenatal care. HSV-2 results were discordant for 3.3% (76 of 2,318) of specimens. Both types of HSV antibodies appeared to be acquired earlier among women under prenatal care than among men and women not under prenatal care. Antibodies were more prevalent among people in northern Ontario (72.9% of subjects [range, 68.4 to 77.4%] for HSV-1 and 13.7% of subjects [95% CI, 10.2 to 17.2%] for HSV-2) than elsewhere.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#10328,Pain threshold responses to two different modes of sensory stimulation in patients with orofacial muscular pain: psychologic considerations,"This study focuses on the influence of trait anxiety and mood variables on changes in tooth pain threshold following two similar methods of somatic afferent stimulation, one familiar (manual acupuncture) and one unfamiliar (low-frequency transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation [low-TENS]). Twenty-one acupuncture responders, treated for long-lasting orofacial muscular pain but naive to low-TENS, were selected for the study. In an experimental session, acupuncture and low-TENS were randomly given during two periods separated by a rest interval. Tooth pain thresholds (PT) were measured before and after stimulation with a computerized electrical pulp tester. Trait anxiety and depression were assessed with psychometric forms before the experimental session in all patients, whereas momentary mood was assessed in 10 randomly selected patients with visual analogue scales during and after the two types of stimulation. Following acupuncture, the group average PT increased significantly, whereas no significant change was observed following low-TENS. Higher scores on trait anxiety correlated significantly with a low PT increase following low-TENS, and higher ratings of stress correlated significantly with a low PT increase following acupuncture. This indicates that the magnitude of analgesia induced by these methods may be modified by psychologic factors like anxiety and stress.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#10337,A preliminary study of the effect of acupuncture on emotional stress in female dysphonic speakers,"This study investigated the effect of acupuncture on emotional stress in subjects with phonotraumatic injuries. This study used a prospective randomized, placebo-controlled group design. The independent variable included the types of acupuncture (genuine vs sham) and the sampling time points (two pre-needling, one in the midway of needling, and two post-needling measurements). The dependent variable was the concentration of cortisol obtained from subjects' saliva samples. Eighteen female subjects with phonotraumatic injuries were randomized to receive either genuine or sham acupuncture at the same acupoints during a 30-minute session. Saliva samples were collected from each subject at 10 minutes pre-needling, immediately pre-needling, mid-needling, immediately postneedling, and 10 minutes post-needling time points. The findings suggested that the subjects' salivary cortisol concentration did not reduce after acupuncture, and thus, acupuncture may not be able to reduce the emotional stress level in female dysphonic speakers.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes
#10340,Combined acupuncture and general anesthesia on immune and cognitive function in elderly patients following subtotal gastrectomy for gastric cancer,"This study investigated the effects of acupuncture combined with general anesthesia on postoperative immune and cognitive functions in elderly patients undergoing subtotal gastrectomy. We recruited 96 elderly patients who received anesthesia for subtotal gastrectomy and randomly divided them into control (n=48) and experimental (n=48) groups. The control group received general anesthesia and the experimental group received combined acupuncture and general anesthesia. We measured hemodynamic immediately before and after anesthesia induction, and immune observations before and after surgery. We found no significant differences in mean heart rate (HR), mean oxygen saturation (SpO2), and partial pressure of end-tidal carbon dioxide (PETCO2) in the perioperative period between the two groups. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) was lower in the experimental group than that in the control group (P<0.05). The levels of cluster of differentiation 3 (CD3(+)), CD4(+) and CD4(+)/CD8(+) in both groups were significantly lower after surgery in both groups (P<0.05). We also found some time-points in which the immune markers where significantly higher in the experimental group. In terms of adverse reactions, there were no differences in nausea, vomiting, and hypoxemia between the two groups (P>0.05), but the incidence of delayed recovery and postoperative agitation were significantly lower in the experimental group compared with those in the control group (P<0.05). One day after surgery, the experimental group showed better protection of cognitive function than the control group (P<0.05). Overall, combined acupuncture and general anesthesia in elderly gastric cancer patients receiving subtotal gastrectomy showed more stable hemodynamics and fewer stress responses during surgery. Thus, combined acupuncture and general anesthesia can shorten the recovery time from anesthesia, have less negative effects on immune function and decrease the incidence of postoperative cognitive impairment.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes
#10348,Effectiveness of Acupuncture Therapy on Stress in a Large Urban College Population,"This study is a randomized controlled clinical trial to study the effectiveness of acupuncture on the perception of stress in patients who study or work on a large, urban college campus. The hypothesis was that verum acupuncture would demonstrate a significant positive impact on perceived stress as compared to sham acupuncture. This study included 111 participants with high self-reported stress levels who either studied or worked at a large, urban public university in the southwestern United States. However, only 62 participants completed the study. The participants were randomized into a verum acupuncture or sham acupuncture group. Both the groups received treatment once a week for 12 weeks. The Cohen's global measure of perceived stress scale (PSS-14) was completed by each participant prior to treatment, at 6 weeks, at 12 weeks, and 6 weeks and 12 weeks post-treatment completion. While participants of both the groups showed a substantial initial decrease in perceived stress scores, at 12 weeks post treatment, the verum acupuncture group showed a significantly greater treatment effect than the sham acupuncture group. This study indicates that acupuncture may be successful in decreasing the perception of stress in students and staff at a large urban university, and this effect persists for at least 3 months after the completion of treatment.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes

The EHF-98B MMW. RL compound therapy apparatus made in the University of Electronic Technology(Chengdu) was used in 171 patients. The superficial, skin lesions or the visceral reflected skin regions (acupoints) were directly exposed to the light from the apparatus. All the cases were divided into five groups, namely skin mucosa superficial lesions, trauma of the bone and joint soft tissue, surgical incision, ENT infections, and rare intricate diseases. The therapeutic effects observed in the groups were analyzed and evaluated by means of 4 levels. As for the 171 patients, the cure rate was 42.7% (73 patients), the effective rate 25.1%(43 patients), the improvement rate 31%(53 patients), and no effect constituted 1.2%(2 patients). The total effective rate was 98.8%. This therapy was especially effective for treating chronic cervicitis, cervical erosion, soft tissue trauma, surgical incision. Also it was effective for treating some rare intricate diseases, e.g. sterility, vitiligo, Behcet disease.

#10356,Temporal and spatial growth patterns in the normal and cataractous human lens,"This study presents a computational model of the growth of the normal human lens and the induction of spoke-like cortical cataract in the aging lens. The anterior lens is modelled as a 2-D disk with a circumferential germinative zone. Lens cortical fibre cells in the same generation cover the surface in three identical 120 deg growth wedge-shaped sectors, with centre cardinal fibres at the 90, 210 and 330 deg meridians. In the foetal lens all primary fibre cells begin to elongate simultaneously. Anterior migration is spatially asynchronous, where the centre fibre begins to move towards the anterior pole first. The fibres at the end of the sector move last in the anterior direction. Fibre elongation advanced at constant speed until the boundary of the sector is reached. Spatio-temporal asynchrony and random fluctuations were increased for the adult lens. The model foetal lens evolved Y-shaped sutures anteriorly, and an inverted Y-shaped posteriorly. Fibre length varied periodically with meridional angle. The adult lens displayed irregular growth. If clusters of germinative cells are caused to opacify the resultant opacities are predominantly spoke-shaped. The model mimics crystalline lens fibre growth to the extent of successfully evolving lens sutures. Fluctuations in lens mass are consistent with an ordered pattern of growth. Lens senescence includes a progressive loss of spatio-temporal synchrony in fibre migration from the germinative zone. Peripheral light focusing by the anterior eye is a possible explanation for the nasal predilection and cuneiform shape of age-related cortical cataract.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No

#10382,Effects of electroacupuncture on cognitive function in rats with Parkinson's disease,"This study was designed to illustrate the effects of electroacupuncture on cognitive function in rats with Parkinson's disease (PD). The PD model was established by injecting 6-OHDA into the rat brain. Rats with PD were then subjected to electroacupuncture and levodopa treatment for 2 weeks. The level of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity in rat brain homogenates was assessed, for the cerebral cholinergic system is a major chemical pathway consisting of cognitive functions. Immunohistochemistry was applied to observe ChAT expression in the rat hippocampus and corpus striatum. The effects of electroacupuncture on cognitive function were comprehensively assessed in PD rats using Y-maze test. Compared with model control group, electroacupuncture group were apparently improved in learning & memory abilities, and ChAT activity was elevated, and apoptosis was reduced in the rat hippocampus and corpus striatum. No significant differences in learning & memory abilities and ChAT activity were detected between electroacupuncture and levodopa groups. Electroacupuncture remarkably improved cognition in PD rats, and its mechanisms are possibly associated with protecting cholinergic neurons in the central nervous system and elevating ChAT activity, and also might suitable dosage of levodopa protect physiologically the cognitive function in PD rats.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#10417,To evaluate the effects of artificial tears on ocular biological parameters in dry eye and non-dry eye patients,"To analyze the changes in ocular biometry readings in patients with dry eye (DE) and non-dry eye (NDE) after instilling artificial tear drop (ATD). A prospective study was conducted on 98 eyes of 98 patients (DE group, n = 54 eyes; NDE group, n = 44 eyes) who underwent ocular biometry with four consecutive measurements using the IOL Master 700. The baseline flat meridian of the anterior corneal surface (K1), steep meridian of the anterior corneal surface (K2), corneal curvature radius(R1, R2), axial length (AL), anterior chamber depth (ACD), central corneal thickness (CCT), white-to-white corneal diameter (WTW), pupil diameter, non-invasive tear break-up time (NITBUT) and tear meniscus height, (TMH) was measured at baseline, 30-s, 2-min, and 5-min intervals after instilling one drop of ATD. Variability in biometry measurements was assessed and compared. The mean age of the NDE group and DE group was 27.09 ± 10.21 years (30 females, 68.18%) and 29.96 ± 12.08 years (38 females, 70.37%), respectively. Following the application of ATD, intergroup comparisons revealed significant changes in K1 at 2 min and 5 min (p = 0.043, p = 0.043, and p = 0.038, respectively), and significant changes in R1 and R2 at 2 min. Intragroup comparisons showed that AL exhibited significant changes at 30 s (p < 0.001), while CCT demonstrated significant alterations across all time points (p < 0.001). Changes in ACD were observed at 30 s and 2 min in the dry eye group, and pupil diameter showed significant changes at 2 min in both the DE and NDE groups. No significant changes were detected in WTW at any point (all p > 0.05). Artificial tears significantly affect the readings of AL and CCT during ocular biometry.

#10418,[Pattern of acupoint selection based on complex network analysis technique],"To analyze the global structural models of point prescription in acupuncture therapy, and to provide new insights for acupoint selection based on syndrome differentiation. Taking prescriptions in the commonly used textbooks as the resources, a directed network of point prescription according to syndrome differentiation was constructed. The network was visualized with Pajek 1.25, the linkage distributions of points and symptoms were analyzed with Matlab 7.0. The result showed that there existed 1 635 combinations between 233 syndromes and 232 acupoints. The linkages of symptoms and selection of acupoints confirmed to the feature of random distribution with 5 points for each symptom in average. And the linkages obeyed a power-law distribution, which indicates that most symptoms can be treated by selecting a few points. Thus, it was concluded that complexity can be found in the global structural of relation between syndrome differentiation and acupoint selection. The selection of acupoints for every symptom and the matching of symptoms for every acupoint had different distribution patterns. The former obeyed a random pattern while the latter had a scale-free property.

#10423,Quality of life and cost-effectiveness of acupuncture treatment in patients with osteoarthritis pain,"To assess quality of life (QoL), costs, and cost-effectiveness of acupuncture treatment plus routine care versus routine care alone in osteoarthritis patients, a randomised, controlled trial was conducted in 255 general practices in Germany. Four hundred and eighty-nine patients with chronic pain due to osteoarthritis of the knee or hip were included to evaluated QoL and costs at baseline and after 3 months using health insurance funds data and standardized questionnaires. Patients receiving acupuncture had an improved QoL associated with significantly higher costs over the 3 months treatment period compared to routine care alone (mean cost-difference: 469.50 euros [95%CI 135.80-803.19 euros]). This increase in costs was primarily due to the costs of acupuncture. The overall ICER was 17,845 euros per QALY gained. The degree of cost-effectiveness was influenced by gender, with female patients achieving a better cost-effectiveness ratio than men. In conclusion, acupuncture was a cost-effective treatment strategy in patients with chronic osteoarthritis pain.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes
#10424,Cost-effectiveness of acupuncture in women and men with allergic rhinitis: a randomized controlled study in usual care,"To assess quality of life and cost-effectiveness of additional acupuncture treatment for allergic rhinitis, patients were randomly allocated to 2 groups; both received usual care, but one group received an additional 10 acupuncture sessions. Quality of life (according to the SF-36 Health Survey), and direct and indirect costs, were assessed at baseline and after 3 months, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of acupuncture treatment was calculated. This German study (December 2000-June 2004) involved 981 patients (64% women, mean age 40.9 years (standard deviation, 11.2); 36% men, mean age 43.2 years (standard deviation, 13.0)). At 3 months, quality of life was higher in the acupuncture group than in the control group (mean Physical Component Score 51.99 (standard error (SE), 0.33) vs. 48.25 (SE, 0.33), P < 0.001; mean Mental Component Score 48.55 (SE, 0.42) vs. 45.35 (SE, 0.42), respectively, P < 0.001).

#10447,Efficacy of Manipulative Acupuncture Therapy Monitored by LSCI Technology in Patients with Severe Bell's Palsy: A Randomized Controlled Trial,"To determine if the effect of manipulative acupuncture monitored by laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI) can improve facial blood perfusion in patients with severe Bell's palsy. This randomized, single-blind, controlled trial included 120 newly diagnosed patients (within 14 days) with severe Bell's palsy (House-Brackmann grading system (HBGS) ≥ grade IV). The patients were randomized (1 : 1) to receive either acupoints acupuncture combined with manipulations of twirling, lifting, and thrusting treatments (manipulative acupuncture) or acupoints acupuncture therapy alone (simple acupuncture). These treatments consisted of a total of 24 sessions, three times per week, and each treatment lasted for 30 min. Following 8 weeks of treatment and 6 months after the initial onset of facial palsy, facial nerve functioning was scored (HBGS) and clinical efficacy was measured. The patients' facial blood perfusion significantly improved following manipulative acupuncture assisted by LSCI compared with that at baseline (P < 0.01). At the conclusion of the 8-week treatment, both groups showed improvement; however, the recovery rate was significantly different (manipulative acupuncture 53.3% vs. simple acupuncture 33.9%, P < 0.05). Follow-up analysis at 6 months after the onset of facial palsy revealed a significantly higher recovery rate (91.7% vs. 78.0%; P < 0.05). In addition, the number of treatments in the observation group was less than that in the simple acupuncture therapy group (P < 0.05). Compared with simple acupuncture therapy, manipulative acupuncture therapy led to a more significant recovery rate in the treatment of severe Bell's palsy and required a shorter course of treatment.

#10500,Effect of laser acupuncture on disuse osteoarthritis: an ultrasound biomicroscopic study of patellar articular cartilage in rats,"To investigate the effect of laser acupuncture (LA) on disuse changes in articular cartilage using ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM), Eighteen rats were randomly divided into the control group (C), the tail-suspended group (T), and the tail-suspended with LA treatment group (L). During 28-day suspension period, group L were treated with LA at acupoints on the left hindlimb while group T had a sham treatment. Ultrasound roughness index (URI), integrated reflection coefficient (IRC), integrated backscatter coefficient (IBC), cartilage thickness, and ultrasonographic score (US) of articular cartilage at patella were measured by using an ultrasound biomicroscopy system (UBS). Compared with the group C, URI significantly (P < 0.01) increased by 60.9% in group T, increased by 38.1% in group L. In addition, unloading induced a significant cartilage thinning (P < 0.05) in group T, whereas cartilage thickness in group L was 140.22 ± 19.61 μm reaching the level of the control group (147.00 ± 23.99 μm). There was no significant difference in IRC, IBC, and US among the three groups. LA therapy could help to retain the quality of articular cartilage which was subjected to unloading. LA would be a simple and safe nonpharmacological countermeasure for unloading-induced osteoarthritis.

#10521,Average paraxial power of a lens and visual acuity,"To provide a solution for average paraxial lens power (A(p)P) of a lens. Orthogonal and oblique sections through a lens of power [Formula: see text] were reduced to a paraxial representation of lens power followed by integration. Visual acuity was measured using lenses of different powers (cylinders of - 1.0 and - 2.0D) and axes, mean spherical equivalent (MSE) of S + C/2, A(p)P and a toric correction, with the order of correction randomised. A digital screen at 6 m was used on which a Landolt C with crowding bars was displayed for 0.3 s before vanishing. The general equation for a symmetrical lens of refractive index (n), radius of curvature R, in medium of refractive index n1, through orthogonal ([Formula: see text]) and oblique meridians ([Formula: see text]) as a function of the angle of incidence ([Formula: see text]) reduces for paraxial rays ([Formula: see text]) to [Formula: see text].

#10536,[Mining analysis and experience summary for chronic atrophic gastritis cases treated by Professor LIU Feng-bin],"To summarize Professor LIU Feng-bin's clinical experience and theoretical thoughts on chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG), the study group designed a retrospective study on his case series and expert interview. First of all, the data of CAG patients treated in the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine between 2009 and 2013, e. g. herbs, diseases, syndrome type, prescription amount and number of herbs, was collected and processed. The statistical description and binary logistic regression were used to determined the syndrome type, initial basic remedy and modification. During the statistics, a complete and sub-group analysis was performed simultaneously. After the expert interview, the syndrome type and medication were finalized. As a result, a total of 228 CAG patients aged at (50.30 ± 10.18) were collected, including 151 males (66.23%). Of them, the TCM diagnosis and syndrome type were extracted from the information of 157 patients, including 115 cases with gastric stuffiness, 23 cases with gastric pain, 19 missing cases, 2 cases with spleen-stomach weakness syndrome, 57 cases with spleen deficiency and dampness-heat syndrome, 18 cases with spleen-stomach disharmony syndrome, 23 cases with syndrome of liver depression syndrome, 21 cases with liver qi invading stomach syndrome and 26 qi and yin deficiency syndrome, respectively. All of the 228 patients used totally 104 herbs, while the subgroups with 157 patients used 94 herbs. The most frequently used 15 herbs used in each groups were analyzed to determine the initial basic remedy and modification. Subsequently, based on the information of the sub-groups with 157 patients, with the syndrome type as the dependent variable, the logistic regression analysis was made on the most frequently used 32 herbs, in order to determined the modification in herbs for different syndrome types. After experts reviewed and modified, they believed the main causes of CAG were dietary irregularities, moodiness and weak constitution; the pathogenesis of CAG was spleen deficiency with qi stagnation, heat depression and blood stasis in the stomach meridian. The above six syndrome types and 12 herbs were determined, including Pseudostellariae Radix, Poria, Atractylodismacrocephalae Rhizoma, Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma, Fritillariae Thunbergii Bulbus, Sepiae Endoconcha, Arecae Pericarpium, Aurantii Fructus, Perillae Caulis, Herba Hedyotis Diffusae, Scutellariae Barbatae Herba, Curcumae Rhizoma.

#10557,"Acupuncture at SP6 Point in Lower Extremities Improved Patients' Insomnia, Which Was Also Shown Through Ryodoraku Electrical Measurements","Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) applies acupuncture to treat insomnia and the SP6 is known to be beneficial for sleep. This study aimed to investigate the effects of acupuncture at SP6 on resting electroencephalogram (EEG), meridian electrical activity (Ryodoraku), and stress in patients with confirmed insomnia. In this single-blind, randomized clinical trial subjects (N=70) from TCM treated outpatients were randomized to receive TCM based acupuncture with manual stimulation (experimental) or sham stimulation (control) treatment. Acupuncture was applied to SP6 for 20 minutes on the spleen meridian of the foot in experimental subjects and controls received sham intervention. Significant changes between pre- and post-intervention were found in all electrical conductance values for the 12 meridians (Ryodoraku scores) in either control or experimental groups (fold change from 1.15 to 2.03) (P values <0.00 1). Eight meridians showed significantly different changes in Ryodoraku scores between pre- and post-intervention in the experimental group compared to the control group (fold change from 1.16 to 1.36) (P<0.05). EEG wave signals did not change with intervention in either group (P values ≥0.209). In summary, acupuncture at the SP6 acupoint altered meridian electrical activity of the lung periecardium, har, small intestine, sanjiao, spleen, bladder, and stomach meridians (P values <0.05) in patients with insomnia.

#10563,Electrodermal Screening of Asthmatics with AcuGraph 4,"Traditional Chinese Medicine holds that acupuncture meridian activity is correlated with quality of function of specific organs. This study sets out to determine acupuncture meridian characteristics of subjects with moderate asthma distinguishing them from healthy subjects. Fifty asthma patients (age 35.36 ± 8.68 years) and fifty similarly aged (34.11 ± 7.29 years) healthy volunteers were enrolled in the study. Electrodermal conductances at Jing Well points were measured with Acugraph 4 and also Peak Expiratory Flow Rate (PEFR) for the asthma group. All mean meridian conductances were lower for the asthma group, significance differences were in Lung and right Bladder meridians. In contrast, all but two of the standard deviations of group meridian conductances for the Asthma group were higher than those for the Healthy group. Difference in mean PEFR values between Asthma and Healthy groups was significant. These suggest that group measures of electrical conductance at Jing Well points can distinguish asthma from healthy individuals.

#10567,"Transcutaneous Electrical Acupoint Stimulation for Improving Postoperative Recovery, Reducing Stress and Inflammatory Responses in Elderly Patient Undergoing Knee Surgery","Transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation (TEAS) is a form of acupuncture treatment that applies electrical stimulation on specific acupoint through cutaneous electrodes. This technique has been used for perioperative anesthesia management as part of after surgery recovery. However, to date, limited data are available for using the TEAS for postoperative recovery in elderly surgical patients. We conducted this prospective randomized sham-control trail to evaluate the efficacy of TEAS in a group of elderly patients receiving knee surgery under epidural anesthesia. 52 subjects were assigned to either the experimental group (Group E) or control group (Group C). The patients in Group E received TEAS at zusanli (ST36), sanyinjiao (SP6), neiguan (PC6), and quchi acupoints (LI11) 30 min prior to the epidural anesthesia and postoperative day 1 and 2, while patients in Group C received sham TEAS on the same acupoints for 30 min same as those of Group E. The primary endpoint was the Quality of Recovery-40 questionnaire (QR-40) and the secondary endpoints were the biomarkers level of stress and inflammatory responses and visual analogue scale (VAS). A one-way ANOVA (SNK method) was used in statistic, and p < 0.05 is considered to be statistically significant. Our data showed that the QoR-40 was significantly lower in Group C than that in Group E at postoperative day 1 (p < 0.05); Similarly, Cortisol (COR), Adrenocorticotropic Hormone (ACTH), and C-reactive protein (CRP) were significantly lower in Group E than those of Group C at postoperative day 1, 3, and 7 (p < 0.05), while the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (N/L) was lower in Group E than that in Group C at postoperative day 1 and 3 (p < 0.05). Our results showed that perioperative TEAS administration is able to facilitate the development of postoperative recovery of elderly patients, especially at the early stage after surgery.

#10578,Transient visual field defects induced by transcranial magnetic stimulation over human occipital pole,"Transient visual field defects (VFDs) and phosphenes were induced in normal volunteers by means of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) using a circular magnetic coil of 12.5 cm diameter placed with its lower rim 2-4 cm above the inion in the midline. Subjects had to detect small, bright dots presented randomly for 14 ms in one of 60 locations on a computer screen resulting in a plot of the central 9 degrees of the visual field. In 8 of 17 subjects, transient VFDs were inducible at peak magnetic field strenghts of 1.1-1.4 T. In the central 1-3 degrees, detection of targets was impaired in both the upper and lower visual field, whereas at 4-9 degrees large parts of only the lower visual field were affected with a sharp cut-off along the horizontal meridian. Targets at 1 degree in the lower field were affected with lower TMS intensities than corresponding locations in the upper or peripheral locations in the lower field. Detection of central targets was affected at more caudal stimulation sites than detection of peripheral targets. Phosphenes were elicitable in 14 of 17 subjects at clearly lower field strengths of 0.6-1.0 T. Many subjects perceived chromatophosphenes. From a discussion of the literature on patients with VFDs and the known topography of the human visual system, it is concluded that the transient VFDs at 1-3 degrees are probably due to stimulation of both striate cortex (V1) and extrastriate areas (V2/V3), while VFDs in the lower visual field at eccentricities 4-9 degrees are due to stimulation of V2/V3 but not V1.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No

#10647,Presaccadic Attention Shifts Up- and Downwards: Evidence From the Pupil Light Response,"Vision is introspectively stable, yet every eye movement moves the image of the world on the retina. The dominant view states that attention must precede saccades to prepare the brain for the postsaccadic retinal input, which ensures a stable visual experience. A recent surge of studies investigated visual asymmetries around the visual field, including asymmetries in presaccadic attention. Such studies demonstrated benefits of presaccadic attention on task performance for horizontal and downward saccades, but strikingly no such benefit was observed for upward saccades. An absence of upward presaccadic shifts would contrast the dominant view and indicate that presaccadic attention may not be necessary to ensure perceptual continuity. Here, we capitalized on the fact that the pupil light response robustly tracks spatial attention to investigate whether presaccadic attention shifts up- and downwards. We manipulated whether the landing brightness of the ensuing saccade could be prepared for prior to the saccade. Specifically, we either presented brightness patches throughout the trial or only presented these upon saccade onset. In two experiments, we observed earlier pupil light responses for both up- and downward saccades when the landing brightness could be prepared for presaccadically. This shows that presaccadic attention shifted prior to up- and downward saccades and agrees with presaccadic attention being instrumental in realizing a stable visual experience. Reconciling previously contradictory findings, presaccadic attention can be shifted without necessarily yielding perceptual benefits for all facets of visual processing at the attended location. Nevertheless, our findings demonstrate presaccadic attention to shift along the vertical meridian.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
#10696,Inhibitory effect of electroacupuncture (EA) on the pressor response induced by exercise stress,"We examined the effect of EA on the exercise stress-induced pressor response in healthy adult subjects of both sexes. Each subject was subjected to a bicycle exercise test using a ramp protocol once/week for three or four weeks. Subjects were asked to perform the following tests in random order: 1) a baseline exercise test without EA and 2) exercise after acupuncture at P 5-6, LI 4-L 7 and/or G 37-39 acupoints. Brachial systolic (SBP), diastolic (DBP), and mean blood pressures (MBP), heart rate (HR) and the rate-pressure product (RPP, systolic BP x HR/100) were measured every three min, while a 12 lead ECG was monitored continuously. We observed increases in MBP, SBP, HR and RPP in all 17 subjects during exercise. In 12 of the 17 subjects (71 %), EA for 30 min before exercise, either at Jianshi-Neiguan acupoints (P 5-6) or Hegu-Lique acupoints (LI 4-L 7), led to an increase in maximal workload, and reduced peak SBP, MBP and RPP responses to exercise; EA did not alter DBP or HR responses in these subjects. EA at control acupoints (Guangming-Xuanzhong acupoints, G 37-39) in five subjects did not alter the hemodynamic responses. Seven additional subjects were enrolled to study the effect of EA during a bicycle exercise test using a constant workload. The results were similar, in five of the seven subjects SBP, MBP and RPP after exercise were attenuated significantly by EA at P 5-6.

#10720,Manual interception of moving targets. I. Performance and movement initiation,"We investigated the capacities of human subjects to intercept moving targets in a two-dimensional (2D) space. Subjects were instructed to intercept moving targets on a computer screen using a cursor controlled by an articulated 2D manipulandum. A target was presented in 1 of 18 combinations of three acceleration types (constant acceleration, constant deceleration, and constant velocity) and six target motion times, from 0.5 to 2.0 s. First, subjects held the cursor in a start zone located at the bottom of the screen along the vertical meridian. After a pseudorandom hold period, the target appeared in the lower left or right corner of the screen and traveled at 45 degrees toward an interception zone located on the vertical meridian 12.5 cm above the start zone. For a trial to be considered successful, the subject's cursor had to enter the interception zone within 100 ms of the target's arrival at the center of the interception zone and stay inside a slightly larger hold zone. Trials in which the cursor arrived more than 100 ms before the target were classified as ""early errors,"" whereas trials in which the cursor arrived more than 100 ms after the target were classified as ""late errors."" Given the criteria above, the task proved to be difficult for the subjects. Only 41.3% (1080 out of 2614) of the movements were successful, whereas the remaining 58.7% were temporal (i.e., early or late) errors. A large majority of the early errors occurred in trials with decelerating targets, and their percentage tended to increase with longer target motion times. In contrast, late errors occurred in relation to all three target acceleration types, and their percentage tended to decrease with longer target motion times. Three models of movement initiation were investigated. First, the threshold-distance model, originally proposed for optokinetic eye movements to constant-velocity visual stimuli, maintains that response time is composed of two parts, a constant processing time and the time required for the stimulus to travel a threshold distance. This model only partially fit our data. Second, the threshold-tau model, originally proposed as a strategy for movement initiation, assumes that the subject uses the first-order estimate of time-to-contact (tau) to determine when to initiate the interception movement. Similar to the threshold distance model, the threshold-tau model only partially fit the data. Finally, a dual-strategy model was developed which allowed for the adoption of either of the two strategies for movement initiation; namely, a strategy based on the threshold-distance model (""reactive"" strategy) and another based on the threshold-tau model (""predictive"" strategy). This model provided a good fit to the data. In fact, individual subjects preferred to use one or the other strategy. This preference was allowed to be manifested at long target motion times, whereas shorter target motion times (i.e., 0.5 s and 0.8 s) forced the subjects to use only the reactive strategy.",No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
