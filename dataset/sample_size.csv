#31,"Can Acupuncture Improve the Flexibility of Hamstring Muscles? A Randomized, Blinded, and Controlled Pilot Study","(1) Background: The lack of flexibility is frequently reported as a risk factor for hamstring muscle damage. Acupuncture, a therapeutic tool of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), may play a role in both treatment and prevention by improving muscle strength, microcirculation, and reducing muscle soreness. The primary objective of this pilot study was to examine the immediate effects of acupuncture on hamstring muscle stretching and on the pain or discomfort reported during stretching. (2) Methods: To mitigate heterogeneity effects, and due to the small sample size, the study employed a crossover design in which each participant was tested at three different moments of the experimental period with verum (true acupuncture in selected acupoints), sham (fake acupuncture in zones of the skin not corresponding to any known acupoint but near the selected acupoints), and placebo (stimulation of the selected acupoints with a stainless steel wire and cannula, without puncturing) stimulations. Flexibility and pain or discomfort were assessed using the seat and reach test (SR) and a visual analogic scale (VAS). (3) Results: Significant changes in flexibility were observed after verum acupuncture (p = 0.03), while no significant changes were seen in sham and placebo (p = 0.86 and p = 0.18, respectively). No significant differences were found in pain or discomfort during any of the stimulations (verum, p = 0.55; sham, p = 0.50; placebo, p = 0.58). (4) Conclusions: The results of this pilot study suggest that acupuncture may improve flexibility in the hamstring muscles, though it does not significantly affect pain or discomfort during stretching."
#41,Electrocortical Analysis of Patients with Intercostobrachial Pain Treated with TENS after Breast Cancer Surgery,"[Purpose] Among the physical therapeutic procedures to decrease pain, there is transcutaneous electrical neural stimulation (TENS). There is no consensus about its efficacy for oncological patients, especially for post-mastectomy pain and eletrocortical changes in somatosensory areas. The aim of this study was to analyze acute electrocortical changes after TENS treatment of patients with intercostobrachial post mastectomy pain. [Subjects] Eighteen patients were divided into acupuncture (A) and burst (B) group. [Methods] In this pre and post-intervention study each group was measured for EEG analysis in absulte power in alpha band (8-14 Hz). Outcomes variables were the alpha waveband in the sensorymotor cortex and pain pre-and-post TENS intervention. Data were analyzed using ANOVA to compare times (rest, 10 and 15 min), group and electrodes. Pain was analyzed using percentual pain evaluation (PPE) in both groups. [Results] Outcomes indicate main effects of time and electrodes because of slow (8-10 Hz) and fast alpha (10-12 Hz) wavebands decreased. PPE reduced 88.4% in A and 66.3% in G. [Conclusion] TENS promoted electrical modification in the parietal region and a decrease in pain. Future studies should investigate other wave must be proposed for other bands and use different methods of EEG analysis to elucidate the actual mechanisms behind the efficacy of TENS treatment."
#151,Superficial acupuncture in the relief of chronic low back pain,"A single-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial of superficial acupuncture in the treatment of low back pain was carried out by comparing 8 patients treated by acupuncture with 9 patients treated by placebo. In all five measures of efficacy chosen for study the acupuncture group achieved better responses than the placebo group; four of the five inter-group differences were statistically significant. In addition, an overall mean for all five measures combined showed significant superiority of acupuncture over placebo."
#185,[Application of expertise-based pragmatic randomized controlled trial in acupuncture-moxibustion clinical research],"According to clinical practice, the characteristics and issues of pragmatic randomized controlled trial(PRCT) and expertise-based randomized controlled trial (EBRCT) in acupuncture-moxibustion clinical research were summarized. The characteristics of expertise-based pragmatic randomized controlled trial (EB-PRCT), which is the combination of above two, and its application in acupuncture-moxibustion clinical trial were explored. PRCT emphasizes the clinical practice, the positive control of standard therapy and the the blind performance on data collection and statistics. PRCT has the advantage of flexible grouping, nevertheless, it also has shortcomings such as higher cost and lack of typical subjects. EBRCT emphasizes the participation of professional acupuncturists, so that the therapeutic effect is ensured, the compliance of subjects and the bias of manipulation are improved. Thus, the replacement scheme of acupuncturists is essential in EBRCT. Having the complementary advantages, EB-PRCT provides a superior research method for acupuncture-moxibustion clinical trial, and leads to convincing results."
#195,Assessment of Acupoint Therapy of Traditional Chinese Medicine on Cough Variant Asthma: A Meta-analysis,"Acupoint application has been used in China to treat various illnesses for ages. In cough variant asthma (CVA), the main clinical sign is episodic night cough. Acupoint application therapy of traditional Chinese medicine is an effective procedure to treat cough variant asthma. The current study is designed to systematically assess the effectiveness of acupoint application therapy in traditional medicine for patients with cough variant asthma. The comprehensive computer retrieval related to comparison between acupoint application and nonacupoint application therapy for cough variant asthma was carried out in various databases (n = 8) from database establishment until July 4, 2021. Both English and Chinese articles about original investigations in humans were searched. Two independent authors extracted the data, and disagreements were resolved by discussion. ReviewManager 5.3 software provided by Cochrane did a meta-analysis of selected randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Quality of experimentation and risk bias were analyzed by the Cochrane Handbook tool. A total of thirteen randomized controlled clinical articles along with 1237 patients were included in the study. Findings of meta-analysis showed that compared with nonacupoint application treatment, the total effective rate of acupoint application treatment is more effective (RD = 0.13, 95% CI (0.09, 0.17), Z = 6.70, P < 0.00001). Besides, acupoint application can improve patients' lung function, the lung function index FVC (mean difference = 0.55, 95% confidence interval (0.42, 0.68), Z = 8.40, P < 0.00001), FEV1 (MD = 0.35, 95% CI (0.23, 0.47), Z = 5.86, P < 0.00001), FEV1/FVC (%) (MD = 12.68, 95% CI (4.32, 21.03), Z = 2.97, P = 0.003), FEV1 (%) (MD = 8.63, 95% CI (8.01, 9.25), Z = 27.44, P < 0.00001), and PEF (day) (MD = 0.62, 95% CI (0.52, 0.71), Z = 12.40, P < 0.00001) of patients treated by acupoint application therapy were increased. Moreover, acupoint application might lower the level of immunoglobulin E (MD = -54.58, 95% CI (-63.54, -45.61), Z = 11.93, P < 0.00001) and EOS (MD = -0.21, 95% CI (-0.35, -0.06), Z = 2.77, P = 0.006). The LCQ (Leicester cough questionnaire) total score of CVA patients was also increased (MD = 2.30, 95% CI (1.55, 3.06), Z = 5.98, P < 0.00001). Acupoint application therapy is effective in controlling symptoms of CVA. It also has a positive effect in improving lung function and life quality of patients. It can reduce the eosinophil levels and peripheral blood IgE levels of patients as well."
#217,Acupuncture,"Acupuncture and acupressure at traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) sites used to treat low milk supply has been claimed to cause release of prolactin and oxytocin, although published studies have found mixed results on serum prolactin. A meta-analysis found that acupressure improved milk production and increased serum prolactin, but the quality and consistency of the studies was variable.[1] No serious adverse effects on milk production were seen among lactating women who received acupuncture or acupressure for postpartum sciatica.[1,2] Acupuncture has been well described in TCM for treating insufficient milk supply,[3,4] and has also been used in some Western countries.[5-7] Numerous studies found acupuncture at CV 17 (also referred to as Ren 17, Danzhong or Shanzong; located at the center of the sternum), SI 1 (Shaoze; on the little finger), ST 18 (Rugen; lower breast margins), Zusanli (ST 36), and Taichong (LR 3) to benefit women with a low postpartum milk supply.[8] These studies generally do not meet current evidence-based guidelines, partly because of the extreme difficulty in double-blinding and placebo-controlling acupuncture studies. However, 2 studies did find a better response to electroacupuncture applied at a traditional site for lactation stimulation (SI 1) than electroacupuncture applied at a site unrelated to milk production (LI 1). Electroacupuncture increased serum prolactin, infant weight and maternal perception of milk production more than domperidone alone.[9] None of the studies reported to date have made an attempt to optimize maternal nursing technique before acupuncture. Although less studied, acupressure at milk acupuncture sites has had similar effects.[10] Systematic reviews concluded that acupuncture and acupressure are effective in increasing serum prolactin and breastmilk volume, although study quality is critically low.[10-14] Acupressure combined with back massage increases serum prolactin and milk production more than either alone in one study.[15] The combination of acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicines appeared to be more effective in increasing lactation parameters than acupuncture alone.[14] Acupuncture therapy has been used to treat breastfeeding for milk stasis (engorgement). Randomized, nonblinded studies in an outpatient Swedish lactation clinic compared routine care (including oxytocin spray) to routine care plus acupuncture at 2 or 3 points for treating milk stasis.[16,17] A meta-analysis concluded that women who received acupuncture were less likely to develop an abscess, had less severe symptoms on day five, and had a lower rate of fever than women in the usual care group However, there is insufficient evidence from published trials to justify widespread implementation.[18] A survey of 50 Swedish maternity units in 2007 found that 60% of hospitals used acupuncture to treat milk stasis, 18% used acupuncture to treat mastitis, and 2.2% each used it for painful breastfeeding or to improve milk supply. The authors felt that this extensive use was not justified based on the limited evidence for most of these uses.[19] Acupuncture and acupressure have also been used successfully as a treatment for breast engorgement and pain.[11,20] Auricular therapy uses stimulation of acupoints on the ear corresponding to various anatomical sites and functions of the body for the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of disease. All studies applied Vaccaria seeds to press on ear acupoints. Two systematic reviews on auricular therapy to increase milk supply have come to differing conclusions. One review found a positive effect on milk production, onset of lactation, serum prolactin, breast fullness, neonate states, and frequency of newborn urination and defecation.[21] A more recent review found varying efficacy between studies and poor methodology that did not allow for a definitive conclusion on efficacy as a galactogogue.[22] No adverse effects were reported in any studies. A newer additional small study found similar results.[23] A controlled study found that auricular acupressure may slightly increase the pain threshold some areas of the breast in nursing mothers.[24] A single-blind study found auriculotherapy to increase breastfeeding self-efficacy in the mothers of preterm infants and to increase infant weight gain at hospital discharge.[25]"
#279,Non-pharmacological approach to migraine prophylaxis: part II,"Acupuncture has been used to both prevent and treat diseases for over 3,000 years. Recently, a Cochrane review on its use in migraine concluded that acupuncture is effective and should be considered as a prophylactic measure for patients with frequent or insufficiently controlled migraine attacks. In contrast, there is no clear evidence to support or refute the use of homeopathy in the management of migraine. Among vitamins and other supplements, riboflavin and coenzyme Q10 significantly decreased the frequency of migraine attacks. Alpha lipoic acid also reduced migraine frequency, albeit not significantly as compared to placebo. The prophylactic efficacy of magnesium, particularly for children and menstrually related migraine, has recently been substantiated. Among the herbal remedies, butterbur significantly decreases attack frequency, whereas the efficacy of feverfew was not confirmed in a Cochrane review, probably because of the 400% variations in the dosage of its active principle. Finally, ginkgolide B has proved significantly effective in controlling migraine with aura and pediatric migraine in uncontrolled studies that need a confirmation."
#294,"Pain Relief during Oocyte Retrieval by Transcutaneous Electrical Acupoint Stimulation: A Single-Blinded, Randomized, Controlled Multicenter Trial","Acupuncture has pain-relief effects, but no data were available on the use of transcutaneous electric acupoint stimulation (TEAS) in pain relief during oocyte retrieval. This study was designed to examine the effect of TEAS for pain relief in women undergoing transvaginal ultrasound-guided oocyte aspiration. This single-blinded, multicenter, randomized controlled trial was performed in China between May 2013 and May 2015. The subjects were randomized to mock TEAS and TEAS. TEAS or mock TEAS was administered 30 min before oocyte retrieval until the end of the operation. The primary and secondary endpoints were the pain measured using the visual analog scale (VAS) within 1 min and 1 hour after oocyte retrieval, respectively. Serum β-endorphin levels were tested in the first 50 patients/group. 390 women were undergoing oocyte retrieval. Pain levels evaluated using VAS within 1 min (18.6 ± 1.3 vs. 24.4 ± 1.7, P < 0.01) and 1 h after oocyte aspiration (4.6 ± 0.7 vs. 6.8 ± 0.8, P < 0.05) were lower in the TEAS group than in the mock TEAS group. Nausea assessment revealed a significantly lower VAS score in the TEAS group within 1 min (1.2 ± 0.4 vs. 2.9 ± 0.7, P < 0.033). Serum β-endorphin levels were significantly higher in the TEAS group than in the mock TEAS group (11.4 ± 0.5 vs. 9.1 ± 0.4, P < 0.001) after retrieval. Serum β-endorphin levels were higher in the TEAS group after the procedure than baseline (11.4 ± 0.5 vs. 9.1 ± 0.3, P < 0.001). Oocyte retrieval causes pain and discomfort, but TEAS is effective and safe for suppressing the pain and alleviating nausea associated with the operation."
#386,A randomized controlled trial of acupuncture and moxibustion to treat Bell's palsy according to different stages: design and protocol,"Acupuncture to treat Bell's palsy is one of the most commonly used methods in China. There are a variety of acupuncture treatment options to treat Bell's palsy in clinical practice. Since Bell's palsy has three different path-stages (acute stage, resting stage and restoration stage), so whether acupuncture is effective in the different path-stages and which acupuncture treatment is the best method are major issues in acupuncture clinical trials about Bell's palsy. In this article, we report the design and protocol of a large sample multi-center randomized controlled trial to treat Bell's palsy with acupuncture. There are five acupuncture groups, with four according to different path-stages and one not. In total, 900 patients with Bell's palsy are enrolled in this study. These patients are randomly assigned to receive one of the following four treatment groups according to different path-stages, i.e. 1) staging acupuncture group, 2) staging acupuncture and moxibustion group, 3) staging electro-acupuncture group, 4) staging acupuncture along yangming musculature group or non-staging acupuncture control group. The outcome measurements in this trial are the effect comparison achieved among these five groups in terms of House-Brackmann scale (Global Score and Regional Score), Facial Disability Index scale, Classification scale of Facial Paralysis, and WHOQOL-BREF scale before randomization (baseline phase) and after randomization. The result of this trial will certify the efficacy of using staging acupuncture and moxibustion to treat Bell's palsy, and to approach a best acupuncture treatment among these five different methods for treating Bell's palsy."
#413,Acupuncture in the oncology setting: clinical trial update,"Acupuncture, the insertion of sterile needles into acupuncture points of traditional meridians on the body, is a common and effective treatment for a number of supportive care issues in oncology including acute chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. In the Integrative Oncology setting, acupuncture and Traditional Oriental Medicine have become more visible and many oncology clinics, academic health centers and comprehensive cancer centers recommend and administer acupuncture treatment. Continued basic studies on the physiologic mechanisms of acupuncture and recent clinical trials of acupuncture for cancer patients are enhancing our knowledge and informing our guidelines. While debates on methodological problems confronting the study of acupuncture remain, the most recent research demonstrates that acupuncture is safe, tolerable and effective for a range of side effects resulting from conventional cancer treatments."
#473,Acupuncture conversion of fetal breech presentation,"AIM: The aim of this study was to assess the value of acupuncture (AP) in the conversion of fetal breech presentation into vertex presentation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A randomized prospective controlled clinical study included 67 pregnant women with fetal breech presentation: 34 women with singleton pregnancies treated with manual AP (urinary bladder 67, Zhiyin) and a control group which included 33 women with singleton pregnancies without AP treatment. The AP treatment lasted 30 min a day, and was conducted during and after 34 weeks of pregnancy with simultaneous cardiotocography. RESULTS: The success rate of the AP correction of fetal breech presentation is 76.4% (26 women), and spontaneous conversion without AP in vertex presentation is observed in 15 women (45.4%; p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: We believe that AP correction of fetal malpresentation is a relatively simple, efficacious and inexpensive method associated with a lower percentage of operatively completed deliveries, which definitely reflects in improved parameters of vital and perinatal statistics."
#539,A self-made disposable iris retractor in small pupil phacoemulsification,"AIM: To explore a simple and low-cost self-made disposable flexible iris retractor and study its clinical efficacy and safety in small pupil phacoemulsification. METHODS: Polyproplyene suture and scalp acupuncture were used to make iris retractor. A prospective study were carried on 50 patients (50 eyes) with a maximally dilated pupil size of 2.5-4.0 mm which underwent phacoemulsification using this self-made iris retractor. Another 50 cases of phacoemulsification with normal pupil size sever as control group. The mean operation time, ultrasound time and ultrasonic power, volume of irrigation fluid were documented intraoperatively. The visual acuity, pupil size and complication were observed on 1d, 1wk, 1mo and 1y after operation. Corneal endothelial cell was measured at 1mo postoperatively. RESULT: Pupils could be expanded to approximately 4.5-5.5 mm with our self-made iris retractor in operation. No serious postoperative complication was found. Most (88%) of the pupils returned round or oval shape, light reflex restored to varying degrees at the first day after surgery. Best corrected visual acuity stabilized in 37 eyes (74%) at one day, in 43 eyes (86%) at one week, in 44 eyes (88%) at one month and 46 eyes (92%) at one year. Compared with the control, more time was needed to complete the operation in the small pupil group. There was no significant difference of the mean ultrasound time, ultrasonic power, volume of irrigation fluid required and corneal endothelial cell loss in 1mo follow up between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Our self-made disposable flexible iris retractor could be easy obtained preoperatively or intraoperatively. It performed both safety and efficacy in our clinical trials. This simple self-made device has shown economic and practical values, especially in primary care hospital of the less developed districts."
#555,Correlation between corneal biomechanical and tomographic parameters in cataract patients,"AIM: To investigate the relationship between preoperative corneal biomechanical properties and corneal tomographic properties in cataract patients. METHODS: The study consisted of 59 eyes of 30 participants who were diagnosed as cataract in Peking University Third Hospital between September 2019 and November 2019. Stepwise multivariable linear regression analysis was calculated to determine the relationship between corneal biomechanical parameters and tomographic parameters. The patients were classified into three groups of with the rule (WTR) astigmatism, against the rule astigmatism and oblique astigmatism. And the differences in corneal parameters among different groups were compared. RESULTS: There were significant differences in the first applanation time (A1T), the first applanation length (A1L), corneal velocity during the first applanation (Vin), the second applanation time (A2T), highest concavity (HC) radius, displacement amount (DA), DA ratio, stiffness parameter A1 (SPA1) and integrated radius (IR) between oblique astigmatism patients and the other two groups. Total corneal steep meridian (K2) was negatively associated with A1L, A1T and corneal velocity during the second applanation (Vout). Patients with higher anterior corneal curvature had lower HC radius and central corneal thickness (CCT; P=0.001 and 0.006, respectively), while the Ambrosio relational thickness to the horizontal profile (ARTh) was higher than those with lower anterior corneal curvature (P=0.009). CONCLUSION: The study reveals that the elasticity of corneal collagen fibers is greater, but the viscoelasticity of cornea is smaller in patients with oblique astigmatism. There is no significant difference in ARTh between patients with different types of astigmatism, that is, the corneal biomechanical specificity of oblique astigmatism group is probably not caused by corneal thickness. Moreover, we find patients with higher anterior corneal curvature has lower HC radius and CCT but higher ARTh than those with lower anterior corneal curvature."
#564,"Transcutaneous electrical cranial-auricular acupoint stimulation versus escitalopram for mild-to-moderate depression: An assessor-blinded, randomized, non-inferiority trial","AIM: Transcutaneous electrical cranial-auricular acupoint stimulation (TECAS) is a novel non-invasive therapy that stimulates acupoints innervated by the trigeminal and auricular vagus nerves. An assessor-blinded, randomized, non-inferiority trial was designed to compare the efficacy of TECAS and escitalopram in mild-to-moderate major depressive disorder. METHODS: 468 participants received two TECAS sessions per day at home (n = 233) or approximately 10-13 mg/day escitalopram (n = 235) for 8 weeks plus 4-week follow-up. The primary outcome was clinical response, defined as a baseline-to-endpoint ≥50% reduction in Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score. Secondary outcomes included remission rate, changes in the severity of depression, anxiety, sleep and life quality. RESULTS: The response rate was 66.4% on TECAS and 63.2% on escitalopram with a 3.2% difference (95% confidence interval [CI], -5.9% to 12.9%) in intention-to-treat analysis, and 68.5% versus 66.2% with a 2.3% difference (95% CI, -6.9% to 11.4%) in per-protocol analysis. The lower limit of 95% CI of the differences fell within the prespecified non-inferiority margin of -10% (P ≤ 0.004 for non-inferiority). Most secondary outcomes did not differ between the two groups. TECAS-treated participants who experienced psychological trauma displayed a markedly greater response than those without traumatic experience (81.3% vs 62.1%, P = 0.013). TECAS caused much fewer adverse events than escitalopram. CONCLUSIONS: TECAS was comparable to escitalopram in improving depression and related symptoms, with high acceptability, better safety profile, and particular efficacy in reducing trauma-associated depression. It could serve an effective portable therapy for mild-to-moderate depression."
#618,Smoke or smokeless moxibustion treatment for breech presentation: A three-arm pilot trial,"AIMS: We conducted a pilot trial to compare the effects of smoke and smokeless moxibustion with a control as a possible supplement to external cephalic version (ECV) for converting breech to cephalic presentation and increasing adherence to cephalic position, and to assess their effects on the well-being of the mother and child. METHODS: We used a quasi-experimental design with 3 arms: a smoke moxibustion (SM) (n = 20) and smokeless moxibustion (SLM) (n = 20) groups (20-min acupoint BL67 stimulation once or twice daily for 10-14 days), and a control group (n = 20). The participants had singleton breech presentations between 33 and 35 gestation weeks. The primary outcome was cephalic presentation at the conclusion of intervention. The secondary outcomes were cephalic presentation at birth and effects on mother and child well-being. RESULTS: At the conclusion of intervention, cephalic presentation was higher in the SLM (60.0%) than the control groups (25.0%), Relative Risk 2.40, 95% Confidence Interval [1.04-5.56]; there was no significant difference for SM. At birth, there were no significant differences in cephalic presentation or well-being. CONCLUSION: SLM treatment showed an increasing trend towards cephalic presentation at the conclusion of intervention. Although significant differences were not observed at birth possibly due to the small samples and non-randomization, moxibustion was safe, and not associated with perinatal morbidity and mortality. A randomized controlled trial with a larger sample is warranted to ascertain SLM treatment as a possible ECV supplement for converting and increasing adherence to cephalic position."
#682,Study of Scraping with Copper Stone Based on Theory of Midnight-Noon Ebb-Flow in Angina Pectoris with Coronary Heart Disease of Qi Stagnation and Blood Stasis,"Angina pectoris (AP) with coronary heart disease (CHD) is one of the common cardiovascular diseases in clinical practice, which can be classified as ""chest paralysis"" in Chinese medicine according to its symptoms, and it is described in many ancient documents. Ancient Chinese medicine believes that the main pathogenesis of the disease is poor blood flow leading to paralysis of the heart and veins, so it is often treated by activating blood and removing blood stasis. In this study, 120 patients with AP of CHD of Qi stagnation and blood stasis type were randomly divided into the observation (n = 60) and the control group (n = 60). In the control group, basic care, conventional treatment, and unselected copper acupuncture scraping were used, while in the observation group, copper acupuncture scraping was performed at the right time of the heart meridian (11 : 00-13 : 00) on the basis of the control group, and all patients received the treatment for a total duration of 4 weeks. We collected data on the traditional Chinese medical (TCM) syndrome score, frequency and duration of angina attacks, nitroglycerin dosage, inflammatory factor levels, and hematological indices pretreatment and posttreatment in both groups. Patients' adverse effects during treatment were recorded, and the clinical efficacy and ECG efficacy in both groups were evaluated after 4 weeks. We used SPSS.20 statistical software to statistically analyze the above data, and the results showed that the clinical efficacy and ECG efficacy of the observation group were significantly higher than the control group posttreatment. After treatment, the TCM symptom score, angina attack frequency, attack duration and nitroglycerin dosage, serum interleukin-8 (IL-8), hypersensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) levels, whole blood viscosity (WBV), plasma viscosity (PV), fibrinogen (FIB), and hematocrit (Hct) were significantly lower in both groups compared with those posttreatment. And the observation group showed a greater decrease when compared with the control group. The results also showed that the overall incidence of adverse reactions was lower in both groups during the treatment period. The above results indicate that while ensuring high safety, the copper stone based on theory of midnight-noon ebb-flow can more effectively improve the symptoms and inflammatory response of the body and reduce the viscosity of the blood in AP with CHD of Qi stagnation and blood stasis, and it has better therapeutic effects."
#686,Dietary β-Glucan Alleviates Antibiotic-Associated Side Effects by Increasing the Levels of Antioxidant Enzyme Activities and Modifying Intestinal Microbiota in Pacific White Shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei),"Antibiotics and their secondary metabolites are commonly found in aquatic ecosystems, leading to the passive exposure of many aquatic animals to low doses of antibiotics, which can affect their health. However, there is limited information available on how to mitigate the side effects of antibiotics on normal aquatic animals. This study aimed to investigate the potential of dietary β-glucan to alleviate the side effects induced by antibiotics in Pacific white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) (0.37 ± 0.02 g). A six-week feeding trial was conducted with four dietary treatments including a control, 1 g/kg β-glucan (β-glucan), 50 mg/kg oxytetracycline (OTC), and a combination of 50 mg/kg OTC and 1 g/kg β-glucan (Mix) groups. At the end of the trial, the growth performance, intestinal microbial composition, antioxidant capacity, and immune response of the shrimp were assessed. There were no significant differences in growth performance among the groups, but the condition factor of the shrimp in the Mix group was significantly decreased when compared to the control and β-glucan groups. The activities of hepatopancreas catalase (CAT) and serum phenol oxidase in the OTC group were significantly lower than those in the control group. On the other hand, the activities of hepatopancreas superoxide dismutase and CAT enzymes in the β-glucan group were significantly higher than those in the OTC group. The supplementation of β-glucan in combination with antibiotics significantly increased the CAT activity and bacteriolytic activity compared to the OTC and control groups, respectively. Moreover, an analysis of the intestinal microbiota revealed that the Observed_species estimator in the Mix group was significantly higher than that in the control group. Dietary antibiotics significantly increased the abundance of Actinobacteria at the phylum level, but the Mix group showed no significant difference. The supplementation of β-glucan in combination with antibiotics also significantly increased the relative abundance of Meridianimaribacter compared to the control group. Additionally, the synergistic influence of β-glucan with antibiotics increased the beta diversity of intestinal microbiotas. These findings suggest that the supplementation of β-glucan in combination with antibiotics on Pacific white shrimp can alleviate the low antioxidant capacity and immune response caused by antibiotics while enhancing the intestinal microbial composition. This provides a potential solution to mitigate the negative impacts of antibiotics in aquaculture."
#710,Efficacy and safety of acupuncture in the treatment of depression: A systematic review of clinical research,"As a common mental disorder, depression is one of the leading causes of disability around the world. Clinical studies have shown that acupuncture is an effective therapy without obvious side effects compared to limited efficacy and adverse reactions of drug therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, and neuromodulation technology in treating depression. The objective of this review is to systematically evaluate whether acupuncture therapies for depression are safe and effective in order to provide a high-quality reference for clinical trials of acupuncture. A systematic search of the literature was carried out through bibliographic search engine PubMed. Subsequently, the study design, intervention methods, control group, results, and safety of acupuncture were analyzed. The results showed that acupuncture as an adjunct to antidepressants or as a single treatment can exert a positive impact on patients' depressive symptoms. Compared with antidepressants, acupuncture has the advantages of fast onset and long-term efficacy in the treatment of depression, and can enhance the efficacy of antidepressants. Moreover, the efficacy and safety of acupuncture in the treatment of depression maybe related to the qualification of the acupuncturist, the selection of acupoints, and intervention measures."
#712,Improvement of Acupuncture Based on Smart Medical Care for Post-Stroke Hemiplegic Shoulder Pain and Upper Limb Motor Function,"As a new stage in the development of medicine and health, smart medicine has attracted attention from all parties in recent years. Especially, under the impetus of the Internet, due to the development of new technologies, smart medical care has made considerable progress, and it has also brought us new challenges. The concept, hypothesis, and design of intelligent medical care are analyzed, and the design objects and design principles of intelligent medical care are highlighted. In Africa, 79 patients with shoulder pain after stroke and hemiplegia in the recession period were disintegrated and divided into observation group (40 people) and control group (39 people). The observation group and the control group used two different treatment methods, acupuncture treatment and traditional western medicine treatment. Finally, the situation of the two groups is checked. From the results, the treatment effect of the control group was not as good as that of the observation group (P < 0.05). After treatment, the effects of capillary disease and patients' living conditions in the observation group were better than those in the control group (P < 0.05). It is concluded that the therapeutic effect of wisdom acupuncture treatment has a certain effect and can be used in medical treatment."
#755,Research status and prospects of acupuncture for autism spectrum disorders,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder and has a predilection for children. Its symptoms, such as lifelong social communication deficits and repetitive sensory-motor behaviors, put a huge burden on the patient's family and society. Currently, there is no cure for ASD, and some medications that can improve its symptoms are often accompanied by adverse effects. Among many complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies, acupuncture has shown promising application potential, but after years of practice, it has not been recognized as the preferred CAM therapy for ASD. Therefore, we analyzed and discussed the clinical study reports of acupuncture in the treatment of ASD in the past 15 years from the aspects of study subjects, group setting, intervention modalities, acupoint selection, outcome evaluation, and safety. The data accumulated at present are not sufficient to support the clinical effectiveness of acupuncture in ASD and to justify its use in clinical practice. They provide, however, initial evidence of possible effectiveness and encourage further investigation in order to reach firm conclusions. Based on a comprehensive analysis, we believed that following the Standards for Reporting Interventions in Clinical Trials of Acupuncture (STRICTA) and Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT), screening the optimal combination of acupoints applying a rigorous scientific study design, and performing the related functional experiments may be the effective way to convincingly test the hypothesis that acupuncture may be beneficial in ASD patients. The significance of this review is to provide a reference for researchers to carry out high-quality clinical trials of acupuncture in the treatment of ASD from the perspective of the combination of modern medicine and traditional Chinese medicine."
#985,Pancoast Tumor Presenting as Neck Pain in the Chiropractic Office: A Case Report and Literature Review,"BACKGROUND Pancoast tumors, also called superior sulcus tumors, are a rare type of cancer affecting the lung apex. These tumors can spread to the brachial plexus and spine and present with symptoms that appear to be of musculoskeletal origin. CASE REPORT A 59-year-old Asian man presented to a chiropractor in Hong Kong with a 1-month history of neck and shoulder pain and numbness that had been treated unsuccessfully with exercise, medications, and acupuncture. He had an active history of tuberculosis, which was currently treated with antibiotics, and a 50-pack-year history of smoking. Cervical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed urgently, revealing a small cervical disc herniation thought to correspond with radicular symptoms. However, as the patient did not respond to a brief trial of care, a thoracic MRI was urgently ordered, revealing a large superior sulcus tumor invading the upper to mid-thoracic spine. The patient was referred for medical care and received radiotherapy and chemotherapy with a positive outcome. A literature review identified 6 previously published cases in which a patient presented to a chiropractor with an undiagnosed Pancoast tumor. All patients had shoulder, spine, and/or upper extremity pain. CONCLUSIONS Patients with a previously undiagnosed Pancoast tumor can present to chiropractors given that these tumors may invade the brachial plexus and spine, causing shoulder, spine, and/or upper extremity pain. Chiropractors should be aware of the clinical features and risk factors of Pancoast tumors to readily identify them and refer such patients for medical care."
#986,Acute Effects of Acu-TENS on FEV1 and Blood Β-endorphin Level in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease,"Background Pharmacotherapy is the mainstay of dyspnea management in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Undesirable side effects have led to the application of alternative treatment strategies such as acupuncture. Our previous study showed that transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation over acupuncture points (Acu-TENS), a noninvasive modality, can reduce dyspnea symptoms in patients with COPD, but the underlying mechanism is unknown. Primary Study Objective This study investigated the effect of acu-TENS on forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), dyspnea, and Β-endorphin levels in patients with COPD. Design A double-blinded randomized controlled trial Setting: Hospital outpatient clinic Participants Forty-four subjects diagnosed with COPD Intervention Participants were randomly assigned to receive either acu-TENS or placebo-TENS on Dingchuan (EX-B1) for 45 minutes. Outcome Measures FEV1, forced vital capacity (FVC), dyspnea visual analogue score (DVAS), respiratory rate (RR), and blood Β-endorphin levels were measured before and after therapeutic intervention. Results Our findings showed that the increase in FEV1 was 24.2% greater in the acu-TENS group than the placebo group (P < .0001). The decrease in RR and DVAS was also more in the acu-TENS group by 14.2% (P < .0001) and 20.7% (P = .006), respectively. The postintervention increase in Β-endorphin was significantly higher in the acu-TENS than the placebo group (18.3%) (P = .027). Furthermore, the percentage reduction in RR correlated with the increase in Β-endorphin (R = -0.477, P = .033). Conclusion An improvement in FEV1 and dyspnea score at the end of Acu-TENS treatment was associated with a concurrent increase in b-endorphin level in patients with COPD."
#988,"Effect of Thunder-Fire Moxibustion on Pain, Quality of Life, and Tension of Multifidus in Patients with Primary Osteoporosis: A Randomized Controlled Trial","BACKGROUND Primary osteoporosis is a common disease among postmenopausal women and the elderly; low back pain is the most typical clinical manifestation an is the primary reason for a clinic visit, and directly affects patients' quality of life. Anti-osteoporosis medications have undesirable side effects, and many kinds of special traditional Chinese moxibustion methods have been widely used in the clinical treatment of osteoporosis low back pain. The purpose of this study was to observe whether thunder-fire moxibustion therapy, compared to calcium supplements alone, can ease osteoporosis low back pain, improve quality of life, and reduce tension of the multifidus. MATERIAL AND METHODS Sixty-three eligible patients were enrolled in the study (7 of these patients did not finish the study and are not included in analysis). Participants were randomly divided into 2 groups: a moxibustion group that received calcium carbonate D3 and thunder-fire moxibustion therapy, and a control group that received calcium carbonate D3 only. Level of pain experienced, assessed using the visual analogue scale (VAS), and quality of life (SF-36) were measured pre-treatment, at the end of 4 weeks of treatment, and at a 1-month post-treatment evaluation. Changes in values of Young's modulus of the multifidus were also collected before and after treatment. RESULTS After 4 weeks of treatment and at 1 month after treatment had ended, low back pain in both groups was reduced relative to pre-treatment levels. The moxibustion group was significantly improved at BP, GH, SF, and MH dimensions compared to pre-treatment levels. The control group improved in BP dimensions, but not to the same extent as the moxibustion group. Similarly, after treatment for 4 weeks with moxibustion, multifidus tension was significantly reduced. CONCLUSIONS Thunder-fire moxibustion is an effective method for treating low back pain due to primary osteoporosis."
#1029,Electroacupuncture at ST36 Protects ICC Networks via mSCF/Kit-ETV1 Signaling in the Stomach of Diabetic Mice,"Background. Electroacupuncture (EA) at ST36 has been used to regulate gastric motility and effectively improve gastric emptying in diabetic patients. Nevertheless, the specific mechanisms underlying the efficacy of this treatment remain unknown. The aim of this study was to assess the variations of interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) and explore the changes in mSCF/KIT-ETV1 signaling in the antrum and corpus of diabetic mice after treatment with EA. Methods. Male C57BL/6 mice were randomized into five groups: control group, diabetic group (DM), diabetic-plus-sham EA group (SEA), diabetic-plus-low-frequency EA group (LEA), and diabetic-plus-high-frequency EA group (HEA). The expression levels of Ano1, c-Kit, and ETV1 were assessed by immunofluorescence in the antrum and corpus. Western blotting and PCR methods were further used to evaluate c-Kit, mSCF, and ETV1 expression. Results. (1) c-Kit and Ano1 were obviously decreased in the DM group, but c-Kit reduced much more than Ano1. (2) The mSCF, c-Kit, and ETV1 mRNA and protein levels were obviously decreased in the DM group in both the antrum and the corpus (P < 0.01), but they were significantly elevated in the LEA and HEA groups (P < 0.01). Conclusions. Ano1 is a reliable marker to detect ICC changes in diabetes; low- and high-frequency EA at acupoint ST36 can protect the networks of ICC possibly via normal activation of mSCF/KIT-ETV1 signaling."
#1047,More Than Needles: The Importance of Explanations and Self-Care Advice in Treating Primary Dysmenorrhea with Acupuncture,"Background. Primary dysmenorrhea is a common gynaecological condition. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) acupuncturists commonly treat primary dysmenorrhea and dispense specific self-care advice for this condition. The impact of self-care advice on primary dysmenorrhea is unknown. Methods. 19 TCM acupuncture practitioners from New Zealand or Australia and 12 New Zealand women who had recently undergone acupuncture treatment for primary dysmenorrhea as part of a randomised controlled trial participated in this qualitative, pragmatic study. Focus groups and semistructured interviews were used to collect data. These were recorded, transcribed, and analysed using thematic analysis. Results. The overarching theme was that an acupuncture treatment consisted of ""more than needles"" for both practitioners and participants. Practitioners and participants both discussed the partnership they engaged in during treatment, based on openness and trust. Women felt that the TCM self-care advice was related to positive outcomes for their dysmenorrhea and increased their feelings of control over their menstrual symptoms. Conclusions. Most of the women in this study found improved symptom control and reduced pain. A contributing factor for these improvements may be an increased internal health locus of control and an increase in self-efficacy resulting from the self-care advice given during the clinical trial."
#1078,Electroacupuncture Regularizes Gastric Contraction and Reduces Apoptosis of Interstitial Cells of Cajal in Diabetic Rats,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Gastric dysmotility is a frequent complication among patients with diabetes mellitus. Electroacupuncture (EA) has been empirically used to relieve gastrointestinal symptoms. The aims of this study were to investigate the effects of EA on gastric contraction and the mechanisms of interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) involved. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized into the normal control, diabetes (DM), diabetic and sham EA (DM + SEA), diabetic and low-frequency EA (DM + LEA), and diabetic and high-frequency EA (DM + HEA) groups. Diabetic models were established and then treated with EA for 8 weeks. Body weight and blood glucose were recorded every 2 weeks. The spontaneous contractions of distal gastric strips were analyzed. Immunostaining and RT-PCR were used to test the apoptotic ICC, IGF-1/IGF-1R, and Nrf2/HO-1 pathways. RESULTS: The body weight in the DM + LEA and DM + HEA groups were increased compared with that of the DM group, though there was no effect on the blood glucose. The gastric contractions were obviously disordered in the DM group, but EA could regularize the contractions. The number of apoptotic ICC was dramatically increased in the DM group, but reduced with EA treatment. Meanwhile, the IGF-1/IGF-1R pathway was verified to be significantly altered in diabetic rats. The Nrf2/HO-1 pathway was not significantly increased in the DM group. EA with different frequencies efficiently improved the expression of IGF-1/IGF-1R signaling and activated the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway. CONCLUSION: EA could improve gastric motility dysfunction and attenuate ICC apoptosis possibly through the regulation of IGF-1/IGF-1R and Nrf2/HO-1 pathways. EA may be a potential therapeutic method for diabetic gastric motility dysfunction."
#1149,Use of complementary or alternative medicine in a general population in Great Britain. Results from the National Omnibus survey,"BACKGROUND: A representative sample of the adults in England, Scotland and Wales was interviewed to estimate levels of use of complementary or alternative medicines (CAMs) and their socio-economic correlates. METHODS: The Omnibus survey is a multi-purpose survey carried out in the United Kingdom by the Office for National Statistics on behalf of non-profit making organizations. The survey is carried out in 2 out of 3 months each quarter using a stratified random, probability sample of households. An eight-question module was added to the interview schedule of the survey in March 2001. Topics included practitioner-based use of 23 named CAM therapies in the past 12 months. The resulting data were analysed in conjunction with socio-economic and demographic variables. RESULTS: A response rate of 65 per cent (1794/2761) was achieved. An estimated 10.0 per cent of the population [95 per cent confidence interval (CI) 8.7-11.5 per cent] had received any CAM therapy from a practitioner in the past year. No individual therapy was used by more than 2 per cent of the sample. An estimated 6.5 per cent (95 per cent CI 5.4-7.6) had used one of the five main therapies: acupuncture, homeopathy, chiropractic, osteopathy or herbal medicine. Estimates of CAM use were similar in England, Scotland and Wales. There was a significant positive association between CAM use and non-manual social class (p < 0.002), age left full-time education (p < 0.001), and gross income over pounds sterling 15,600 (p < 0.001). More than half (52 per cent) of the respondents that had used CAM in the past year had not told their general practitioner. CONCLUSIONS: Strong correlations between the use of CAM and gross socio-economic indicators are demonstrated in the survey. Repeated national surveys of this type could provide a useful vehicle for collecting information about changing patterns of CAM use on a routine basis."
#1165,Non-drug therapies for lower limb muscle cramps,"BACKGROUND: About one in every three adults are affected by lower limb muscle cramps. For some people, these cramps reduce quality of life, quality of sleep and participation in activities of daily living. Many interventions are available for lower limb cramps, but some are controversial, no treatment guidelines exist, and often people experience no benefit from the interventions prescribed. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of non-drug, non-invasive treatments for lower limb cramp. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register (13 September 2011) using the terms: cramp, spasm, contracture, charley horse and lower limb, lower extremity, foot, calf, leg, thigh, gastrocnemius, hamstring, quadriceps. We also searched CENTRAL (2011, Issue 3), MEDLINE (January 1966 to August 2011) and EMBASE (January 1980 to August 2011) and the reference lists of included studies. There were no language or publication restrictions. SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomised controlled trials of non-drug, non-invasive interventions trialled over at least four weeks for the prevention of lower limb muscle cramps in any group of people. We excluded, for example, surgery, acupuncture and dry-needling, as invasive interventions. We selected only trials that included at least one of the following outcomes: cramp frequency, cramp severity, health-related quality of life, quality of sleep, participation in activities of daily living and adverse outcomes. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently selected trials, assessed risk of bias and cross checked data extraction and analysis. A third author was to arbitrate in the event of disagreement. We asked the authors of five trials for information to assist with screening studies for eligibility and received four responses. MAIN RESULTS: One trial was eligible for inclusion.  All participants were age 60 years or over and had received a repeat prescription from their general practitioner of quinine for nighttime cramps in the preceding three months. This review includes data from only those participants who were advised to continue taking quinine. Forty-nine participants were advised to complete lean-to-wall calf muscle stretching held for 10 s three times per day. Forty-eight participants were allocated to a placebo stretching group. After 12 weeks, there was no statistically significant difference in recalled cramp frequency between groups. No ""significant"" adverse effect was reported. Limitations in the study's design impede interpretation of the results and clinical applicability. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is limited evidence on which to base clinical decisions regarding the use of non-drug therapies for the treatment of lower limb muscle cramp. Serious methodological limitations in the existing evidence hinder clinical application. There is an urgent need to carefully evaluate many of the commonly recommended and emerging non-drug therapies in well designed randomised controlled trials."
#1258,Acupuncture for the treatment of sudden sensorineural hearing loss: A systematic review and meta-analysis: Acupuncture for SSNHL,"BACKGROUND: Acupuncture as an alternative treatment method is widely used in the treatment of sudden sensorineural hearing loss(SSNHL) in China. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the clinical efficacy of acupuncture for the management of SSNHL patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure and WanFang databases were searched. Searches were performed on April 27, 2018 and without language and publication year restrictions. We collected and analyzed the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of acupuncture for the treatment of SSNHL patients to assess its efficacy and safety. The RevMan5.3 software was used for analysis. The fixed-effects model can be applied to calculate the risk ratio (RR) or weighted mean difference (WMD) if the chi-square test shows there was no significance of heterogeneity (p > 0.10, I(2)<50%). Otherwise, the random effects mode was used. RESULTS: Twenty randomized controlled trials met our inclusion criteria. The electroacupuncture(EA), manual acupuncture(MA) plus western medicine(WM) and EA plus WM groups lead to significantly better pure tone audiometry(PTA) than WM alone in cured rate (P = 0.01; P < 00,001; P < 0.006, respectively). However, no significant differences were observed between MA and WM (p = 0.27). In terms of total effective rate, all of them showed significant improvement compared to WM alone (MA: P = 0.03; EA: P = 0.01; MA + WM: P < 0.00001; EA + WM: P = 0.04). In addition, no significant difference was found between the MA plus WM and WM alone groups in the improvement of tinnitus (P = 0.37). No trials reported serious adverse events. CONCLUSION: Acupuncture could be a valid treatment option for SSNHL, especially for patients who could not be cured by drugs alone. However, the outcome was limited temporarily due to the lack of high-quality research support. High-quality evidence is needed to clarify the future efficacy and safety of acupuncture for SSNHL."
#1313,Acupuncture and electroacupuncture for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis,"BACKGROUND: Acupuncture has been used by rehabilitation specialists as an adjunct therapy for the symptomatic treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese medicine where thin needles are inserted in specific documented points believed to represent concentration of body energies. In some cases a small electrical impulse is added to the needles. Once the needles are inserted in some of the appropriate points, endorphins, morphine-like substances, have been shown to be released in the patient's system, thus inducing local or generalised analgesia (pain relief). This review is an update of the original review published in July 2002. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effects of acupuncture or electroacupuncture on the objective and subjective measures of disease activity in patients with RA. SEARCH STRATEGY: A comprehensive search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, PEDro, Current Contents , Sports Discus and CINAHL, initially done in September 2001, was updated in May 2005. The Cochrane Field of Rehabilitation and Related Therapies and the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Review Group were also contacted for a search of their specialized registries. Handsearching was conducted on all retrieved papers and content experts were contacted to identify additional studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: Comparative controlled studies, such as randomized controlled trials and controlled clinical trials in patients with RA were eligible. Trials published in languages other than French and English were not analyzed. Abstracts were excluded unless further data could be obtained from the authors. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two independent reviewers identified potential articles from the literature search and extracted data using pre-defined extraction forms. Consensus was reached on all the extracted data. Quality was assessed by two reviewers using a five point validated tool that measured the quality of randomization, double-blinding and description of withdrawals. MAIN RESULTS: After the updated searches were conducted, five further potential articles were identified; however, these did not meet the inclusion criteria. Two studies involving a total of 84 people were included. One study used acupuncture while the other used electroacupuncture. In the acupuncture study, no statistically significant difference was found between groups for erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), visual analogue scale for patient's global assessment (VAS G), number of swollen joints and tender joints, general health questionnaire (GHQ), modified disease activity scale (DAS) or for the decrease in analgesic intake. Although not statistically significant, pain in the treatment group improved by 4 points on a 0-100mm visual analogue scale versus no improvement in the placebo group. In the second study, using electroacupuncture, a significant decrease in knee pain was reported in the experimental group, 24 hours post treatment, when compared to the placebo group (WMD: -2.0 with 95% CI -3.6,-4.0). A significant decrease was found also at four months post-treatment (WMD -0.2, 95% CI: -0.36, -0.04) AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Although the results of the study on electroacupuncture show that electroacupuncture may be beneficial to reduce symptomatic knee pain in patients with RA 24 hours and 4 months post treatment, the reviewers concluded that the poor quality of the trial, including the small sample size preclude its recommendation. The reviewers further conclude that acupuncture has no effect on ESR, CRP, pain, patient's global assessment, number of swollen joints, number of tender joints, general health, disease activity and reduction of analgesics. These conclusions are limited by methodological considerations such as the type of acupuncture (acupuncture vs electroacupuncture), the site of intervention, the low number of clinical trials and the small sample size of the included studies."
#1333,Comparative effectiveness of multiple acupuncture therapies for primary insomnia: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized trial,"BACKGROUND: Acupuncture has been widely practiced for primary insomnia (PI). However, the relative benefit and harm among acupuncture therapies remain uncertain. OBJECTIVES: To compare and evaluate the effect differences of multiple acupuncture therapies for patients with PI. METHODS: Systematic literature search for randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Pairs of reviewers independently conducted literature screening, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment. Meta-analysis was conducted using R and Stata software. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system (GRADE) was used to assess certainty of evidence and interpret results. RESULTS: Fifty-seven RCTs with 4678 patients were included. Compared with usual treatment, multiple acupuncture therapies showed a better effect for Pittsburgh sleep quality index score. And acupoints catgut embedding (ACE) was proved to be the most effective with a moderate certainty of evidence; auricular acupressure or auricular acupuncture plus manual acupuncture (AP + MA), electroacupuncture plus acupoint application (EA + APA), and intradermal needle (IN) might be also the most effective with low certainty of evidence. ACE, ACE + MA, AP + MA, EA, EA + APA, HPN, MA and PBN + MA showed significantly improvement in effective rate when compared with usual treatment. Insufficient evidence reported on Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Athens Insomnia Scale, and recurrence rate. The most common slight adverse events mainly included hematoma, pain, headache, and bleeding. CONCLUSIONS: With moderate to low certainty of evidence, multiple acupuncture therapies showed impressive insomnia improvement, especially ACE, AP + MA, and EA + APA. Differences between therapies were small or insignificant and based-on low or very low certainty of evidence."
#1347,"Heat and acupuncture restore mobility in knee osteoarthritis (HARMOKnee): A pragmatic integrated care, randomized controlled study","BACKGROUND: Acupuncture has increasingly gained popularity as alternative approach to conventional care for knee osteoarthritis (KOA) management. We conducted a pragmatic randomized controlled study to evaluate the clinical and health utility outcomes of acupuncture and heat therapy in conjunction with standard care for KOA. METHODS: Community-ambulating KOA patients of 45 years or older were randomly assigned to the intervention or control (SC) group. The HARMOKnee group received 12 acupuncture and heat treatments in addition to standard care for six weeks. We evaluated the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis and Outcome Score-12 (KOOS-12) at baseline, 6-, 12- and 24-week. Secondary outcomes including Pain, Enjoyment of Life and General Activity (PEG) scores, Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4), and TCM syndrome differentiation were evaluated. Comparative analysis was performed using mixed-effect models. RESULTS: Among 101 participants (HARMOKnee=50; SC=51), the mean age was 63.99 ± 7.03 years, and KOA duration was 5.07 ± 6.35 years. There was a significant intervention-time interaction, favouring HARMOKnee group, for the KOOS-12 total score [Coef= 6.43, 95 %CI: 0.72, 12.14; p = 0.027], KOOS-12 quality of life (QOL) domain-score [Coef= 8.50, 95 %CI: 1.28, 15.73; p = 0.021], and PEG overall score [Coef= -1.32, 95 %CI: -2.14, -0.49; p = 0.002] at 6-week. No between-group differences were identified at other time-points. The HARMOKnee group demonstrated considerable pain reduction and improved knee flexion and extension after 12 treatments (0.001 < p < 0.014). This treatment approach markedly enhanced knee flexion in patients with Kidney yang deficiency with phlegm and blood stasis syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: HARMOKnee provides short-term pain-management benefits to KOA patients compared to standard care alone, particularly in patients with Kidney yang deficiency with phlegm and blood stasis syndrome."
#1362,GABAergic Inhibition of Spinal Cord Dorsal Horns Contributes to Analgesic Effect of Electroacupuncture in Incisional Neck Pain Rats,"BACKGROUND: Acupuncture has shown to be effective in relieving post-surgical pain. Nonetheless, its underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. In the present study, we investigated the effect of electroacupuncture (EA) on the expression of GABA, GABA-A receptor (R) and GABA-BR in the spinal cord dorsal horns (DHs), and the involved neural cells in rats with incisional neck pain. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male SD rats were randomly divided into control, model, Futu (LI18), Hegu-Neiguan (LI4-PC6), and Zusanli-Yanglingquan (ST36-GB34) groups. The incisional neck pain model was established by making a longitudinal incision and repeated mechanical separation along the thyroid gland region. EA (2Hz/100Hz, 1mA) was applied to LI18, LI4-PC6, ST36-GB34 separately for 30min, once at 4, 24 and 48h after incision. The local thermal pain threshold (TPT) of the focus was measured and the expression of GABA, and GABAR proteins and mRNAs detected by immunofluorescence stain and quantitative RT-PCR, respectively. RESULTS: The analgesic effect of LI18 and LI4-PC6 was superior to that of ST36-GB34 in incisional neck pain rats. Moreover, the EA stimulation of LI18 or LI4-PC6 increased the expression of GABA and GABA-Aα2 and GABA-Aβ3, GABA-B1, and GABA-B2 mRNAs in spinal DHs 4h after surgery, while GABA-A and GABA-B antagonists inhibited the analgesic effect of LI18. Immunofluorescence double staining showed that GABA was expressed on astrocytes and neurons, and GABA-B expressed only on neurons. CONCLUSION: EA of both LI18 and LI4-PC6 has a good analgesic effect in incisional neck pain rats, which is closely related to their effects in upregulating the expression of GABA and its receptors in spinal DHs. The effects of LI18 and LI4-PC6 EA are obviously better that those of ST36-GB34 EA, and GABA is expressed on neurons and astrocytes."
#1386,Developing a deep learning model for the automated monitoring of acupuncture needle insertion: enhancing safety in traditional acupuncture practices,"BACKGROUND: Acupuncture is a widely practiced traditional therapy, yet safety concerns, particularly needle breakage and retention, remain critical issues that can lead to complications such as infections, organ injury, or chronic pain. This study aimed to develop a deep learning model to monitor acupuncture needle insertion, detect instances of needle breakage, and prevent needle retention, ultimately improving patient safety and treatment outcomes. METHODS: A deep learning model based on the YOLOv8 architecture was trained using a dataset comprising 192 images from a commercial image library and 73 clinical images captured during real-world acupuncture sessions. Images were preprocessed through cropping and annotation, and augmented to enhance model generalizability. Five-fold cross-validation was employed to ensure robust performance. Model evaluation metrics included precision, recall, F1 score, and mean average precision (mAP) at Intersection over Union (IoU) thresholds of 50% (mAP@50) and 50-95% (mAP@50-95). RESULTS: The model demonstrated strong performance, achieving an average precision of 88.0% and a recall of 82.9%. The mean average precision was 88.6% at mAP@50 and 62.9% at mAP@50-95, indicating high reliability in detecting acupuncture needles across diverse scenarios. These results highlight the potential of the model to enhance clinical safety by minimizing risks associated with needle breakage and retention, regardless of practitioner experience or patient demographics. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed YOLOv8-based deep learning model offers a reliable method for real-time needle monitoring in acupuncture. Its integration into clinical workflows can improve safety and efficiency, especially in underserved regions or settings with less experienced practitioners. Future research should validate the model with larger, more diverse datasets and explore its application in various healthcare settings. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Not applicable; this study did not involve a healthcare intervention requiring registration. Data collection adhered to ethical standards with institutional approval (TCHIRB-11310004)."
#1562,Using Religious Songs as an Integrative and Complementary Therapy for the Management of Psychological Symptoms Among African American Cancer Survivors,"BACKGROUND: Acupuncture, acupressure, yoga, meditation, cognitive-behavioral techniques, and, to a lesser extent, music are among those integrative and complementary therapies with known beneficial effects on psychological symptoms. However, noticeably absent from this research is the use of religious song as a type of integrative and complementary therapy. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore how religious songs were used to alleviate psychological symptoms associated with a cancer diagnosis among a sample of older African American cancer survivors. DESIGN AND METHODS: Thirty-one older African American cancer survivors residing in the Southeastern US participated in a qualitative descriptive study involving criterion sampling, open-ended semistructured interviews, and qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: Participants used religious songs in response to feeling depressed, low, or sad; feeling weak and seeking strength to endure treatment; and feeling worried, anxious, or fearful. Religious songs were also a source of support and hope. Types of religious songs included instructive, thanksgiving and praise, memory of forefathers, communication with God, and life after death. CONCLUSION: Religious songs appear to be an important form of religious expression in this population and used to manage psychological symptoms. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Integrative and complementary oncology therapy has generally focused on yoga, meditation, acupuncture, and cognitive-behavioral techniques. However, religious songs are an important strategy used among older African American cancer patients. Religious songs can be readily integrated into cancer care. The incorporation of religious songs into spiritually based support groups and other integrative and complementary therapies might enhance health outcomes among this medically underserved cancer population."
#1584,Fire needle plus cupping for acute herpes zoster: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Acute herpes zoster (AHZ) is a common skin disease caused by invasion of the varicella zoster virus into the ganglia and skin, and the severe pain is the most complaint, which can seriously disturb the normal life of patients. Fire needle plus cupping is a special acupuncture treatment, which is widely used to treat AHZ for its better analgesic effect in China although it has not been fully verified by rigorous randomized controlled trial (RCT). METHODS/DESIGN: To test the effect, a three-arm randomized parallel controlled trial protocol has been designed. A total of 105 AHZ patients suffering pain will be randomly divided into three groups in an equal proportion. The interventions are fire needle plus cupping (FC) in group A, famciclovir plus gabapentin (FG) in group B, and fire needle plus cupping plus famciclovir (FCF) in group C. The length for the trial is set for a week time frame. Precisely speaking, the A group (FC) is to carry out 1 treatment per day for the total of 7 treatment sessions within 1 week period. On the other hand, the B group (FG) will take drugs orally three times a day within the trial 1 week. Meanwhile, with its combination element, the C group (FCF) is due to undertake both treatments and drugs as prescribed for A and B groups within the trial week. As an intra-trial arrangement, analgesic medication will be carefully administered for temporary pain release if the sudden intolerable pain appeared. For the primary outcome, this study is due to apply visual analogue scale to identify pain intensity relief. As the secondary outcomes are concerned, this study is aiming to focus on the issues related to changes in substance P and beta-endorphin concentrations in peripheral plasma, as well as those issues of analgesic needs, side effects, symptoms, and physical signs including pain classification, local itching, burning sensation, fever, local lymphadenopathy, skin lesion area, blisters, herpes clusters, vesicular traits, ulcers, and pimples; all these are taken into account for evaluation. For the final stage, the participants are to be followed up for postherpetic neuralgia. DISCUSSION: The results of this trial aim to provide sufficient evidence on FC treatment over both FG and FCF treatments. It will then give a credible alternative treatment to cut down acute pain and to cure AHZ infection. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry ChiCTR1800015372 .

#1599,Efficacy and safety of acupuncture for adenomyosis: A protocol for systematic review and meta-analysis,"BACKGROUND: Adenomyosis (AM) is a disease in which the endometrium (including glands and stroma) invades the myometrium and grows. The main clinical symptoms include menorrhagia, dysmenorrhea, chronic pelvic pain, metrorrhagia, and dyspareunia, which will seriously affect the physical and mental health of patients, and most of which occur in women of childbearing age. Acupuncture, as a special external treatment of Traditional Chinese medicine, has shown good effects in the treatment of adenomyosis. At present, there is a lack of systematic review on acupuncture in the treatment of adenomyosis. We conduct this study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of acupuncture in the treatment of adenomyosis. METHODS: We will search Chinese and English databases: Medline, Pubmed, EMBASE, Cochrane library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Chinese Scientific and Journal Database, Wan Fang database (Wanfang), Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM) to identify articles of randomized clinical trials of acupuncture for adenomyosis. All above electronic databases will be searched from inception to September 30, 2021. RevMan 5.3 software will be used to conduct this systematic review. No language and publication status restrictions will be applied. RESULTS: The study will prove the efficacy and safety of acupuncture for adenomyosis. CONCLUSION: We plan to submit this systematic review to a peer-reviewed journal. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42021277136."
#1612,The effect of TCM acupuncture on hot flushes among menopausal women (ACUFLASH) study: a study protocol of an ongoing multi-centre randomised controlled clinical trial,"BACKGROUND: After menopause, 10-20% of all women have nearly intolerable hot flushes. Long term use of hormone replacement therapy involves a health risk, and many women seek alternative strategies to relieve climacteric complaints. Acupuncture is one of the most frequently used complementary therapies in Norway. We designed a study to evaluate whether Traditional Chinese Medicine acupuncture-care together with self-care is more effective than self-care alone to relieve climacteric complaints. METHODS/DESIGN: The study is a multi-centre pragmatic randomised controlled trial with two parallel arms. Participants are postmenopausal women who document > or =7 flushes/24 hours and who are not using hormone replacement therapy or other medication that may influence flushes. According to power calculations 200 women are needed to detect a 50% reduction in flushes, and altogether 286 women will be recruited to allow for a 30% dropout rate. The treatment group receives 10 sessions of Traditional Chinese Medicine acupuncture-care and self-care; the control group will engage in self-care only. A team of experienced Traditional Chinese Medicine acupuncturists give acupuncture treatments. DISCUSSION: The study tests acupuncture as a complete treatment package including the therapeutic relationship and expectation. The intervention period lasts for 12 weeks, with follow up at 6 and 12 months. Primary endpoint is change in daily hot flush frequency in the two groups from baseline to 12 weeks; secondary endpoint is health related quality of life, assessed by the Women's Health Questionnaire. We also collect data on Traditional Chinese Medicine diagnoses, and we examine treatment experiences using a qualitative approach. Finally we measure biological variables, to examine potential mechanisms for the effect of acupuncture. The study is funded by The Research Council of Norway."
#1614,Moxibustion for declined cardiorespiratory fitness of apparently healthy older adults: A study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Aging and age-related declines lead to varying degrees of decreased cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) in apparently healthy older adults. Exercise training, the primary approach for enhancing CRF, encounters several constraints when used with elderly individuals. Existing evidence implies that moxibustion might enhance the CRF of older adults. However, clinical research in this area still needs to be improved. METHODS: This study will employ a randomized, assessor-blinded, controlled trial design involving 126 eligible participants. These participants will be stratified and randomly assigned to one moxibustion group, one sham moxibustion group, and one blank control group. Acupoints of bilateral Zusanli (ST36), Shenque (CV8), and Guanyuan (CV4) are selected for both real and sham moxibustion groups. The treatment will last 60 min per session, 5 sessions a week for 12 weeks. The blank control group will not receive any intervention for CRF improvement. Primary outcomes will be the mean change in peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak), anaerobic threshold (AT), and serum central carbon metabolites (CCB) from the baseline to observation points. Secondary outcome measures involve the six-minute walk distance (6MWD), the Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36), and the Qi and Blood Status Questionnaire (QBSQ). Outcome assessments will be conducted at weeks 4, 8, 12, and 24 as part of the follow-up. Adverse events will be assessed at each visit. DISCUSSION: This trial can potentially ascertain moxibustion's effectiveness and safety in enhancing CRF among apparently healthy older adults. TRAIL REGISTRATION: ChiCTR, ChiCTR2300070303.

#1706,Effect of acupuncture at Zusanli (ST36) point on antral contraction function under ultrasound guidance: study protocol of a randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Although the relationship between deqi sensations and curative effect has always been controversial, deqi sensations has been regarded as the key indicator of clinical efficacy of acupuncture therapy. There is little evidence for standardization or visualization of the mechanism of acupuncture's therapeutic effect. This trial aims to evaluate the effect of needling at Zusanli (ST36) on antral contraction function as visualized by ultrasound. METHODS: This is a two-arm, single-blind, randomized, controlled trial. A total of 116 acupuncture-naïve healthy subjects will be randomly allocated to the acupuncture group or sham acupuncture group in a 1:1 ratio. Participants in the acupuncture group will receive manual acupuncture at Zusanli (ST36) with the needling depth at crural interosseous membrane. Those in the sham acupuncture group will be given penetrating needling depth at the superficial fascia layer. The primary outcome will be the changes in antral contraction frequency (ACF) before and after acupuncture. The secondary outcomes will be the changes in the thermal infrared spectrum of gastric area skin, the antral contraction amplitude (ACA), the antral movement index (AMI), and the scores on the Chinese version of Massachusetts General Hospital Acupuncture Sensation Scale (C-MASS). The adverse events will be evaluated and recorded in detail. DISCUSSION: This study may provide visual and objective evidence regarding the safety and efficacy of manual acupuncture at Zusanli (ST36). In addition, the results of this study will help to identify the role of Zusanli (ST36)in the inducing deqi. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry ChiCTR2000040686 .

#1708,Acupuncture anesthesia for open heart surgery in contemporary China,"BACKGROUND: Although the use of acupuncture anesthesia for open heart surgery, which was introduced in China four decades ago, has declined in recent years, there is a renewed interest in it in contemporary China due to the escalating medical costs associated with open heart surgery. This study was aimed to determine whether a combined acupuncture-medicine anesthesia (CAMA) strategy reduces early postoperative morbidity and medical costs in patients undergoing open heart operation under cardiopulmonary bypass. METHODS: From July 2006 to October 2010, CAMA was applied in 100 patients undergoing open heart surgery in comparison with another 100 patients under the conventional general anesthesia (GA). For all the CAMA patients, an abdominal breathing training program was practiced for the 3 consecutive days prior to operation. About 15 to 20 min prior to surgical incision, acupuncture needles were inserted into the bilateral points ZhongFu, LieQue, and XiMen. During operation, patients were kept on spontaneous breathing. Endotracheal intubation was not employed but only prepared as a standby. The narcotic drugs, fentanyl and midazolam, were intravenously injected but in very low doses as compared to GA. Open heart procedures were performed routinely in both groups. RESULTS: Compared with the GA patients, the CAMA patients had a less usage of narcotic drugs (p<0.001), less postoperative pulmonary infection (p<0.05), shorter stay in intensive care unit (p<0.05), and a lower medical cost (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: A combined acupuncture-medicine anesthesia strategy reduces the postoperative morbidity and medical costs in patients undergoing open heart surgery under cardiopulmonary bypass."
#1835,The brain effects of laser acupuncture in healthy individuals: an FMRI investigation,"BACKGROUND: As laser acupuncture is being increasingly used to treat mental disorders, we sought to determine whether it has a biologically plausible effect by using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the cerebral activation patterns from laser stimulation of relevant acupoints. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Ten healthy subjects were randomly stimulated with a fibreoptic infrared laser on 4 acupoints (LR14, CV14, LR8 and HT7) used for depression following the principles of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), and 1 control non-acupoint (sham point) in a blocked design (alternating verum laser and placebo laser/rest blocks), while the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI response was recorded from the whole brain on a 3T scanner. Many of the acupoint laser stimulation conditions resulted in different patterns of neural activity. Regions with significantly increased activation included the limbic cortex (cingulate) and the frontal lobe (middle and superior frontal gyrus). Laser acupuncture tended to be associated with ipsilateral brain activation and contralateral deactivation that therefore cannot be simply attributed to somatosensory stimulation. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We found that laser stimulation of acupoints lead to activation of frontal-limbic-striatal brain regions, with the pattern of neural activity somewhat different for each acupuncture point. This is the first study to investigate laser acupuncture on a group of acupoints useful in the management of depression. Differing activity patterns depending on the acupoint site were demonstrated, suggesting that neurological effects vary with the site of stimulation. The mechanisms of activation and deactivation and their effects on depression warrant further investigation."
#1842,Comparative effectiveness of external therapies of traditional Chinese medicine and surgical treatments in pain management of postherpetic neuralgia: A protocol for a systematic review and network meta-analysis,"BACKGROUND: As the most common long-term complication of herpes zoster (HZ), postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is characterized by chronic, persistent, and debilitating neuropathic pain. PHN seriously harms human health and currently becomes a topic of clinical importance. To date, the common methods of pain management in PHN include external therapies of traditional Chinese medicine and surgical treatments. However, there is no high-quality or direct evidence of their comparative effectiveness. This review aims to provide a network meta-analysis to compare the efficacy of external therapies of traditional Chinese medicine and surgical treatments in the pain management of PHN. METHODS: Databases such as PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, China Biology Medicine Disc will be searched for relevant randomized controlled trials to obtain literatures on the treatment of PHN with external therapies of traditional Chinese medicine and surgical treatments, and clinical randomized controlled trials will be screened out from their inception to August 5, 2022. The participant intervention comparator outcomes of this study are as flowing: P, patients with PHN; I, external therapies of traditional Chinese medicine and surgical treatments; C, no treatment, pharmacological placebo, treatment as usual or sham acupuncture groups; O, primary outcome is pain intensity, and secondary outcomes are onset of pain relief time, quality of life, therapeutic effective rate and reverse effects. Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool will be used in assessing literature's quality. Network meta-analyses will be conducted to generate estimates of comparative effectiveness of each intervention class and rankings of their effectiveness, in terms of pain management. RESULT: This systematic review and network meta-analysis will provide evidence of the efficacy of different therapeutic methods for pain management in PHN, to show which forms of therapy are more commonly used with higher effectiveness. DISCUSSION: The results will systematically provide suggestions for medical practitioners to choose effective, time-saving and economical pain management method for PHN."
#1905,Acupuncture for chronic low back pain in older adults: Design and protocol for the BackInAction pragmatic clinical trial,"BACKGROUND: Back pain prevalence and burden increase with age; approximately one-third of U.S. adults 65 years of age and older experience lower back pain (LBP). For chronic low back pain (cLBP), typically defined as lasting three months or longer, many treatments for younger adults may be inappropriate for older adults given their greater prevalence of comorbidities with attendant polypharmacy. While acupuncture has been demonstrated to be safe and effective for cLBP in adults overall, few studies of acupuncture have either included or focused on adults ≥65 years old. METHODS: The BackInAction study is a pragmatic, multi-site, three-arm, parallel-groups randomized controlled trial designed to test the effectiveness of acupuncture needling for improving back pain-related disability among 807 older adults ≥65 years old with cLBP. Participants are randomized to standard acupuncture (SA; up to 15 treatment sessions across 12 weeks), enhanced acupuncture (EA; SA during first 12 weeks and up to 6 additional sessions across the following 12 weeks), and usual medical care (UMC) alone. Participants are followed for 12 months with study outcomes assessed monthly with the primary outcome timepoint at 6 months. DISCUSSION: The BackInAction study offers an opportunity to further understand the effectiveness, dose-dependence, and safety of acupuncture in a Medicare population. Additionally, study results may encourage broader adoption of more effective, safer, and more satisfactory options to the continuing over-reliance on opioid- and invasive medical treatments for cLBP among older adults.

#1956,"Topiramate, acupuncture, and BoNT-A for chronic migraine: a network meta-analysis","BACKGROUND: Botulinum neurotoxin A (BoNT-A) was the primary choice for preventive treatment of chronic migraine. Topiramate and acupuncture showed promising effect for chronic migraine, but their effectiveness relative to BoNT-A was rarely studied. We aimed to perform a network meta-analysis to compare the effectiveness and acceptability between topiramate, acupuncture, and BoNT-A. METHODS: We searched OVID Medline, Embase, the Cochrane register of controlled trials (CENTRAL), the Chinese Clinical Trial Register, and clinicaltrials.gov for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared topiramate, acupuncture, and BoNT-A with any of them or placebo in the preventive treatment of chronic migraine. A network meta-analysis was performed by using a frequentist approach and a random-effects model. The primary outcomes were reduction in monthly headache days and monthly migraine days at week 12. Acceptability was defined as the number of dropouts owing to adverse events. RESULTS: We included 15 RCTs (n = 2545). Eleven RCTs were at low risk of bias. The network meta-analyses (n = 2061) showed that acupuncture (2061 participants; standardized mean difference [SMD] -1.61, 95% CI: -2.35 to -0.87) and topiramate (582 participants; SMD -0.4, 95% CI: -0.75 to -0.04) ranked the most effective in the reduction of monthly headache days and migraine days, respectively; but they were not significantly superior over BoNT-A. Topiramate caused the most treatment-related adverse events and the highest rate of dropouts owing to adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Topiramate and acupuncture were not superior over BoNT-A; BoNT-A was still the primary preventive treatment of chronic migraine. Large-scale RCTs with direct comparison of these three treatments are warranted to verified the findings."
#2037,A Data Mining Study for Analysis of Acupoint Selection and Combinations in Acupuncture Treatment of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome,"BACKGROUND: Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most prevalent upper limb compressive neuropathy. A considerable number of clinical trials and meta-analyses have provided evidence supporting the effectiveness of acupuncture in treating CTS. Nevertheless, the ideal choice of acupoints remains ambiguous. OBJECTIVE: A data mining analysis was conducted with the objective of determining the most effective acupoint combinations and selection for CTS. METHODS: A search was conducted across seven Chinese and English electronic bibliographic databases spanning from their inception to March 2023. Selected were clinical trials that evaluated the efficacy of acupuncture therapy for CTS, with or without randomised controlled methods. Data extraction mainly included acupoint prescriptions. Information such as first author, study design and study setting were also extracted. The principal outcomes comprised the clinical manifestations linked to CTS. Statistical descriptions were generated using Excel 2019. The analysis of association rules was conducted using SPSS Modeler 18.0. Using SPSS Statistics 26.0, exploratory factor analysis and cluster analysis were conducted. RESULTS: 142 trials (including 86 RCTs and 56 non RCTs) were identified, and 193 groups of effective prescriptions involving 68 acupoints were extracted. The most frequently used acupoints were Da-ling (PC7), Nei-guan (PC6), He-gu (LI4), Wai-guan (TE5), and Yang-xi (LI5). The most frequently used meridians were the pericardial meridian and the large intestine meridian. The majority of special acupoints used were Five-shu points and Yuan-source points, with acupoints on the upper limbs being the most frequently used. The core acupoint groups were analyzed and 11 groups of association rules, 8 factors, and 5 effective cluster groups were obtained. CONCLUSION: The evidence-based acupoint selection and combinations of acupuncture therapy for carpal tunnel syndrome were provided by the findings of this study."
#2112,Acupuncture for chronic hepatitis B,"BACKGROUND: Chronic hepatitis B is a liver disease associated with high morbidity and mortality. Chronic hepatitis B requires long-term management aiming to reduce the risks of hepatocellular inflammatory necrosis, liver fibrosis, decompensated liver cirrhosis, liver failure, and liver cancer, as well as to improve health-related quality of life. Acupuncture is being used to decrease discomfort and improve immune function in people with chronic hepatitis B. However, the benefits and harms of acupuncture still need to be established in a rigorous way. OBJECTIVES: To assess the benefits and harms of acupuncture versus no intervention or sham acupuncture in people with chronic hepatitis B. SEARCH METHODS: We undertook electronic searches of the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, Science Citation Index Expanded, Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Chongqing VIP (CQVIP), Wanfang Data, and SinoMed to 1 March 2019. We also searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (www.who.int/ictrp), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov/), and the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR) for ongoing or unpublished trials until 1 March 2019. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised clinical trials, irrespective of publication status, language, and blinding, comparing acupuncture versus no intervention or sham acupuncture in people with chronic hepatitis B. We included participants of any sex and age, diagnosed with chronic hepatitis B as defined by the trialists or according to guidelines. We allowed co-interventions when the co-interventions were administered equally to all intervention groups. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Review authors in pairs individually retrieved data from reports and through correspondence with investigators. Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, proportion of participants with one or more serious adverse events, and health-related quality of life. Secondary outcomes were hepatitis B-related mortality, hepatitis B-related morbidity, and adverse events considered not to be serious. We presented the pooled results as risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed the risks of bias using risk of bias domains with predefined definitions. We put more weight on the estimate closest to zero effect when results with fixed-effect and random-effects models differed. We evaluated the certainty of evidence using GRADE. MAIN RESULTS: We included eight randomised clinical trials with 555 randomised participants. All included trials compared acupuncture versus no intervention. These trials assessed heterogeneous acupuncture interventions. All trials used heterogeneous co-interventions applied equally in the compared groups. Seven trials included participants with chronic hepatitis B, and one trial included participants with chronic hepatitis B with comorbid tuberculosis. All trials were assessed at overall high risk of bias, and the certainty of evidence for all outcomes was very low due to high risk of bias for each outcome, imprecision of results (the confidence intervals were wide), and publication bias (small sample size of the trials, and all trials were conducted in China). Additionally, 79 trials lacked the necessary methodological information to ensure their inclusion in our review.None of the included trials aim to assess all-cause mortality, serious adverse events, health-related quality of life, hepatitis B-related mortality, and hepatitis B-related morbidity. We are uncertain whether acupuncture, compared with no intervention, has an effect regarding adverse events considered not to be serious (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.06; I² = 0%; 3 trials; 203 participants; very low-certainty evidence) or detectable hepatitis B e-antigen (HBeAg) (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.11 to 3.68; I² = 98%; 2 trials; 158 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Acupuncture showed a reduction in detectable hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA (a non-validated surrogate outcome; RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.74; 1 trial, 58 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether acupuncture has an effect regarding the remaining separately reported adverse events considered not to be serious.Three of the eight included trials received academic funding from government or hospital. None of the remaining five trials reported information on funding. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The clinical effects of acupuncture for chronic hepatitis B remain unknown. The included trials lacked data on all-cause mortality, health-related quality of life, serious adverse events, hepatitis-B related mortality, and hepatitis-B related morbidity. The vast number of excluded trials lacked clear descriptions of their design and conduct. Whether acupuncture influences adverse events considered not to be serious is uncertain. It remains unclear if acupuncture affects HBeAg, and if it is associated with reduction in detectable HBV DNA. Based on available data from only one or two small trials on adverse events considered not to be serious and on the surrogate outcomes HBeAg and HBV DNA, the certainty of evidence is very low. In view of the wide usage of acupuncture, any conclusion that one might try to draw in the future should be based on data on patient and clinically relevant outcomes, assessed in large, high-quality randomised sham-controlled trials with homogeneous groups of participants and transparent funding."
#2117,Dose-effect relationship of different acupuncture courses on chronic insomnia disorder: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Chronic insomnia disorder (CID) is increasing in prevalence year by year, is long lasting, and potentially risky. Acupuncture has been widely used in the clinical management of this condition. However, there is still a lack of direct evidence on the dose-effect relationship between different acupuncture courses and clinical efficacy. To identify this relationship, we will design a randomized controlled trial to clarify the difference in efficacy of different acupuncture courses for CID. METHODS AND DESIGN: This is a prospective, parallel, single center randomized controlled trial. Two hundred and one participants with CID will be randomly divided into three groups (Group A, Group B, and Group C). The three groups will be given acupuncture therapy for 4, 6, and 8 weeks, three sessions per week, with at least 1 day between sessions. Follow-up will continue until the third month after the end of treatment. The primary outcome is the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), and secondary outcomes include percentage of ISI < 8 points, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS), Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), medication use, and safety. DISCUSSION: This study is expected to provide direct evidence for the optimal treatment cycle of acupuncture for CID, as well as to facilitate health economic evaluation.

#2132,Effect of electroacupuncture on opioid consumption in patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain: protocol of a randomised controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Chronic musculoskeletal pain is common and has been increasingly managed by opioid medications, of which the long-term efficacy is unknown. Furthermore, there is evidence that long-term use of opioids is associated with reduced pain control, declining physical function and quality of life, and could hinder the goals of integrated pain management. Electroacupuncture (EA) has been shown to be effective in reducing postoperative opioid consumption. Limited evidence suggests that acupuncture could assist patients with chronic pain to reduce their requirements for opioids.The proposed research aims to assess if EA is an effective adjunct therapy to standard pain and medication management in reducing opioids use by patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain. METHODS: In this multicentre, randomised, sham-acupuncture controlled, three-arm clinical trial, 316 patients regularly taking opioids for pain control and meeting the defined selection criteria will be recruited from pain management centres and clinics of primary care providers in Victoria, Australia. After a four-week run-in period, the participants are randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups to receive EA, sham EA or no-EA with a ratio of 2:1:1. All participants receive routine pain medication management delivered and supervised by the trial medical doctors. Twelve sessions of semi-structured EA or sham EA treatment are delivered over 10 weeks. Upon completion of the acupuncture treatment period, there is a 12-week follow-up. In total, participants are involved in the trial for 26 weeks. Outcome measures of opioid and non-opioid medication consumption, pain scores and opioid-related adverse events are documented throughout the study. Quality of life, depression, function, and attitude to pain medications are also assessed. DISCUSSION: This randomised controlled trial will determine whether EA is of significant clinical value in assisting the management of debilitating chronic pain by reducing opioids consumption and their associated adverse events, as well as improving the quality of life for those with chronic pain. Such an outcome will provide the rationale for including EA into multidisciplinary programmes for effective management of chronic musculoskeletal pain.

#2154,"Efficacy of acupuncture as an adjunctive treatment to patients with stable COPD: a multicenter, randomized, sham-controlled trial protocol","BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common respiratory disease and the third leading cause of death worldwide. Previous evidence has shown that acupuncture may be an effective complementary alternative therapy for stable COPD. However, large-sample, rigorously designed long-term follow-up studies still need to be completed. Notably, the relationship between the frequency of acupuncture and clinical efficacy in studies on acupuncture for stable COPD still needs further validation. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of acupuncture for stable COPD and further investigate the dose-effect relationship of acupuncture. METHODS/DESIGN: This is a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial that uses central randomization to randomly allocate 550 participants in a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio to once a week acupuncture group, twice a week acupuncture group, three times a week acupuncture group, sham acupuncture group and waiting-list control group. The sham acupuncture group will receive placebo acupuncture treatments three times per week, and the waiting-list control group will not receive any form of acupuncture intervention. The study consists of a 2-week baseline, 12-week of treatment, and 52-week of follow-up. Patients with COPD between 40 to 80 years old who have received stable Western medication within the previous 3 months and have had at least 1 moderate or severe acute exacerbation within the past 1 year will be included in the study. Basic treatment will remain the same for all participants. The primary outcome is the proportion of responders at week 12. Secondary outcomes include the proportion of responders at week 64, change in the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) Scale, change in the Modified-Medical Research Council (mMRC) Scale, change in the COPD Assessment Test (CAT) Scale, change in the Lung Function Screening Indicators (LFSI), change in the 6-min walk distance (6-MWD), change in Short-Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36) Scale, the number of moderate and severe acute exacerbations and adverse event rate during the follow-up period. DISCUSSION: This study will provide robust evidence on whether acupuncture is safe and effective for treating stable COPD. Meanwhile, comparing the differences in efficacy between different acupuncture frequencies will further promote the optimization of acupuncture for stable COPD.

#2163,Research Trends of Acupuncture Therapy for Chronic Pain-Related Depression or Anxiety from 2003 to 2023: A Bibliometric Analysis,"BACKGROUND: Chronic pain (CP) as a long-lasting stressor can often cause mood disorders, such as depression or anxiety. The comorbidity of CP and mood disorders poses challenges for treatment and increases healthcare costs. Acupuncture has emerged as a widely utilized approach to alleviate both CP and mood disorders. However, there is a lack of well-established bibliometric analyses in this area of research. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the current hotspots and research trends regarding the use of acupuncture for treating CP-related depression or anxiety. METHODS: We searched the Web of Science Core Collection spanning from 2003 to 2023 to identify relevant literature about the use of acupuncture for treating CP-related depression or anxiety. Bibliometric and visualization analyses were performed using CiteSpace 5.7.R5 and Vosviewer 1.6.19 software. RESULTS: A total of 254 articles published between 2003 and 2023 were included, revealing an upward trajectory with some fluctuations in publication numbers over the past two decades. China and the Beijing University of Chinese Medicine were the most productive country and institution in this field. Fang JQ and Vickers AJ ascended as the most prolific and influential authors, respectively. Trials was the journal with the highest number of publications, while Pain and BMJ-British Medical Journal exhibited the highest citation and centrality, respectively. ""Acupuncture"", ""depression"", and ""chronic pain"" were the top three keywords. The hotspots in this domain encompass types of chronic pain that predispose to negative mood, including fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and neuropathic pain. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), mechanisms, and evidence-based evaluations are the main research directions. CONCLUSION: This study uses bibliometric techniques to analyze the research hotspots and forefronts of acupuncture as a therapeutic approach for CP-related depression or anxiety. Our objective is to provide researchers with valuable references and identify research focal points for future investigations."
#2208,Acupuncture for chronic uncomplicated musculoskeletal pain associated with the spine: A systematic review protocol,"BACKGROUND: Chronic uncomplicated neck pain, back pain, and lower back pain, with incidences of 18%, 17.7% and 36%, respectively. Although these three conditions occur in different parts of the body, we can summarize them as chronic uncomplicated musculoskeletal pain associated with the spine (CMPS) in accordance with the pathogenesis. Acupuncture is often used to treat them. We aim to conduct a systematic review to evaluate the efficacy of acupuncture for patients experiencing CMPS. METHODS: The following electronic databases will be searched from inception to Mar 2019: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Springer, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, VIP Chinese Science and Technology Periodical Database, and Wanfang Database. All randomized controlled trials published in English or Chinese related to acupuncture for CMPS will be included. The primary outcome will be the visual analog scale. Adverse events will be evaluated as secondary outcomes for safety evaluation. Study selection, data extraction, and assessment of study quality will be performed independently by two reviewers. RevMan V.5.3.5 software will be used for the assessment of risk of bias and data synthesis. RESULTS: This study will provide a high-quality synthesis of current evidence of acupuncture for CMPS from visual analog scale. CONCLUSION: The conclusion of our study will provide an evidence to judge whether acupuncture is an effective intervention for patients suffered from CMPS. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Formal ethical approval is not required, as the data are not individualized. The findings of this systematic review will be disseminated in a peer-reviewed publication and/or presented at relevant conferences. PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42018114806."
#2211,Cupping therapy for patients with chronic urticaria: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"BACKGROUND: Chronic urticaria (CU) is a common skin disease, which has a negative effect on quality of life. Current treatments do not fully control the symptoms of urticaria for many CU patients, thus effective and safe treatments for CU are still needed. OBJECTIVE: This review aims to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of cupping therapy in patients with CU. SEARCH STRATEGY: The search strategy looked for the presence of related keywords, such as ""chronic urticaria"" and ""cupping therapy,"" in the title and abstract of research articles indexed in major databases. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were selected after querying nine electronic databases from their inception to May 2019 with the above search terms. INCLUSION CRITERIA: RCTs were included if they recruited patients with CU who were intervened with dry or wet cupping. Publications could be written in Chinese or English. DATA EXTRACTION AND ANALYSIS: Data were extracted, and the studies were assessed for the quality of their methodological design and risk of bias. Meta-analyses of the RCT data were conducted to assess the total effective rate of the treatment as the primary outcome. Skin disease quality of life index score, recurrence rate, and adverse events were assessed as secondary outcomes. Subgroup analyses were conducted based on different interventions. RESULTS: Thirteen comparisons from 12 RCTs involving 842 participants were included. There were no significant differences between wet cupping and medications in total effective rate (n = 372; risk ratio [RR] = 1.10, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.97 to 1.25; P = 0.14) or recurrence rate (n = 240; RR = 0.56, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.36; P = 0.20). Cupping therapy, in combination with antihistamine treatment was more efficacious than antihistamines alone, with a greater total effective rate (n = 342; RR = 1.18, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.39; P = 0.03) and lower recurrence rate (n = 342; RR = 0.52, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.84; P = 0.007). Cupping therapy combined with acupuncture was more effective than acupuncture alone (n = 156; RR = 1.25, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.46; P = 0.006). No serious adverse events were reported. CONCLUSION: Wet cupping may be as effective as treatment with antihistamines. When cupping therapy is used as an adjuvant therapy to antihistamines or acupuncture, it may enhance the efficacy. Results drawn from these studies should be interpreted with caution and applied with care to clinical practice, because of the poor quality among the studies that were reviewed.

#2213,Dry needling and exercise for chronic whiplash - a randomised controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Chronic whiplash is a common and costly problem. Sensory hypersensitivity is a feature of chronic whiplash that is associated with poor responsiveness to physical treatments such as exercise. Modalities such as dry-needling have shown some capacity to modulate sensory hypersensitivity, suggesting that when combined with advice and exercise, such an approach may be more effective in the management of chronic whiplash. The primary aim of this project is to investigate the effectiveness of dry-needling, advice and exercise for chronic whiplash. METHOD/DESIGN: A double-blind randomised controlled trial will be conducted. 120 participants with chronic whiplash, grade II will be randomised to receive either 1) dry-needling, advice and exercise or 2) sham dry-needling, advice and exercise. All participants will receive an educational booklet on whiplash. Participants who are randomised to Group 1 will receive 6 treatments of combined dry-needling and exercise delivered in the first 3 weeks of the 6 week program, and 4 treatments of exercise only in the last 3 weeks of the program. Participants randomised to Group 2 will receive an identical protocol, except that a sham dry-needling technique will be used instead of dry-needling. The primary outcome measures are the Neck Disability Index (NDI) and participants' perceived recovery. Outcomes will be measured at 6, 12, 24 and 52 weeks after randomization by an assessor who is blind to the group allocation of the participants. In parallel, an economic analysis will be conducted. DISCUSSION: This trial will utilise high quality trial methodologies in accordance with CONSORT guidelines. The successful completion of this trial will provide evidence of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a combined treatment approach for the management of chronic whiplash.

#2225,Double-blinding of an acupuncture randomized controlled trial optimized with clinical translational science award resources,"BACKGROUND: Clinical trial articles often lack detailed descriptions of the methods used to randomize participants, conceal allocation, and blind subjects and investigators to group assignment. We describe our systematic approach to implement and measure blinding success in a double-blind phase 2 randomized controlled trial testing the efficacy of acupuncture for the treatment of vulvodynia. METHODS: Randomization stratified by vulvodynia subtype is managed by Research Electronic Data Capture software's randomization module adapted to achieve complete masking of group allocation. Subject and acupuncturist blinding assessments are conducted multiple times to identify possible correlates of unblinding. RESULTS: At present, 48 subjects have been randomized and completed the protocol resulting in 87 subject and 206 acupuncturist blinding assessments. DISCUSSION: Our approach to blinding and blinding assessment has the potential to improve our understanding of unblinding over time in the presence of possible clinical improvement."
#2266,Does acupuncture have a place as an adjunct treatment during pregnancy? A review of randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews,"BACKGROUND: Complementary medicine has become popular throughout many Western countries and is widely used by women across all stages of their life cycle. Acupuncture is used by women during their pregnancy, and research suggests that acupuncture may be used as an adjunct to their existing conventional care. The aim of this paper was to summarize the evidence examining the effectiveness of acupuncture during pregnancy and birthing, and to discuss its role as an adjunct treatment. METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature search using several electronic databases. We included all placebo-controlled randomized trials of parallel design, and systematic reviews that evaluated the role of acupuncture during pregnancy and birthing. A critical appraisal of clinical trials and systematic reviews was undertaken. RESULTS: The summarized findings indicated a small but growing body of acupuncture research, with some evidence suggesting a benefit from acupuncture to treat nausea in pregnancy. Findings from the review also highlighted promising evidence for the effectiveness of acupuncture to manage back and pelvic pain, acupuncture-type interventions to induce change in breech presentation, and pain relief in labor. The methodological quality of recent trials has improved, and the quality of systematic reviews was high. CONCLUSIONS: Interest is growing in the use of acupuncture to treat some complaints during pregnancy and childbirth, and evidence is beginning to consolidate that acupuncture may assist with the management of some complaints during pregnancy. However, definitive conclusions about its effectiveness cannot be reached and further research is justified."
#2286,Effects of Traditional Chinese Medicine Acupoint Massage and Acupoint Application on Defecation Status and Quality of Life in Patients with Constipation and Psychogenic Drug-Induced Heat,"BACKGROUND: Constipation is a prevalent adverse drug reaction during the treatment of mental illnesses. Traditional Chinese medicine boasts substantial expertise in addressing constipation. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of traditional Chinese medicine acupoint massage combined with acupoint application on the quality of life of patients experiencing solid heat constipation induced by psychogenic drugs. DESIGN: This study employed a randomized controlled design. SETTING: This study was conducted at the Seventh People's Hospital of Hangzhou. PARTICIPANTS: Between May 2019 and August 2020, 150 hospitalized patients from the Department of Psychiatry at the Seventh People's Hospital of Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, were selected through convenience sampling. The clinical diagnosis type was intestinal solid fever. The patients were divided into three groups using a random number table method: observation group, intervention group 1, and intervention group 2, each consisting of 50 cases. INTERVENTIONS: The observation group underwent acupoint massage combined with application treatment. Intervention group 1 received an acupoint massage. Intervention group 2 underwent Shenque acupoint application treatment. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: (1) Defecation characteristics; (2) Defecation difficulty scores; and (3) Quality of life of patients. RESULTS: The observation group exhibited superior improvement in Bristol constipation stool character and defecation difficulty compared to intervention group 1 and intervention group 2 (P < .05 and P < .01). In the quality-of-life assessment scale, the observation group outperformed intervention group 1 and intervention group 2 in physical, psychological, worry, and satisfaction aspects (P < .05 and P < .01). CONCLUSIONS: Traditional Chinese medicine acupoint massage combined with acupoint application demonstrates significant effects on constipation characteristics, defecation difficulties, and the overall quality of life of patients. These findings merit consideration for clinical application."
#2313,Corticosteroid injection or dry needling for musculoskeletal pain and disability? A systematic review and GRADE evidence synthesis,"BACKGROUND: Corticosteroid injection and dry needling have been used in the treatment of musculoskeletal conditions, but it is unclear which intervention is the most effective. The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of corticosteroid injection and dry needling for musculoskeletal conditions at short-, medium-, and long-term follow-up. METHODS: Electronic databases were searched up to 31 October 2021. Two researchers independently screened titles, abstracts and full-text articles. Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that investigated the effectiveness of dry needling compared to corticosteroid injection in patients over 18 years with a musculoskeletal condition were included in the review. The studies had to report pain and/or disability as outcome. Risk of bias was assessed by using the revised Cochrane Collaboration tool (RoB 2.0). Quality of evidence was evaluated by using the GRADE approach. RESULTS: Six studies were included (n = 384 participants). Four musculoskeletal conditions were investigated. There is very low-quality evidence that CSI is superior to DN for reducing heel pain (plantar fasciitis) and lateral elbow pain at short- and medium-term follow-up, but not for myofascial pain and greater trochanteric pain. There is very low-quality evidence that DN is more effective than CSI at long-term follow-up for reducing pain in people with plantar fasciitis and lateral epicondylitis. Very low-certainty evidence shows that there is no difference between DN and CSI for disability at short-term follow-up. One study showed that CSI is superior to DN at medium-term follow-up and another observed that DN is superior to CSI for reducing disability at long-term. CONCLUSIONS: There are no differences between DN and CSI in pain or disability for myofascial pain and greater trochanteric pain syndrome. Very-low certainty evidence suggests that CSI is superior to DN at shorter follow-up periods, whereas DN seems to be more effective than CSI at longer follow-up durations for improving pain in plantar fasciitis and lateral epicondylitis. Large RCTs with higher methodological quality are needed in order to draw more incisive conclusions. PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42020148650."
#2339,Different acupuncture and moxibustion therapies in the treatment of IBS-D with anxiety and depression: A network meta-analysis,"BACKGROUND: Currently, a variety of Western medical interventions are available for the treatment of diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) with comorbid anxiety and depression. However, the attendant negative effects also emerge, putting pressure on healthcare resources and socio-economic structures. In recent years, the benefits of acupuncture (ACU) and moxibustion in the treatment of IBS-D with anxiety and depression have gradually emerged. However, there are many types of ACU-moxibustion-related treatments, and the aim of this study is to examine the effectiveness of different ACU-moxibustion therapies in the treatment of anxiety and depression in IBS-D patients. METHODS: Searched and identified randomized controlled trials (RCTS) of ACU for the treatment of anxiety and depression in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The search spanned from the establishment of the database until September 1, 2023. Revman 5.4 and Stata 15.0 software were used for network meta-analysis (NMA), and the included interventions were ranked by the area under the cumulative ranking curve. RESULTS: A total of 26 articles involving 8 interventions were included. In terms of improving HAMA score, MOX was superior to EA, combined therapies, CH, WM and placebo; In terms of improving HAMD score, MOX was superior to ACU, EA, combined therapies, WM and placebo; In terms of improving the SAS score, The combined therapies were superior to EA, CH and WM; In terms of improving SDS scores, The combined therapies were superior to EA, CH and WM; In terms of improving IBS-SSS score, The combined therapies were superior to WM; In terms of reducing recurrence rates, CH was superior to combined therapies; In terms of improving total effective rates, MOX was superior to EA, CH, WM and placebo; MOX, combined therapies, ACU and EA ranked higher in SUCRA of different outcome indicators. CONCLUSION: MOX, combined therapies, ACU and EA have certain curative effect on anxiety and depression in patients with IBS-D, and their safety is high. ACU and MOX combined with other therapies also have significant advantages in the treatment effect."
#2378,Acupuncture for vascular dementia,"BACKGROUND: Dementia is a widespread condition characterized by acquired global impairment of intellect, memory and personality, but with no impairment of consciousness. There is no definitive medical or surgical treatment for vascular dementia. Acupuncture is an ancient Chinese method which has been used for both the prevention and treatment of diseases for over three thousand years. Preliminary searches revealed more than 105 studies of acupuncture for treating vascular dementia. Benefit was reported in up to 70-91% of the treatment group. Body acupuncture and electroacupuncture were the most commonly used techniques. A comparison of electroacupuncture and acupuncture therapy alone suggested that the former was more effective in promoting the recovery of cognitive function. OBJECTIVES: The objective is to assess the efficacy and possible adverse effects of acupuncture therapy for treating vascular dementia. SEARCH STRATEGY: The trials were identified from a search of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement group's Specialized Register on 2 February 2007 which contains records from all major health care databases and many ongoing trials databases. In addition the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database was searched and the web was searched using the search engine Copernic. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials testing acupuncture therapy in the treatment of vascular dementia were included regardless of language and publication types. The intervention and control group had to receive identical treatment apart from the acupuncture intervention. In view of possible confounding, studies in which acupuncture was combined with other treatments were subjected to subgroup analyses. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Titles and abstracts identified from the searches were checked by two reviewers. If it was clear that the study did not refer to a randomized controlled trial in vascular dementia, it was excluded. If it was not clear from the abstract and title, then the full text of study was obtained for an independent assessment by two reviewers. The outcomes measured in clinical trials of dementia and cognitive impairment often arise from ordinal rating scales. Summary statistics were required for each rating scale at each assessment time for each treatment group in each trial for change from baseline. MAIN RESULTS: In the absence of any suitable randomised placebo-controlled trials in this area, we were unable to perform a meta-analysis. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The effectiveness of acupuncture for vascular dementia is uncertain. More evidence is required to show that vascular dementia can be treated effectively by acupuncture. There are no RCTs and high quality trials are few. Randomised double-blind placebo controlled trials are urgently needed."
#2463,Effects of herb-partitioned moxibustion for diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome: A protocol for systematic review and meta-analysis,"BACKGROUND: Diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) is a common functional intestinal disease characterized by abdominal pain and diarrhea. Herb-partitioned moxibustion (HPM), a characteristic external therapy, is effective in treating IBS-D. However, no systematic review has been carried out to assess the efficacy and safety of HPM for IBS-D. The aim of this study will systematically evaluate the efficacy and safety of HPM for the treatment of patients with IBS-D. METHODS: We will perform the comprehensive literature search in both English and Chinese electronic database including PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science database, Medline, Chinese BioMedical Literature Database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang database, Chongqing VIP information, and SinoMed from their inception to July 2020. All randomized controlled trials of HPM for the treatment of IBS-D will be included. RevManV5. 3 will be applied to analyze the data. RESULTS: This study will provide high-quality synthesis of current evidence of effectiveness and safety on HPM for patients with IBS-D. CONCLUSION: The conclusion of our systematic review will provide evidence to judge whether HPM is an effective intervention for IBS-D. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: 10.17605/OSF.IO/3JXCZ."
#2470,Visual field defects in normal-tension and high-tension glaucoma,"BACKGROUND: Differences in visual field characteristics between normal-tension glaucoma (NTG) and high-tension glaucoma (HTG) have not been established. This study re-examined the problem by pointwise between-group comparison of data obtained with the Humphrey 30-2 program. METHODS: Sixty-eight NTG cases with maximum intraocular pressure (IOP) of 21 mmHg or lower and 62 HTG cases with maximum IOP of 25 mmHg or greater with a mean deviation (STATPAC) greater than -10 decibels (dB) were included. Age, refraction, mean deviation, or sex ratio were matched between the two groups. Total deviation (STATPAC), the difference between the measured threshold and the age-corrected normal reference at each test point of the 30-2 program, was used for pointwise between-group comparisons. Another parameter, total deviation - mean total deviation, was introduced to normalize the total deviation by the overall visual field damage as an index of disease stage. Mean total deviation is the average of total deviations across the test field. Further, logistic discriminant analysis was applied to confirm that the difference at a questioned test point was due to the difference of disease type, but not disease stage, between the two groups. RESULTS: Comparison using total deviation and total deviation - mean total deviation gave similar results, which were collaborated by logistic discriminant analysis. For a given amount of visual field damage, an area just above the horizontal meridian was significantly more depressed in NTG, while HTG had significantly more diffuse visual field damage. CONCLUSION: Visual field defect of NTG differs from that of HTG, which may suggest that different regions of the optic disc are more susceptible to damage in NTG."
#2504,Electroacupuncture Enhances Gastric Accommodation via the Autonomic and Cytokine Mechanisms in Functional Dyspepsia,"BACKGROUND: Due to complex pathophysiology of functional dyspepsia, medications to treat functional dyspepsia are not effective for all patients. Transcutaneous electrical acustimulation (TEA) is an potentially effective therapy for functional dyspepsia without proofs of definite mechanisms. AIMS: We aimed to investigate the therapeutic impacts of TEA on postprandial distress syndrome (PDS) and explore potential neuroimmune mechanisms. METHODS: We conducted a double-blinded, randomized, controlled trial in 30 PDS patients randomized for 4-week TEA or sham-TEA. Dyspeptic symptoms, gastric accommodation, gastric emptying and heart rate variability (HRV) were assessed. Duodenal mucosal inflammation was also evaluated. RESULTS: The dyspeptic symptoms were improved with TEA compared with sham-TEA (P = 0.03). The initial satiety volume and the maximum tolerable volume (MTV) were both improved after the TEA treatment, compared with the sham-TEA group (P all < 0.05). The gastric emptying time (T1/2) was not altered with TEA or sham-TEA. The TEA treatment increased vagal activity and decreased sympathovagal ratio assessed by HRV (P all < 0.01). The IL-6 expression in bulb mucosa was downregulated by the TEA treatment compared to the baseline (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Noninvasive TEA improves gastric accommodation and dyspeptic symptoms, possibly by downregulating the IL-6 expression in duodenal bulb mucosa via the vagal efferent pathway."
#2507,Auriculotherapy to control chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in patients with cancer: protocol of a systematic review,"BACKGROUND: Due to the worldwide rise in cancer incidence, and therefore the rise in the need for antineoplastic chemotherapy, it is important for both healthcare professionals and patients alike that the side effects of chemotherapy, such as chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), are treated and prevented. Auriculotherapy is a type of acupuncture and may be a low-cost and safe antiemetic measure to control the side effects of chemotherapy. The goal of this systematic review is to synthesize the available evidence in the literature regarding the auriculotherapy effects to treat CINV in people with cancer. METHODS: The review will only include randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compare the clinical effects of the auriculotherapy intervention (used alone or as an add-on), with sham auriculotherapy, routine treatment with antiemetic drugs, or other non-pharmacological interventions in patients with cancer with CINV who are undergoing chemotherapy. The outcomes to be evaluated are nausea and vomiting: in acute, delayed, or anticipated stages, when induced by chemotherapy. A comprehensive search for studies will be carried out in these databases: MEDLINE via PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, ICTRP, LILACS, CUMED, IBECS, BVS MTCI Americas, Web of Science, Scopus, PEDro, CNKI, and CBMdisc up until December 31, 2018. Only articles in English, Portuguese, and Spanish will be selected. Two independent reviewers will evaluate full texts, extract data, and assess the risk of bias of eligible articles. The quality of evidence will be assessed using Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE). A meta-analysis will be undertaken to assess the interventions and outcomes' homogeneity, assessing statistical heterogeneity using the Cochran's Q test and quantified using Higgins' inconsistency index. If there is insufficient data for a meta-analysis, a narrative synthesis will be presented. This protocol has been prepared according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) guidelines. DISCUSSION: The results of this systematic review will summarize the strength of evidence for the use of auriculotherapy in the control of CINV of patients with cancer and will be used to identify evidence gaps.

#2511,"Interventions for dysarthria due to stroke and other adult-acquired, non-progressive brain injury","BACKGROUND: Dysarthria is an acquired speech disorder following neurological injury that reduces intelligibility of speech due to weak, imprecise, slow and/or unco-ordinated muscle control. The impact of dysarthria goes beyond communication and affects psychosocial functioning. This is an update of a review previously published in 2005. The scope has been broadened to include additional interventions, and the title amended accordingly. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of interventions to improve dysarthric speech following stroke and other non-progressive adult-acquired brain injury such as trauma, infection, tumour and surgery. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (May 2016), CENTRAL (Cochrane Library 2016, Issue 4), MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL on 6 May 2016. We also searched Linguistics and Language Behavioral Abstracts (LLBA) (1976 to November 2016) and PsycINFO (1800 to September 2016). To identify further published, unpublished and ongoing trials, we searched major trials registers: WHO ICTRP, the ISRCTN registry, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also handsearched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted academic institutions and other researchers regarding other published, unpublished or ongoing trials. We did not impose any language restrictions. SELECTION CRITERIA: We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing dysarthria interventions with 1) no intervention, 2) another intervention for dysarthria (this intervention may differ in methodology, timing of delivery, duration, frequency or theory), or 3) an attention control. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Three review authors selected trials for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We attempted to contact study authors for clarification and missing data as required. We calculated standardised mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI), using a random-effects model, and performed sensitivity analyses to assess the influence of methodological quality. We planned to conduct subgroup analyses for underlying clinical conditions. MAIN RESULTS: We included five small trials that randomised a total of 234 participants. Two studies were assessed as low risk of bias; none of the included studies were adequately powered. Two studies used an attention control and three studies compared to an alternative intervention, which in all cases was one intervention versus usual care intervention. The searches we carried out did not find any trials comparing an intervention with no intervention. The searches did not find any trials of an intervention that compared variations in timing, dose, or intensity of treatment using the same intervention. Four studies included only people with stroke; one included mostly people with stroke, but also those with brain injury. Three studies delivered interventions in the first few months after stroke; two recruited people with chronic dysarthria. Three studies evaluated behavioural interventions, one investigated acupuncture and another transcranial magnetic stimulation. One study included people with dysarthria within a broader trial of people with impaired communication.Our primary analysis of a persisting (three to nine months post-intervention) effect at the activity level of measurement found no evidence in favour of dysarthria intervention compared with any control (SMD 0.18, 95% CI -0.18 to 0.55; 3 trials, 116 participants, GRADE: low quality, I² = 0%). Findings from sensitivity analysis of studies at low risk of bias were similar, with a slightly wider confidence interval and low heterogeneity (SMD 0.21, 95% CI -0.30 to 0.73, I² = 32%; 2 trials, 92 participants, GRADE: low quality). Subgroup analysis results for stroke were similar to the primary analysis because few non-stroke participants had been recruited to trials (SMD 0.16, 95% CI -0.23 to 0.54, I² = 0%; 3 trials, 106 participants, GRADE: low quality).Similar results emerged from most of the secondary analyses. There was no evidence of a persisting effect at the impairment (SMD 0.07, 95% CI -0.91 to 1.06, I² = 70%; 2 trials, 56 participants, GRADE: very low quality) or participation level (SMD -0.11, 95% CI -0.56 to 0.33, I² = 0%; 2 trials, 79 participants, GRADE: low quality) but substantial heterogeneity on the former. Analyses of immediate post-intervention outcomes provided no evidence of any short-term benefit on activity (SMD 0.29, 95% CI -0.07 to 0.66, I² = 0%; 3 trials, 117 participants, GRADE: very low quality); or participation (SMD -0.24, 95% CI -0.94 to 0.45; 1 study, 32 participants) levels of measurement.There was a statistically significant effect favouring intervention at the immediate, impairment level of measurement (SMD 0.47, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.92, P = 0.04, I² = 0%; 4 trials, 99 participants, GRADE: very low quality) but only one of these four trials had a low risk of bias. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We found no definitive, adequately powered RCTs of interventions for people with dysarthria. We found limited evidence to suggest there may be an immediate beneficial effect on impairment level measures; more, higher quality research is needed to confirm this finding.Although we evaluated five studies, the benefits and risks of interventions remain unknown and the emerging evidence justifies the need for adequately powered clinical trials into this condition.People with dysarthria after stroke or brain injury should continue to receive rehabilitation according to clinical guidelines."
#2567,Transcriptomic Insights Into Electroacupuncture Using Different Acupoint Combinations to Repair Mucosal Inflammatory Injury Induced in a Rat Model of Gastric Ulcer,"BACKGROUND: Electroacupuncture (EA) is a promising treatment for gastrointestinal disorders, yet the efficacy of different acupoint combinations remains mechanistically undefined. We evaluated the therapeutic effects of different acupoint combinations on mucosal inflammatory injury induced in a rat model of gastric ulcer (GU) and dissected its molecular mechanisms through transcriptomic profiling. METHODS: A GU rat model was established using hypothermic restrained water immersion stress. EA therapy was administered to the He-Mu (ST36-CV12), Shu-Mu (BL21-CV12), and Yuan-Luo (ST42- ST40) acupoint combinations for 5 days. EA therapeutic effects were evaluated by coat score, fecal moisture percentage, pain threshold, body mass, organ index, histopathological changes, serum level of oxidative stress, and inflammatory cytokine levels in gastric tissue. A transcriptome analysis identified the related differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and central signaling pathway. Real-time quantitative PCR and Western blot were performed to verify the mRNA and protein expression levels of the main genes in the central pathway. RESULTS: EA using different acupoint combinations differentially alleviated gastric mucosal injury in GU rats, with the He-Mu group exhibiting superior tissue damage alleviation, as well as inflammation and oxidative stress reductions. A Venn diagram transcriptome analysis revealed a shared central pathway among the three groups, corresponding to focal adhesion. Quantitative validation confirmed that the mRNA, protein, and phosphorylated protein expression of FAK, VCL, and EGFR-the core signal transduction factors of the focal adhesion pathway activated in gastric tissue after EA treatment-were upregulated, consistent with their therapeutic efficacy. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated that the He-Mu acupoint combination exhibited superior therapeutic efficacy among the three acupoint combinations. EA using different acupoint combinations improved gastric mucosal injury to varying degrees, and was related to the focal adhesion pathway. The FAK, VCL, and EGFR are promising targets, and further studies are needed to elucidate their functional consequences in GU."
#2757,Acupuncture as add-on treatment for functional dyspepsia: A protocol for systematic review,"BACKGROUND: Functional dyspepsia (FD) is a common functional gastrointestinal disease with a high prevalence. However, due to the limitations of conventional Western treatments, such as acid suppressants, prokinetics, Helicobacter pylori eradication treatment, and antidepressants, the popularity of complementary and alternative medicine, such as acupuncture, is steadily increasing. We describe the methods that will be used to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture as add-on therapies to conventional Western medications in patients with FD. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A total of 12 English, Korean, and Chinese electronic databases will be searched by 2 researchers from their inception dates to December 2020. Randomized controlled trials assessing the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture as add-on therapies to conventional Western medications in patients with FD will be included. The primary outcome measure will be the symptom score of FD, and secondary outcome measures will be total effective rate, quality of life, level of gut peptide hormones, incidence of adverse events, and recurrence rate. Data analysis will be performed using the Review Manager version 5.3. The risk of bias of the included studies and the quality of evidence for the main findings will be evaluated using the Cochrane Collaborations risk of bias tool and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach, respectively. CONCLUSION: The findings of this review will provide evidence on the complementary effectiveness and safety of acupuncture for FD for clinicians, patients, and policy makers in decision making.

#2758,Electroacupuncture for the treatment of functional dyspepsia: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"BACKGROUND: Functional dyspepsia (FD) is a common functional gastrointestinal disease. Acupuncture, including electroacupuncture (EA) is widely used as a complementary and alternative treatment for patients with FD. This study aimed to explore the effectiveness of EA for the treatment of FD. METHODS: We searched Embase, PubMed, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Cochrane Library) for randomized controlled trials of FD treated by EA from inception to February 3, 2020. Two reviewers will independently screen studies for data extraction and assess the quality and risk of bias. The Cochrane Collaboration's risk of bias tool, RevMan 5.3 software were used for meta-analysis. Data were pooled to calculate relative risk and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of substantial improvement after treatment for dichotomous data and mean differences (SMDs) and 95% CIs for continuous data. RESULTS: Seven randomized clinical trials included 853 patients. This meta-analysis investigated the effectiveness of EA alone in the treatment of FD relative to sham-EA or pharmacologic medication (PM). The results showed that EA could significantly improve clinical symptoms. Compared with sham-EA, EA was more effective in reducing symptom scores (SMD -3.44, 95% CI -4.21 to -2.67) and increasing normal slow waves of electrogastrogram (SMD 0.93, 95% CI -0.30 to1.55). When EA was combined with PM, there was no significant difference in reducing symptom scores (SMD -0.18, 95% CI -0.51 to 0.16), increasing the effective rate of clinical symptoms (risk ratio 1.04, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.13), enhancing the level of plasma motilin (SMD 0.93, 95% CI -0.30 to1.55), and reducing gastric half-emptying time (SMD 0.02, 95% CI -0.16 to 0.20). The results also showed that there were very few adverse events reported. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis suggests that EA is better than the placebo (sham-EA) in treating FD, and the therapeutic effect of EA on FD is equivalent to that of PM on FD. Compared with PM, EA for FD is safer and has fewer adverse reactions. Despite limitations due to the quality and number of the included studies, EA might be used as an effective and safe treatment for FD."
#2888,Non-hormonal interventions for hot flushes in women with a history of breast cancer,"BACKGROUND: Hot flushes are common in women with a history of breast cancer. Hormonal therapies are known to reduce these symptoms but are not recommended in women with a history of breast cancer due to their potential adverse effects. The efficacy of non-hormonal therapies is still uncertain. OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy of non-hormonal therapies in reducing hot flushes in women with a history of breast cancer. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, CINAHL, PsycINFO (August 2008) and WHO ICTRP Search Portal. We handsearched reference lists of reviews and included articles, reviewed conference proceedings and contacted experts. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing non-hormonal therapies with placebo or no therapy for reducing hot flushes in women with a history of breast cancer. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently selected potentially relevant studies, decided upon their inclusion and extracted data on participant characteristics, interventions, outcomes and the risk of bias of included studies. MAIN RESULTS: Sixteen RCTs met our inclusion criteria. We included six studies on selective serotonin (SSRI) and serotonin-norepinephrine (SNRI) reuptake inhibitors, two on clonidine, one on gabapentin, two each on relaxation therapy and homeopathy, and one each on vitamin E, magnetic devices and acupuncture. The risk of bias of most studies was rated as low or moderate. Data on continuous outcomes were presented inconsistently among studies, which precluded the possibility of pooling the results. Three pharmacological treatments (SSRIs and SNRIs, clonidine and gabapentin) reduced the number and severity of hot flushes. One study assessing vitamin E did not show any beneficial effect. One of two studies on relaxation therapy showed a significant benefit. None of the other non-pharmacological therapies had a significant benefit. Side-effects were inconsistently reported. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Clonidine, SSRIs and SNRIs, gabapentin and relaxation therapy showed a mild to moderate effect on reducing hot flushes in women with a history of breast cancer."
#2907,Effect of Integrated Yoga and Naturopathy Treatments on Blood Pressure Changes Among Patients with Hypertension: A Retrospective Data Analysis,"BACKGROUND: Hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, requiring effective management strategies. While pharmacological treatment remains the cornerstone, non-pharmacological interventions such as yoga and naturopathy are promising in blood pressure regulation. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of integrated yoga and naturopathy therapies (INYTs) in managing blood pressure and cardiovascular parameters among hypertensive patients. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study analyzed inpatient medical records from January to December 2018 at the Government Yoga and Naturopathy Medical College and Hospital. 281 hypertensive patients were allocated to two groups: patients receiving antihypertensive medication (n = 156) and those without medication (n = 125). INTERVENTIONS: All participants received a standardized 15-day individualized and group INYT sessions, including yoga practices (asana, pranayama, meditation), naturopathy-based hydrotherapy, mud therapy, massage, acupuncture, and dietary interventions. MAIN OUTCOMES: Primary outcomes included changes in systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), heart rate (HR), pulse pressure (PP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), rate pressure product (RPP), and double product (DoP) measured before and after the intervention. RESULTS: Both groups demonstrated significant reductions (P < .05) in SBP, DBP, HR, PP, MAP, RPP, and DoP following the intervention. Hypertensive patients without medication exhibited a greater reduction in SBP (142.1 ± 11.9 mmHg to 129.8 ± 14.7 mmHg) and DBP (86.4 ± 9.4 mmHg to 76.5 ± 6.5 mmHg) than those on medication (SBP: 126.2 ± 3.5 mmHg to 118.7 ± 2.4 mmHg; DBP: 74.5 ± 4.2 mmHg to 66.5 ± 9.0 mmHg). The intergroup analysis confirmed a significantly greater improvement in the non-medication group (P < .01). CONCLUSIONS: INYTs were associated with significant improvements in blood pressure and cardiovascular parameters in hypertensive patients. The greater magnitude of improvement observed in the non-medication group suggests potential benefits of INYTs as an adjunct to conventional management."
#2980,A novel taping therapy for pain after arthroscopic shoulder surgery: study protocol for a randomised controlled pilot trial,"BACKGROUND: In recent years, the number of arthroscopic shoulder surgeries has increased given that the intervention is minimally invasive. However, postoperative pain is one of the most common symptoms of patients who undergo arthroscopic surgery. Although pharmacological treatments and brachial plexus blocks for reducing pain are currently used, the adherence rate of interventions is low, and adverse effects often occur. Chimsband, made up of silver and optic fibres, is a novel taping therapy that stimulates patients' acupoints and is expected to relieve pain with few adverse effects. The aim of this study is to explore the effectiveness of Chimsband to relieve pain following arthroscopic shoulder surgery. METHODS/DESIGN: This is a randomised, parallel, controlled, exploratory clinical trial. Thirty participants who undergo arthroscopic shoulder surgery will be randomly allocated to an intervention or a control group. Both groups will receive 10 sessions of interferential current therapy within a period of 2 weeks, while the intervention group will additionally receive taping therapy after undergoing physical therapy. Two follow-up visits will be scheduled after the last treatment session. The primary outcome variable will be the difference in the visual analogue scale (VAS) scores between baseline and first follow-up evaluation after the end of 10 treatment sessions. The secondary outcomes will be VAS at the end of the second week, shoulder pain and disability index, range of motion, VAS while sleeping, questionnaire of blood stasis pattern identification at two follow-up visits, and number of bands used per visit. Outcomes will be evaluated at baseline, 2 weeks from visit 1 (+ within 6 days) after commencement, and at 4 weeks from visit 1 (+ within 6 days) follow-up. DISCUSSION: This study will be the first clinical trial to explore the effect and safety of Chimsband on postoperative shoulder pain. It would provide clinical evidence to conduct further taping therapy studies for relieving musculoskeletal pain. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Korean Clinical Trial Registry, KCT0002355 .

#2986,A PET-CT study on the specificity of acupoints through acupuncture treatment in migraine patients,"BACKGROUND: In the field of acupuncture research, the topic of acupoint specificity has received increasing attention, but no unified conclusion has been reached on whether or not acupoint specificity exists. Furthermore, the majority of previous acupuncture neuroimaging studies have been performed using healthy subjects. In this study, patients with migraine were used to investigate acupoint specificity. METHODS: Thirty patients with migraine were enrolled and randomized into three groups: Traditional Acupuncture Group (TAG), Control Acupuncture Group (CAG), and Migraine Group (MG). The TAG was treated by acupuncture stimulation at Waiguan (TE5), Yang Lingquan (GB34), and Fengchi (GB20). The CAG was treated at Touwei (ST8), Pianli (LI6), and Zusanli (ST36). The MG received no treatment. Positron emission tomography with computed tomography (PET-CT) was used to test for differences in brain activation between the TAG and CAG versus MG, respectively. RESULTS: Traditional acupuncture treatment was more effective for pain reduction than control acupuncture treatment. The TAG showed higher brain metabolism than the MG in the middle temporal cortex (MTC), orbital frontal cortex (OFC), insula, middle frontal gyrus, angular gyrus, post-cingulate cortex (PCC), the precuneus, and the middle cingulate cortex (MCC). Metabolism decreased in the parahippocampus, hippocampus, fusiform gyrus, postcentral gyrus, and cerebellum in the TAG compared with the MG. In the CAG, metabolism increased compared with the MG in the MTC, supratemporal gyrus, supramarginal gyrus, and MCC, whereas metabolism decreased in the cerebellum. CONCLUSIONS: Acupuncture stimulation of different points on similar body regions in migraine patients reduced pain and induced different levels of cerebral glucose metabolism in pain-related brain regions. These findings may support the functional specificity of migraine- treatment-related acupoint. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The number of our clinical trial registration is: ChiCTR-TRC-11001813, and the protocol and inclusion criteria have already been registered as ChiCTR-TRC-11001813."
#3004,Analysis of factors related to chronic cough after lung cancer surgery,"BACKGROUND: In this study, we investigated the relationship between chronic cough and clinicopathological features in postoperative patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and evaluated the effectiveness of acupuncture therapy for the treatment of postoperative chronic cough in patients with NSCLC. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 171 patients with NSCLC who received lobectomy at our center between September 2017 and February 2018. The Mandarin Chinese version of the Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ-MC) was used to evaluate the degree of cough in patients. Postoperative cough was assessed by a visual analog scale (VAS). RESULTS: The total LCQ-MC score for the whole group was 19.79 ± 0.53 before surgery and 18.40 ± 0.70 after surgery (p < 0.001). Logistic regression analysis showed that right lung cancer, difficult airway, acute cough and history of COPD were independent predictors of chronic cough. Of the 68 patients diagnosed with chronic cough, 41 received acupuncture therapy (acupuncture therapy group), and 27 received no acupuncture therapy (no therapy group). No significant difference was found between the two groups in terms of their LCQ-MC scores at eight weeks after surgery (p = 0.756). However, the acupuncture therapy group had a significantly higher LCQ-MC score than the no therapy group at 10 weeks after surgery (p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Right lung cancer, difficult airway, acute cough, and history of COPD are independent predictors of chronic cough after surgery. For patients with chronic cough, acupuncture therapy can shorten the recovery time and improve quality of life after surgery."
#3008,"Introducing a computer-assisted, digital tongue-imaging device for standardization of traditional tongue diagnosis","BACKGROUND: In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) tongue diagnosis and pulse diagnosis are the major diagnostic methods up till now. As western research has tended to focus on acupuncture, attempts to standardize the classic diagnostic methods have been few. METHODS: A digital camera with a ring flash was fixed in a frame, so that the tongue-lens-distance and illumination were kept constant. A pilot study testing the inter-methods reliability, test-retest reliability, and interrater reliability of 2 observers was conducted: the tongues (1 ×) as well as the tongue images (2 ×) from 76 patients from our ward were assessed with a standardized rating list in a randomized order by both observers, who were mutually blinded. As primary outcome measure we used agreement beyond chance (Cohen's kappa). RESULTS: The colors of the tongue body / the tongue coating were the main criteria for the authentic reproduction of the tongue in our images. Inter-methods reliability for the color of the tongue body/coating was kappa 0.35 / 0.34 (p < 0.001) for observer 1 and 0.59 / 0.57 (p < 0.001) for observer 2. Test-retest reliability for the color of the tongue body / the tongue coating was kappa 0.53 / 0.48 (p< 0.001) for observer 1 and 0.65 / 0.62 (p < 0.001) for observer 2. Interrater reliability was generally low. CONCLUSIONS: The introduced device represents a first step towards standardization of tongue diagnosis. However, inter-methods as well as test-retest reliability vary between observers and different morphological characteristics."
#3035,Unsafe Practices Associated with HCV Infection Among Adults: A Case Control Study,"BACKGROUND: Infection with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) occurs globally. It is a substantial cause of chronic liver disease, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Egypt one the countries that has the highest hepatitis C burden in the world. The occurrence of HCV is directly related to the number of individuals who regularly share injection instruments and to the prevalence of inappropriate parenteral procedures in healthcare facilities. The study aimed to identify unhealthy community practices related to HCV infection. METHODS: a nested case control study carried out in Damietta Governorate, Egypt. Where150 cases (positive for HCV) and 300 controls (negative for HCV) were randomly chosen. RESULTS: Participant who shared shaving razor was 8.4times more likely to acquire HCV infection followed by IV fluid and needle or sharp stick (about six times more risk).while acupuncture, cupping, tattooing and traditional cauterization carried 1.6 to 3.6 timesmorerisk for HCV infection. CONCLUSIONS: Unhealthy community practices carried a higher risk for acquiring HCV infection. It is highly advocated to strengthen infection prevention and control program in health care facilities and health education programs to enhance community awareness and empowerment."
#3069,Acupuncture plus Tuina for chronic insomnia: A protocol of a systematic review and meta-analysis,"BACKGROUND: Insomnia is a common sleep disorder. It refers to a subjective feeling of dissatisfaction with sleep duration and quality that affects social functioning, even though there are appropriate opportunities and environments for sleep. The disease for a long time can easily cause physical and mental fatigue, anxiety, depression, and other symptoms. Anxiety, depression, and insomnia can worsen the condition. Acupuncture and Tuina therapy has been widely used in the treatment of chronic insomnia, and this study aimed to conduct a meta-analysis of acupuncture plus Tuina in the treatment of chronic insomnia to clarify its efficacy. METHODS: The following databases will be searched: Web of Science, PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and Medline databases. In addition, we will also collect 4 databases of China: China National Knowledge Infrastructure, China Biomedical Literature Database, VIP Database, and Wan-fang Database. We selected eligible studies published up to October 2021. We used Review Manager 5.4, provided by the Cochrane Collaborative Network for statistical analysis. Clinical randomized controlled trials related to acupuncture plus Tuina for chronic insomnia were included in this study. Language is limited to both Chinese and English languages. Study selection, data extraction, and study quality assessment were independently performed by 2 researchers. We then assessed the quality and risk of the included studies and observed the outcome indicators. RESULTS: This study provides a high-quality synthesis to assess the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture plus Tuina for treating chronic insomnia. CONCLUSION: This systematic review will provide evidence to determine whether acupuncture plus Tuina is an effective and safe intervention for patients with chronic insomnia. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The protocol of the systematic review does not require ethical approval because it does not involve humans. This article will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at relevant conferences. REGISTRATION NUMBER: INPLASY2021100115."
#3111,Clinical effectiveness and safety of acupuncture in the treatment of irradiation-induced xerostomia in patients with head and neck cancer: a systematic review,"BACKGROUND: Irradiation-induced xerostomia seriously reduces quality of life for patients with head and neck cancer (HNC). Anecdotal evidence suggests that acupuncture may be beneficial. OBJECTIVE: To systematically review evidence on clinical effectiveness and safety of acupuncture in irradiation-induced xerostomia in patients with HNC. METHODS: A detailed search was performed to identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews of RCTs on acupuncture in irradiation-induced xerostomia, using AMED, BNIA, CINAHL, Cochrane, Embase, HPSI, PsycInfo and Medline. Grey literature was explored and 11 journals hand searched. Search terms included: acupuncture, xerostomia, salivary hypofunction, hyposalivation, dry mouth, radiotherapy, irradiation, brachytherapy, external beam. Two authors independently extracted data for analysis using predefined selection criteria and quality indicators. RESULTS: 43 of the 61 articles identified were excluded on title/abstract. 18 articles underwent full-text review; three were deemed eligible for inclusion. Two trials had moderate risk of bias; one had high risk. Two trials compared acupuncture with sham acupuncture; one control arm received 'usual care'. Outcome measurements included salivary flow rates (SFRs) in two trials and subjective questionnaires in three. All three trials reported significant reduction in xerostomia versus baseline SFR (p<0.05); one reported greater effect in the intervention group for stimulated SFR (p<0.01). Subjective assessment reported significant differences between real acupuncture and control in two trials (p<0.02-0.05). Insufficient evidence was presented to undertake risk/benefit assessment. CONCLUSIONS: Limited evidence suggests that acupuncture is beneficial for irradiation-induced xerostomia. Although current evidence is insufficient to recommend this intervention, it is sufficient to justify further studies. Highlighted methodological limitations must be dealt with."
#3124,Comparison between the Effects of Acupuncture Relative to Other Controls on Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Meta-Analysis,"BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional gastrointestinal disorder with recurrent abdominal pain and altered defecation habits. We here attempted to determine the effect of acupuncture on IBS. METHODS: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in CNKI, VIP, Wanfang, PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Web of science, and ClinicalTrials.gov till July 17, 2019 were searched. Outcomes were total efficacy rates, overall IBS symptom scores, or global quality of life scores. Standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and risk ratio (RR) with 95% CI were calculated for meta-analysis. RESULTS: We included 41 RCTs involving 3440 participants for analysis. 8 RCTs compared acupuncture with sham acupuncture, among which 3 trials confirmed the biological effects of acupuncture, especially in treating abdominal pain, discomfort, and stool frequency. No significant difference was found when acupuncture was compared with sham acupuncture, in terms of effects on IBS symptoms and quality of life (SMD = 0.18, 95% CI -0.26∼0.63, P=0.42; SMD = -0.10, 95% CI -0.31∼0.11, P=0.35), but the pooled efficacy rate data showed a better outcome for true acupuncture (RR = 1.22, 95% CI 1.01∼1.47, P=0.04), which was not supported by sensitivity analysis. Acupuncture was more effective relative to western medicine in alleviating IBS symptoms (RR = 1.17, 95% CI 1.12∼1.23, I (2) = 0%, P < 0.00001), whose effect might last 3 months. Besides, acupuncture as an adjunct to western medicine, Chinese medications, or tuina was superior over the single latter treatment (RR = 1.68, 95% CI 1.18 to 2.40, P=0.004; 1.19, 1.03 to 1.36, P=0.02; 1.36, 1.08 to 1.72, P=0.009, respectively), with high heterogeneities. CONCLUSIONS: Relative to sham controls, acupuncture showed no superiority for treating IBS, while the advantage over western medicine was significant. Acupuncture could be used as an adjunct in clinical settings to improve efficacy. Future high-quality and large-sample-size studies with adequate quantity-effect design need to be conducted."
#3129,Comparison of acupuncture and pinaverium bromide in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome: A protocol for systematic review and meta-analysis,"BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common chronic gastrointestinal diseases, and the current diagnosis of IBS is still based on symptoms and examination. Pinaverium bromide is commonly used as an antispasmodic in the treatment of IBS. But adverse effects of pinaverium bromide are common. Meta-analyses show that acupuncture has a positive therapeutic effect on IBS. METHODS: Randomized controlled trials of comparing the efficacy of acupuncture and pinaverium bromide in the treatment of IBS will be searched in the relevant database: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Database, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), and Chinese Scientific Journal Database (VIP database). The studies selected will be exported to EndNote V.9.1 software. Data will be carried out independently from the selected articles by 2 reviewers. Any disagreement will be solved in consultation with a third reviewer. RESULTS: Our study aims to compare the efficacy of acupuncture and pinaverium bromide in the treatment of IBS and to fill the lack of relevant evidence. CONCLUSION: Through the inclusion of relevant literature, the overall efficacy of acupuncture and pinaverium bromide in the treatment of IBS will be evaluated, and the gap between various acupuncture treatment measures will be further analyzed.

#3201,Systematic Review and Network Meta-analysis of Acupuncture Combined with Massage in Treating Knee Osteoarthritis,"BACKGROUND: Knee osteoarthritis is a common clinical disease with frequent occurrence. More and more studies have shown that external therapies such as acupuncture and massage are beneficial to the treatment of knee osteoarthritis. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTS) was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of acupuncture and massage combined with treatment of KOA and to provide some reference for clinical treatment of KOA. METHODS: Network meta-analysis was used to evaluate the efficacy of acupuncture combined with massage in the treatment of knee osteoarthritis. PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Embase, Chinese Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), VIP, and Wanfang were searched by computer for randomized controlled trials on acupuncture combined with massage in the treatment of knee osteoarthritis. All researchers independently screened the literature, extracted data, and evaluated quality, and studies that met the quality criteria were analyzed using Stata16.0 software. RESULTS: A total of 3076 articles were retrieved, and finally, 49 studies involving 10 acupuncture combined with massage methods were included. The total sample size was 4458, including 2182 in the experimental group and 2276 in the control group. The results of network meta-analysis showed the following: in terms of effective rate, the optimal first three interventions were floating needle+massage, needle knife+massage, and silver needle+massage; in terms of reducing VAS score, the optimal first three interventions were common acupuncture+massage, needle knife+massage, and warm needle+massage; in terms of improving total Lysholm index score, the optimal first three interventions were silver needle+massage, electroacupuncture+massage, and needle knife+massage; in terms of reducing total WOMAC score, the optimal first three interventions were silver needle+massage, electrothermal needle+massage, and common acupuncture+massage; in terms of reducing WOMAC stiffness score, the optimal first three interventions were warm needle+massage, silver needle+massage, and common acupuncture+massage; and in terms of reducing WOMAC joint function score, the optimal first three interventions were silver needle+massage, warm needle+massage, and common acupuncture+massage. CONCLUSION: The results showed that acupuncture combined with massage could improve the clinical therapeutic effect of patients with knee osteoarthritis. Limited by the quality of the included studies, the conclusions obtained still need to be further validated."
#3207,Research on electroacupuncture parameters for knee osteoarthritis based on data mining,"BACKGROUND: Knee osteoarthritis, a common degenerative joint disease, has been widely treated by electroacupuncture in recent years. However, there are too many parameters of the treatment currently, resulting in various applications in clinical practice. This study aims to summarize the optimal stimulation parameters of electroacupuncture for knee osteoarthritis in clinical studies by applying data mining techniques. METHODS: Four databases including Pubmed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and Web of Science were searched for clinical studies on electroacupuncture treating knee osteoarthritis from 2012 to 2021. A database was established by Microsoft Excel 2020 and analyzed by R Version 4.1.1. RESULTS: Forty-six articles were included according to the established criteria. The most used electroacupuncture stimulation parameters were 0.30 mm × 40 mm needle, continuous wave, low frequency of current (mainly 2 Hz), stimulation duration for 30 min per treatment, and frequency of treatment for once a day. Eighteen acupoints were mentioned and the most used ones include Dubi (ST35), Liangqiu (ST34), Neixiyan (EX-LE4), Xuehai (SP10), Yanglingquan (GB34), and Yinlingquan (SP9), and those most generally used acupoints are closely arranged on the Stomach Channel of Foot Yangming. Cluster analysis showed two groups, one for obligatory acupoints and one for adjunctive ones. The association analysis showed the most supported acupoint pair was Liangqiu (ST34) and Xuehai (SP10). CONCLUSIONS: Continuous wave, low frequency of current (2 Hz), 30-min stimulation, and local acupoint selection are frequently used for electroacupuncture treating knee osteoarthritis. Due to the limitations of this study, further research and more standardized, multi-centered, and large-sample clinical trials should be conducted to provide more convincing evidence."
#3230,Acupuncture reduces peripheral and brainstem cytokines in rats subjected to lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation,"BACKGROUND: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) endotoxins are activators of innate immunity inducing infection and inflammatory responses. Anti-inflammatory drugs can have undesirable side effects. Acupuncture may be an alternative for the treatment of inflammatory processes. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the potential anti-inflammatory effect of manual acupuncture (MA) at SP6 upon LPS-induced peritonitis in rats. METHODS: Peritonitis was induced in rats with an intraperitoneal injection of LPS (0.002, 0.02, 0.2 or 2 µg/kg) in four experimental groups (n = 6 each). A fifth group was injected with sterile saline solution (saline group, n = 6). Four hours after the procedure, peritoneal fluid was collected to determine total cell counts for inflammatory cells, differential leukocyte counts and peritoneal capillary permeability. The LPS dose of 0.02 µg/kg was used in the subsequent experiments as it most successfully induced peritoneal inflammation. Subsequently, five experimental groups (n = 12 rats each) were used: (1) saline, (2) control (untreated LPS group), (3) indomethacin (LPS group treated with indomethacin), (4) NA (LPS group treated with MA at a location not corresponding to any traditional acupuncture point), and (5) SP6 (LPS group treated with verum MA at SP6). Ten minutes after MA or 30 min after indomethacin treatment, the rats received an intraperitoneal injection of LPS. After 4 h, total leukocyte and differential cell counts, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, vascular permeability and cytokine levels were evaluated in the peritoneal fluid. Cytokine levels were additionally evaluated in the brainstem. RESULTS: SP6 MA and indomethacin treatments reduced inflammatory cell infiltration, vascular permeability and MPO activity in the LPS-exposed rats. Pre-treatment with indomethacin and SP6 MA decreased tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α levels and preserved interleukin (IL)-10 in the peritoneal fluid. Indomethacin also reduced IL-6 in the peritoneal fluid. In the brainstem, indomethacin reduced IL-1β, IL-6, TNFα and IL-10, whereas SP6 MA reduced only TNFα and IL-6 levels. CONCLUSIONS: This study clearly demonstrates the anti-inflammatory effect of acupuncture, which we believe may involve the activation of anti-inflammatory neural reflexes in the regulation of peritonitis."
#3358,Type and frequency of side effects during PC6 acupuncture: observations from therapists and patients participating in clinical efficacy trials of acupuncture,"BACKGROUND: Many therapists practise PC6 acupuncture for emesis (nausea and vomiting) during pregnancy, different cancer therapies, palliative care, after surgery, or to induce relaxing effects in general. Knowledge of side effects is central to shared decision-making. AIM: To describe the type and frequency of side effects and the level of needle-induced pain during PC6 acupuncture. METHODS: We included 1298 PC6 acupuncture treatments, delivered to 221 participants (77% women, mean age 52.5, range 18-91 years). The subjects had received genuine PC6 acupuncture, in one of two previous randomised controlled trials, aimed at inducing antiemetic (n=100, with 100 providing data on side effects and 94 on needle-induced pain, respectively) or relaxing (n=121, with 120 providing data) effects. Side effects during and after the acupuncture treatments were registered in structured treatment protocols and study diaries. RESULTS: No serious complications occurred. Side effects during the acupuncture sessions included minor bleeding in 5.0%, tiredness in 4.9%, numbness in 4.5% and dizziness in 1.4% of the 1298 treatments. After treatment, the mean proportions of participants reporting side effects each week were: tiredness 25.8%; feeling cold 17.8%; dizziness 9.7%; sweating 9.3%; haematoma 8.8%; and soreness at the needling sites 4.3%. Participants perceived the needling to be not painful (47.4% of participants), or mildly (39.1%), moderately (11.6%) or very painful (1.4%). CONCLUSIONS: Few side effects occurred and those that did were mild. Nearly 90% found PC6 acupuncture to be not painful or only mildly painful. Healthcare professionals may consider the observed levels of side effects when informing patients about side effects of PC6 acupuncture."
#3371,Acupuncture for 'frequent attenders' with medically unexplained symptoms: a randomised controlled trial (CACTUS study),"BACKGROUND: Medically unexplained physical symptoms (MUPS) are common and difficult to treat. AIM: To investigate the effectiveness of adding five-element acupuncture to usual care in 'frequent attenders' with MUPS. DESIGN AND SETTING: Randomised controlled trial in four London general practices. METHOD: Participants were 80 adults with MUPS, consulting GPs ≥8 times/year. The intervention was individualised five-element acupuncture, ≥12 sessions, immediately (acupuncture group) and after 26 weeks (control group). The primary outcome was 26-week Measure Yourself Medical Outcome Profile (MYMOP); secondary outcomes were wellbeing (W-BQ12), EQ-5D, and GP consultation rate. Intention-to-treat analysis was used, adjusting for baseline outcomes. RESULTS: Participants (80% female, mean age 50 years, mixed ethnicity) had high health-resource use. Problems were 59% musculoskeletal; 65% >1 year duration. The 26-week questionnaire response rate was 89%. Compared to baseline, the mean 26-week MYMOP improved by 1.0 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.4 to 1.5) in the acupuncture group and 0.6 (95% CI = 0.3 to 0.9) in the control group (adjusted mean difference: acupuncture versus control -0.6 [95% CI = -1.1 to 0] P = 0.05). Other between-group adjusted mean differences were: W-BQ12 4.4 (95% CI = 1.6 to 7.2) P = 0.002; EQ-5D index 0.03 (95% CI = -0.11 to 0.16) P = 0.70; consultation rate ratio 0.90 (95% CI = 0.70 to 1.15) P = 0.4; and number of medications 0.56 (95% CI = 0.47 to 1.6) P = 0.28. All differences favoured the acupuncture group. Imputation for missing values reduced the MYMOP adjusted mean difference to -0.4 (95% CI = -0.9 to 0.1) P = 0.12. Improvements in MYMOP and W-BQ12 were maintained at 52 weeks. CONCLUSION: The addition of 12 sessions of five-element acupuncture to usual care resulted in improved health status and wellbeing that was sustained for 12 months."
#3462,Moxibustion inhibits inflammation in monosodium urate crystal-induced gouty arthritis model rats through metabolomic regulation,"BACKGROUND: Moxibustion is a form of therapy that to warm the acupoints located skin by using dried mugwort leaves. It is widely used to treat gouty arthritis (GA). However, the mechanism of moxibustion on improving GA has not been fully revealed. In this study, we explore the mechanism of moxibustion on GA via metabolomics combined with traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) theory. METHODS: Three days before model induction, the rats of moxibustion groups were treated with moxibustion in the ST36 and SP6, and then, a GA rat model induced by monosodium urate (MSU) was established. Biological samples, including joint synovial tissue and serum samples, were collected and measured by histopathological staining, molecular biology assays and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based metabolomics. RESULTS: We found that moxibustion could reduce the ankle edema induced by MSU crystals, decrease the expression of related proinflammatory genes, decrease the levels of serum IL-18 and IL-1β, and restore the metabolism of glycerol phospholipids, niacin and nicotinamide in GA model rats. CONCLUSION: Moxibustion can regulate the metabolism of GA model rats widely to inhibit inflammation. Our research deepens our understanding of the complex mechanisms of moxibustion and promotes the application of moxibustion in the clinical practice."
#3464,Moxibustion for hypertension: a systematic review,"BACKGROUND: Moxibustion is a traditional East Asian medical therapy that uses the heat generated by burning herbal preparations containing Artemisia vulgaris to stimulate acupuncture points. The aim of this review was to evaluate previously published clinical evidence for the use of moxibustion as a treatment for hypertension. METHODS: We searched 15 databases without language restrictions from their respective dates of inception until March 2010. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing moxibustion to either antihypertensive drugs or no treatment. The risk of bias was assessed for each RCT. RESULTS: During the course of our search, we identified 519 relevant articles. A total of 4 RCTs met all the inclusion criteria, two of which failed to report favorable effects of moxibustion on blood pressure (BP) compared to the control (antihypertensive drug treatment alone). However, a third RCT showed significant effects of moxibustion as an adjunct treatment to antihypertensive drug therapy for lowering BP compared to antihypertensive drug therapy alone. The fourth RCT included in this review addressed the immediate BP-lowering effects of moxibustion compared to no treatment. None of the included RCTs reported the sequence generation, allocation concealment and evaluator blinding. CONCLUSION: There is insufficient evidence to suggest that moxibustion is an effective treatment for hypertension. Rigorously designed trials are warranted to answer the many remaining questions."
#3468,Metabolomic analysis of biochemical changes in the tissue and urine of proteoglycan-induced spondylitis in mice after treatment with moxibustion,"BACKGROUND: Moxibustion is widely used in East Asian countries to manage the symptom of rheumatic diseases. The aim of this study was to identify potential metabolic profiles of moxibustion on relieving ankylosing spondylitis (AS) mice through UHPLC-Q-TOF/MS metabolomic study. METHODS: Thirty-two female Balb/c mice were randomized into healthy control (HC), AS model, moxibustion at acupuncture points (MA) in AS model, and moxibustion at non-acupuncture points (MNA) AS model groups. Moxibustion was administered daily at GV4, bilateral BL23 and bilateral ST36 acupuncture points for four weeks in the MA group. The overall health status, the thickness of hind paws and the tissue concentrations of IL-1β, PGE(2), IL-6 and TNF-α were assessed. The UHPLC-Q-TOF/MS was used to explore the perturbations of endogenous metabolites in tissue and urine of AS model mice intervened by moxibustion. RESULTS: Compared with the AS group, the overall health status was significantly improved after 4-week moxibustion intervention (p < 0.05). The results also showed that MA significantly reduced the levels of paw thickness and decreased the levels of four cytokines in the tissue (p < 0.01). Thirty-seven endogenous metabolites identified by the OPLS-DA were considered to be contributing to therapeutic effects of moxibustion. Moreover, metabolic pathway analysis further revealed that the identified metabolites were mainly involved in TCA cycle, Lipid metabolism, Amino Acid metabolism, Intestinal flora metabolism and Purine metabolism. CONCLUSIONS: UHPLC-Q-TOF/MS based metabolomics approach, as a novel and powerful tool, can help us to gain the insights into potential mechanisms of action of moxibustion for AS."
#3501,Buccal acupuncture combined with ultrasound-guided dry needle-evoked inactivation of trigger points to treat cervical and shoulder girdle myofascial pain syndrome,"BACKGROUND: Myofascial pain syndrome (MPS) is a common disease with easy persistence and recurrence. In clinical practice, although many methods have been adopted to prevent and treat MPS, the control of MPS is still not satisfactory. OBJECTIVE: To compare the safety and effectiveness of buccal acupuncture, inactivation of trigger points (MTrPs), and their combination in the treatment of MPS. METHODS: Two hundred MPS patients in the pain clinic were randomly divided into four groups (n= 50) to receive oral drugs (Group A), oral drugs + buccal needle (Group B), oral drugs + MTrP inactivation (Group C), or oral drugs + buccal needle + MTrP inactivation (Group D). RESULTS: The visual analogue scale (VAS) and cervical range of motion (ROM) of Group D were significantly lower than those of the other three groups, and the pressure pain threshold (PPT) value of labelled MTrPs was significantly higher than those of the other three groups (P< 0.05). The excellent rate and total effective rate of Group D were significantly higher than those of the other three groups. Group C had the highest pain score and the lowest acceptance score. The results showed that buccal acupuncture combined with ultrasound-guided dry needle-evoked inactivation of MTrPs can significantly reduce the VAS score of MPS patients, improve the range of motion of the cervical spine, and improve patient satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a highly accepted and satisfactory treatment for MPS, which is worthy of clinical promotion."
#3581,"Cost-effectiveness analysis of acupuncture, counselling and usual care in treating patients with depression: the results of the ACUDep trial","BACKGROUND: New evidence on the clinical effectiveness of acupuncture plus usual care (acupuncture) and counselling plus usual care (counselling) for patients with depression suggests the need to investigate the health-related quality of life and costs of these treatments to understand whether they should be considered a good use of limited health resources. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The cost-effectiveness analyses are based on the Acupuncture, Counselling or Usual care for Depression (ACUDep) trial results. Statistical analyses demonstrate a difference in mean quality adjusted life years (QALYs) and suggest differences in mean costs which are mainly due to the price of the interventions. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis is used to express decision uncertainty. Acupuncture and counselling are found to have higher mean QALYs and costs than usual care. In the base case analysis acupuncture has an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of £4,560 per additional QALY and is cost-effective with a probability of 0.62 at a cost-effectiveness threshold of £20,000 per QALY. Counselling compared with acupuncture is more effective and more costly with an ICER of £71,757 and a probability of being cost-effective of 0.36. A scenario analysis of counselling versus usual care, excluding acupuncture as a comparator, results in an ICER of £7,935 and a probability of 0.91. CONCLUSIONS: Acupuncture is cost-effective compared with counselling or usual care alone, although the ranking of counselling and acupuncture depends on the relative cost of delivering these interventions. For patients in whom acupuncture is unavailable or perhaps inappropriate, counselling has an ICER less than most cost-effectiveness thresholds. However, further research is needed to determine the most cost-effective treatment pathways for depressed patients when the full range of available interventions is considered."
#3625,"Effect of electro-acupuncture on lateralization of the human swallowing motor cortex excitability in healthy subjects: study protocol for a single-blind, randomized controlled trial","BACKGROUND: Numerous randomized controlled trials on the effects of electro-acupuncture have been conducted to treat dysphagia as a sequela of stroke. However, the normal physiological mechanisms of swallowing and the pathological mechanisms of dysphagia are not fully understood. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether lateralization of the human swallowing motor cortex excitability in healthy subjects will be influenced by electro-acupuncture to Lianquan (CV 23) and Fengfu (GV 16), which may provide insight into the pathological mechanisms of dysphagia after stroke. METHODS: We designed a single-blind, randomized, sham-controlled trial in which 40 healthy subjects will be recruited. Subjects will be randomized 1:1 into two groups: the electro-acupuncture group and the sham-control electro-acupuncture group. The swallowing motor cortex will be located in both groups using a neuroimaging navigation system. Then left and right cortical stimulation will be measured by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) before and after electro-acupuncture or sham electro-acupuncture. The electro-acupuncture or sham electro-acupuncture interventions will last for 15 min. The primary outcome measure will be percent change in the resting motor threshold (RMT) of the mylohyoid. The secondary outcome measures will be the amplitude (μV) and latency (ms) of the motor evoked potential (MEP) of the mylohyoid as a proxy for the TMS evoked potential. All outcomes will be measured at baseline and after the electro-acupuncture or sham electro-acupuncture treatment. DISCUSSION: The aim of this trial is to explore whether lateralization of the human swallowing motor cortex excitability in healthy subjects is present, and to determine if electro-acupuncture to acupuncture points Lianquan (CV 23) and Fengfu (GV 16) will exert an effect on it under normal physiological conditions.

#3783,Acupuncture and sleep disorders in Parkinson's disease: A systematic evaluation with meta-analysis,"BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) patients commonly suffer from sleep disorders, significantly impacting their quality of life. Western treatments often entail adverse effects, while acupuncture (ACU) presents a safe, nonaddictive alternative. METHODS: A thorough literature search was performed across PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Embase databases. Eligible studies underwent statistical analysis via RevMan 5.4 software. RESULTS: This study synthesized data from 19 randomized controlled trials involving 1300 patients. The ACU cohort showed notable improvement in Parkinson's disease sleep scale (PDSS) scores (mean difference [MD] = 10.81, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.64, 15.98) relative to controls. Subgroup analysis revealed significance for ACU treatments beyond 6 weeks (MD = 15.39, 95% CI: 11.70, 19.09) but not for those 6 weeks or shorter (MD = 3.51, 95% CI: -1.20, 8.23). Notably, electroacupuncture resulted in significant PDSS score enhancements (MD = 12.39, 95% CI: 6.06, 18.71), with sensitivity analysis verifying result stability. However, without electroacupuncture, PDSS score differences were insignificant (MD = 7.83, 95% CI: -2.33, 17.99) and had lower result stability. Additionally, increased ACU session frequency may yield better improvements in PDSS scores. The ACU group also observed Improved Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index scores (MD = -4.52, 95% CI: -6.36, -2.67). However, no significant variation was identified in Epworth Sleepiness Scale score improvement between groups (MD = -0.90, 95% CI: -3.67, 1.88). CONCLUSION: ACU therapy effectively improves nighttime sleep quality in PD patients. A treatment duration extending beyond 6 weeks is highly recommended. Additionally, increasing the frequency of ACU sessions and incorporating electroacupuncture in the treatment regimen may be essential for optimal results."
#3799,"Immediate effects of microsystem acupuncture in patients with oromyofacial pain and craniomandibular disorders (CMD): a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial","BACKGROUND: Patients presenting with oromyofacial disorders and pain in the head and neck area are often resistant to conventional therapy. Acupuncture has been shown to be effective in pain reduction. METHODS: Twenty-three patients with craniomandibular disorders, headache and, in particular, local pain in the orofacial, cervical and temporomandibular joint areas were randomised into acupuncture or placebo laser therapy groups. Pain was assessed by a visual analogue scale (VAS) and by palpation of 14 muscles and groups of muscles immediately before and after treatment, the assessor being blinded to the patients' allocation. Applicable acupuncture points were searched and pricked using the 'very-point' technique. FINDINGS: Pain reduction measured by VAS was significantly more pronounced after acupuncture than after placebo treatment (p=0.031). Sum of pain scores across 14 muscles was considerably more reduced after acupuncture as compared to sham laser treatment. INTERPRETATION: Acupuncture may bring about immediate pain relief in patients with oromyofacial disorders, increasing the chance to initiate other therapeutic measures."
#3809,"Acupuncture and osteopathic medicine for atopic dermatitis: a three-armed, randomized controlled explorative clinical trial","BACKGROUND: Patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) frequently use acupuncture (ACU) and osteopathic medicine (OM), although their therapeutic benefits are unclear. AIM: To investigate the effectiveness of ACU and OM in patients with AD. METHODS: In a three-armed, single-centre, randomized controlled open explorative clinical trial, adult patients with AD received ACU, OM or no study intervention (control group; CG) plus routine care. Outcomes included disease severity (SCORing Atopic Dermatitis; SCORAD), itching intensity (visual analogue scale; VAS), frequency of topical corticosteroid (TCS) use over 7 days and cost-effectiveness. Endpoints were analysed by analysis of covariance adjusted for the respective baseline value and TCS use. RESULTS: Overall, 121 patients (92 women, 29 men) with a mean ± SD age of 31.4 ± 10.5 years were randomized. After 12 weeks, the adjusted means (95% CI) for ACU, OM and control were, respectively, 22.3 (18.3-26.3), 26.4 (22.6-30.2) and 23.7 (19.9-27.5) for SCORAD (P = 0.32); 27.9 (19.5-36.4), 35.0 (26.9-43.0) and 42.3 (34.7-50.0) for VAS itching (P < 0.05); and 2.3 (0.8-3.9), 1.9 (0.4-3.5) and 4.3 (2.6-6.0), for TCS use (P = 0.10). ACU and OM were not cost-effective compared with the CG. CONCLUSION: Although no differences in disease severity were found, our findings indicate that ACU might reduce itching in patients with AD. Furthermore, ACU and OM showed a trend towards reducing TCS use."
#3814,"A randomized, controlled clinical trial of acupoint catgut embedding as an effective control of functional anorectal pain","BACKGROUND: Patients with functional anorectal pain (FAP) usually feel pain in the anal region, foreign body sensation, and defecation disorders. The pain may radiate to the perineum, thighs, and waist. Conventional biofeedback, local nerve block and surgical treatment have certain limitations. Thread-embedding acupuncture (TEA) is a complementary and alternative therapy, which is widely used in the clinical practice of traditional Chinese medicine to treat functional anorectal pain. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of the catgut-embedding acupuncture in patients with FAP. METHODS: FAP patients were enrolled and randomly divided into a thread-embedding acupuncture group (n = 35) and a sham-embedding acupuncture control group (n = 36). Patients underwent treatment twice monthly for 2 months and were assessed before and after treatments for visual analogue scales (VAS) of anorectal pain, VAS of lumbar pain or soreness, VAS of abdominal distension or pain, anal incontinence index, and SF-36 quality of life. The SF-36 quality of life score included assessment of physical functioning, role-physical, bodily-pain, general health, role-emotional, social functioning, vitality, and mental health. RESULT: The total effective rate was 85.71% for the treatment group versus 8.33% of the controls after 2 months (P < .001). The patients' anal rectum VAS score was significantly higher after treatment versus pretreatment (P < .01), while the physical functioning, role-physical, bodily-pain, role-emotional, and mental health in the experimental group and the role-emotional, and mental health in the control group were all significantly improved versus pretreatment (P < .05). The anorectal VAS score, anal incontinence index, and the SF-36 scores of the physical functioning, role-physical, bodily-pain, role-emotional, and mental health were better in the treatment group compared to the control group (P < .05). Most importantly, there were no adverse reactions observed in either group during the treatment. CONCLUSION: The thread-embedding acupuncture treatment effectively and safely improved the emotional anxiety and quality of life in FAP patients."
#3833,Auricular laser acupuncture as an adjunct for parental anxiety management during children's surgery: A randomized-controlled study,"BACKGROUND: Pediatric surgery is associated with high levels of anxiety for both children and parents/caregivers. To mitigate anxiety, auricular acupuncture has shown its potential in the perioperative setting. Accordingly, our team developed a wearable prototype auricular laser acupuncture system, AcuHealth V1.0, as a portable acupuncture device and conducted a proof-of-concept evaluation with parents of children undergoing surgery. AIMS: The primary aim of this study was to conduct feasibility testing of the AcuHealth V1.0 system in delivering auricular laser acupuncture. METHODS: Parents of children who were scheduled to undergo outpatient surgery were randomly assigned to one of three groups: authentic acupuncture (laser beams at known anxiolytic acupoints, n = 13), sham acupuncture (non-anxiolytic acupoints, n = 14), or a placebo control group (inactive laser, n = 14). Parent self-reported anxiety (0-10 numerical rating scale) was assessed at baseline, pre-intervention (once child was taken to the OR), post-intervention, and at 30 min after the intervention. Usability and acceptability data regarding the device were assessed after the intervention. RESULTS: Baseline data revealed no significant difference in anxiety between the three groups. Parent-reported anxiety level at 30-min post-intervention as compared to baseline in the authentic group was significantly decreased (delta mean ± std = -3.58 ± 2.07) compared to both the sham acupuncture (-1.35 ± 2.65) and placebo control group (0.54 ± 1.13). Evaluation of changes in parent-reported anxiety between groups over time using two-way repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed a significant difference between the three groups (p = 0.001). Post hoc analysis with Scheffe test pairwise comparisons showed that at 30-min post-intervention compared to baseline, the authentic intervention group was significantly less anxious compared with both the sham group (p = 0.033) and the placebo control group (p = 0.001). Additionally, feedback regarding the usage of the device supported the acceptability and usability of the device with no adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study administering laser auricular acupuncture via the AcuHealth V1.0 system decreased parental anxiety after 30 min in parents who received treatment immediately after their children were taken to the operating room with no adverse effect."
#3853,Effect of acupuncture and its influence on cerebral activity in perimenopausal insomniacs: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Perimenopausal insomnia is one of the core symptoms of the menopausal transition. Acupuncture is considered to exert a positive effect on restoring the normal sleep-wake cycle. However, there is little intuitive evidence besides evaluation using clinical effectiveness scales. We therefore designed this study, aiming to use more intuitive and reliable detection techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging before and after applying acupuncture to provide neuroimaging evidence, as well as to verify the effectiveness with other curative effect indicators. METHODS/DESIGN: This study is a randomized, assessor-statistician-blinded, positive medicine controlled trial involving 40 participants. A total of 40 eligible patients with perimenopausal insomnia will be randomly assigned to two groups in a 1:1 ratio as an intervention group using acupuncture and a control group taking estazolam. Participants in the intervention group will receive six acupuncture treatment sessions per week for 4 consecutive weeks, for a total of 24 sessions during the study. Meanwhile, the medicine control group will be prescribed estazolam 1-2 mg/day to be taken 30 minutes before sleep for 4 weeks. The primary outcome is the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Secondary outcomes are the micro-movement sensitive mattress-type sleep monitoring system, the Hamilton Depression Scale, and the Hamilton Anxiety Scale. All outcomes will be evaluated before and after treatment. The safety of interventions will be assessed at every visit. DISCUSSION: The results of this trial, which will be available in 2018, will investigate the impact of acupuncture treating perimenopausal insomnia from assessment of the sleep architecture, hormone level, and emotional-circuit neurological function, and will uncover the effective mechanism of acupuncture regulating the emotional center integrated effect.

#3937,Acupuncture for the Postcholecystectomy Syndrome: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"BACKGROUND: Postcholecystectomy syndrome (PCS) has become a common postoperative syndrome that requires systematic and comprehensive therapy to achieve adequate clinical control. Acupuncture and related therapies have shown clinical effects for PCS in many studies. However, systematic reviews/meta-analyses (SRs/MAs) for them are lacking. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of acupuncture in the treatment of PCS using randomized controlled trials (RCTs). METHODS: Potentially eligible studies were searched in the following electronic databases up to 1 February 2020: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science (WoS), Chinese databases (Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), WanFang Database (WF), and China Science and Technology Journal Database (VIP)), and other sources (WHO ICTRP, ChiCTR, Clinical Trials, and Grey Literature Database). The RevMan 5.3 was employed for analyses. The Cochrane Collaboration' risk of bias tool was used to assess the risk of bias (ROB). The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to assess the quality of the evidence. RESULTS: A total of 14 RCTs with 1593 participants were included in this SR. MA showed that acupuncture in combination with conventional medicine (CM) did not show statistical differences in reduction in pain. However, acupuncture in combination with CM significantly reduced the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) (RR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.55-0.92) and improved gastrointestinal function recovery compared to the CM group. Acupuncture combined with traditional Chinese medicine and CM, and acupuncture as monotherapy may improve gastrointestinal function recovery with acceptable adverse events. CONCLUSION: Acupuncture may be an effective and safe treatment for PCS. However, this study lacks conclusive evidence due to poor quality evidence, limited data, and clinical heterogeneity of acupuncture methods in the included studies."
#3949,The Effect of Acupoint Sticking Therapy on Serum Estrogen Levels and Endometrial Polyp Tissue Receptor Expression in Postmenopausal Patients With Endometrial Polyps,"BACKGROUND: Postmenopausal women with endometrial polyps (EPs) often experience hormonal imbalances. Acupoint application, a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) approach, shows the potential to influence hormonal levels. This study investigated the impact of acupoint application on hormone levels and receptors in postmenopausal women with EP, comparing its efficacy and safety to surgery. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 170 postmenopausal patients with EP. Eighty-four patients received surgery alone, while 86 received surgery combined with acupoint application. Hormone levels, hormone receptor expression, TCM symptom scores, and adverse effects were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: The acupoint application group demonstrated a significantly higher total effective rate than the control group (p < 0.05). After treatment, the acupoint application group exhibited a significantly greater reduction in serum progesterone levels and vaginal pH compared to the control group (p < 0.05). Additionally, the acupoint application group showed a significant increase in endometrial estrogen receptor expression after treatment (p < 0.05). TCM symptom scores related to vaginal bleeding volume, duration, facial complexion, dry mouth, and thirst significantly improved in the acupoint application group post-treatment (p < 0.01). Furthermore, the acupoint application group demonstrated a notably lower incidence of adverse effects (including nausea, headache, breast tenderness, and dizziness) compared to the control group (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Our study suggests acupoint application, alongside surgery, enhances clinical outcomes, hormonal balance, and symptom relief in postmenopausal women with EPs, compared to surgery alone. Its safety and sustained benefits support its use as a complementary treatment."
#3959,Effects of preemptive acupuncture on cognitive function of older patients after hip replacement: a randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Postoperative cognitive impairment is a common complication in older patients after major orthopedic surgery; however, the underlying mechanism is not completely understood. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the effects of preemptive acupuncture on cognitive dysfunction after hip replacement and explore its potential mechanisms. METHODS: Finally, 54 participants were randomized into sham acupuncture (n = 27) or acupuncture (n = 27) groups, who received acupuncture at the Sishencong (EX-HN1) and Baihui (DU20) acupoints, while participants in the sham acup group received sham acup at the target acupoints. Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores, the incidence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD), and other adverse events were assessed. The levels of microRNA (miR)-124 and miR-146a and inflammatory cytokines in the peripheral blood were detected. Correlations among miR-124, miR-146a, and inflammatory cytokines were analyzed. RESULTS: Compared with the sham acup group, the MMSE and MoCA scores in the acup group on the first and seventh day after surgery were higher, and the incidence of POCD on the first day was lower. Acupuncture upregulated levels of miR-124 and -146a and decreased the levels of TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β to protect cognitive function. Correlation analysis indicated that upregulated miR-124 and miR-146 were associated with lower levels of inflammatory cytokines. CONCLUSION: Acupuncture protects postoperative cognitive function in older patients undergoing hip replacement, potentially reducing the incidence of POCD by upregulating miR-124 and miR-146a to inhibit neuroinflammation.

#3980,Electroacupuncture for postoperative ileus after laparoscopic surgery on colorectal cancer: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Postoperative ileus (POI) occurs in almost all patients after abdominal laparoscopic surgery, resulting in complications and increasing the length of hospitalization. Electroacupuncture has been used as an alternative therapy for gastrointestinal dysfunction, but its efficacy for POI is inconclusive. The study is designed to determine whether electroacupuncture can accelerate recovery from POI. METHODS/DESIGN: This study is a three-arm, randomized controlled trial. A total of 105 patients will be randomized into a group receiving electroacupuncture at Tianshu (ST25), a group receiving electroacupuncture at Zusanli (ST36), or a control group in a 1:1:1 ratio. Patients in the electroacupuncture groups will receive electroacupuncture treatment for 4 days from the first day after surgery. The primary outcome consists of the time to first flatus and the time to first defecation. Secondary outcomes include the time to first tolerance of liquid and semiliquid food; the length of the hospital stay; postoperative pain, nausea, and vomiting; abdominal distension; the time to first get out of bed; and postoperative complications. The outcomes will be assessed by the patients themselves every day during hospitalization. Surgeons, nurses, assessors, and statisticians will be blinded to the group assignments. Patients in the two electroacupuncture groups, but not in the control group, will be blinded to the group assignments. The acupuncturists will not be blinded. DISCUSSION: The aim of this trial is to provide a nonpharmacological therapy for POI and may provide evidence of the effect of electroacupuncture at ST25 or ST36 on POI.

#4044,Efficacy and safety of scalp acupuncture for poststroke depression: A meta-analysis and systematic review,"BACKGROUND: Poststroke depression (PSD) is a common clinical poststroke complication that adversely affects cognitive and physical function rehabilitation. Scalp acupuncture (SA) can significantly improve somatic dysfunction and emotional disorder in stroke patients. This meta-analysis aims to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of SA in the treatment of PSD. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive search of multiple electronic databases, including PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Internet, China Science and Technology Journal Database, Wan Fang Data Knowledge Service Platform, and China Biology Medicine databases until December 20, 2022, to identify randomized controlled trials investigating the efficacy of SA in the treatment of PSD. Two independent researchers screened the literature, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias in the included studies based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. We performed a meta-analysis of the eligible literature using RevMan 5.4.1 and Stata 15.0 software. RESULTS: This study comprised a total of 14 randomized controlled trials, 10 of which used SA and 4 of which used SA in combination with electroacupuncture therapy. The results of the meta-analysis revealed that the effective rate of the SA group was significantly higher than that of the Western medicine group (relative risk = 1.09, 95% confidence interval (CI) [1.02, 1.16], P = .008). Moreover, compared to the Western medicine group, the SA group demonstrated significant improvements in Hamilton depression scale scores (mean difference = -2.29, 95% CI [-3.88, -0.70], P = .005) and neurological function deficit scores (mean difference = -3.06, 95% CI [-5.91, -0.21], P = .04). Additionally, the SA group has a lower incidence of adverse events than the western medicine group (relative risk = 0.12, 95% CI [0.05, 0.29], P < .00001). CONCLUSION: SA has superior efficacy and safety compared to Western medicine for PSD. These findings suggest that SA could be a promising alternative treatment for the assessed condition. Due to the limited number and quality of the included literature, the above conclusions must be confirmed by additional high-quality research."
#4052,Effectiveness and safety of acupuncture in post-stroke depression (PSD): Protocol for a Bayesian analysis,"BACKGROUND: Post-stroke depression (PSD) is the most common emotional problem after stroke. It can lower the quality of life and increase the recurrence and mortality. Pharmacological agents have been shown to treat PSD. However, the benefits of pharmacotherapy are debatable and the side-effects are significant. More and more clinical trials suggest that acupuncture plays an important role in patients with PSD. The primary purposes of the study are to conduct a Bayesian analysis of randomized trials to determine the effect of acupuncture and investigate the effect of several acupuncture therapies on PSD. METHODS: We will retrieve articles from 5 English databases [PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry (TCTRP)] and 4 Chinese databases [Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Chinese VIP Information, Wanfang Database, and Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM)]. The publication period will be from inception to January 2019. All randomized controlled trials that evaluate the safety and efficacy of acupuncture on PSD will be included. The primary outcomes will be the change in the degree of depression as measured by the Hamilton Depression Scale and Beck Depression Inventory. Two reviewers will separately extract the data and assess the risk of bias by using the Cochrane Collaboration's risk of bias tool. Bayesian analysis will be conducted to pool the effects of several acupunctures. The ranking probabilities for several acupunctures (simple acupuncture, fire needle, warm acupuncture, auriculo-acupuncture, or electroacupuncture) will be estimated by the surface under the cumulative ranking curve. RESULT: This study will provide reliable evidence for acupuncture on PSD. CONCLUSION: The results of this review will introduce a safe and effective treatment and provide reliable evidence to evaluate the effectiveness of several acupuncture therapies on PSD.

#4055,Effects of Electroacupuncture on Gut Microbiota and Fecal Metabolites in Rats with Poststroke Depression,"BACKGROUND: Poststroke depression (PSD) is the most frequent neuropsychiatric consequence of stroke. Electroacupuncture (EA) has been found to be an effective therapy for treating PSD. However, the underlying mechanisms of EA's efficacy remain unclear. This research aimed to investigate the effects of EA on alterations in gut microbiota and fecal metabolome in PSD rats. METHODS: Analyses of gut microbiome and fecal metabolome were performed to identify gut microbes and their functional metabolites in a sham group, PSD group, and EA group. We conducted enrichment analysis to identify the differential metabolic pathways in three groups. Correlations between altered gut microbes and differential metabolites after EA treatment were studied. RESULTS: PSD showed decreased species-richness/diversity indices of microbial composition, characterized by an increase in Muribaculaceae, Peptostreptococcaceae, Oscillospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, and Clostridiaceae and a decrease in Lactobacillaceae, Lachnospiraceae, and Bacteroidaceae. Of these, the abundance of Muribaculaceae, Lactobacillaceae, Lachnospiraceae, Peptostreptococcaceae, and Clostridiaceae were reversed by EA. Furthermore, PSD was associated with 34 differential fecal metabolites, mainly belonging to steroid hormone biosynthesis, that could be regulated by EA. CONCLUSION: Regulation of gut microbiome and lipid metabolism could be one of the potential mechanisms for EA treatment for alleviating the depressive behaviors of PSD."
#4089,Wrist-ankle acupuncture (WAA) for precompetition nervous syndrome: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Precompetition nervous syndrome comprises an excessive nervous and anxiety response to the high-pressure environment preceding a sporting competition. The use of acupuncture as a treatment option for anxiety, and wrist-ankle acupuncture (WAA) specifically in this instance, has been identified as a growing trend within the Western world. In our previous study, we have confirmed the efficacy of WAA for pre-examination anxiety. In this paper, we present a randomized controlled single-blind trial evaluating the use of WAA for precompetition nervous syndrome, comparing it with the intervention of sham acupuncture. METHODS/DESIGN: The study was designed as a randomized controlled single-blind trial to evaluate the effects of WAA for precompetition anxiety. The trial will be conducted in annual track and field events of Shanghai University of Sport. A total of 100 participants who meet inclusion criteria are randomly assigned by computerized randomization to receive WAA therapy or sham acupuncture. The group allocations and interventions are concealed to participants and statisticians. The Competition State Anxiety Scale (CSAI-2) is used as the primary outcome measure, while heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory frequency, tension syndrome curative effect evaluation and participants' feeling of acupuncture questionnaire are applied as secondary outcome measures. DISCUSSION: The results of this trial will confirm whether WAA is effective to treat precompetition anxiety in annual track and field events.

A systematic search was performed across 12 electronic databases from inception to March 30, 2024. Eligibility screening was performed according to predefined criteria, followed by the quality assessment utilizing the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. Data analysis was conducted using Stata 18.0. Network meta-analysis applied the node-cut method for the consistency test, and used the surface under the cumulative ranking curve to reflect the likelihood of each non-pharmacological intervention being the best intervention. RESULTS: Thirty-six randomized controlled trials were examined (N = 4511 participants). The surface under the cumulative ranking curve identified music-relaxation as the highest-ranked therapy for pain reduction (97.1%), and manipulation-acupuncture as the highest-ranked therapy for physical function indicators (78.3%). CONCLUSION: Limited evidence indicated that music-relaxation therapy may be the most effective strategy for alleviating pain, while manipulation-acupuncture therapy may be optimal for enhancing physical function. Integrated non-pharmacological interventions demonstrated greater effectiveness compared to monotherapy in improving PLBP."

CONCLUSION: This study will provide comprehensive evidence of acupuncture and moxibustion for patients with PD. INPLASY REGISTRATION NUMBER: INPLASY2020500106."
#4190,Auricular acupuncture with seed or pellet attachments for primary insomnia: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"BACKGROUND: Primary insomnia is a common health issue in the modern world. We conducted a systematic review of the auricular therapy, aiming to evaluate whether there are advantages of auricular acupuncture with seed or pellet attachments for the treatment of primary insomnia. METHODS: A search of relevant literatures was performed on major medical databases, including Medline, Embase, CENTRAL, CBM, CNKI, VIP, Wanfang Data and so on. Risk of bias evaluation, meta-analysis, sensitivity analysis and evidence rating of all extracted information were conducted also. RESULTS: A total of 1381 records were identified, with 15 studies deemed eligible for the present review. Meta-analyses were conducted in two comparisons separately: participants received auricular acupuncture were more likely to make an improvement in clinical effective rate (RR = 1.40, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.83), sleep duration (MD = 56.46, 95% CI 45.61 to 67.31), sleep efficiency(MD = 12.86, 95% CI 9.67 to 16.06), global score on PSQI (MD = -3.41, 95% CI -3.93 to -2.89), number of awakenings( MD = -3.27, 95% CI -6.30 to -0.25) and sleep onset latency(MD = -10.35, 95% CI -14.37 to -6.33) when compared to sham auricular acupuncture or placebo; while in auricular acupuncture VS medications comparison, a better effective rate (RR = 1.24, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.34), better sleep efficiency(MD = 21.44, 95% CI 16.30 to 26.58), lower PSQI score (MD = -3.62, 95% CI -4.59 to -2.65) and less adverse effect (RR = 0.11, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.26) can be seen also in auricular acupuncture group. Although these results suggested benefits of auricular acupuncture, the overall quality of evidence rated by the GRADE system was low. CONCLUSION: Statistical analyses of the outcomes revealed a positive effect of auricular acupuncture for primary insomnia. Nonetheless, considering the poor methodological quality, insufficient sample size and possible publication bias, current evidence is not yet adequate to provide a strong support for the use of auricular acupuncture in the treatment of primary insomnia. More strictly designed clinical studies will be needed to obtain a more explicit conclusion."
#4213,Acupuncture combined with herbal medicine versus herbal medicine alone for plaque psoriasis: a systematic review protocol,"BACKGROUND: Psoriasis is a condition with a multifactorial etiopathogenesis worldwide, and plaque psoriasis, which is characterized by redness, thickness, and scaling, is the most common kind. Individuals living with psoriasis show low levels of life quality, and having fewer or less extensive lesions may improve spiritual and mental health. Therefore, our objective is to explore the effectiveness of acupuncture combined with herbal medicine for plaque psoriasis and to compare acupuncture combined with herbal medicine with herbal medicine alone. METHODS: Databases including PubMed, MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, Excerpta Medica (EMBASE), the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), the China National Knowledge Infrastructure Database (CNKI), the Wanfang database and the Chinese Scientific Journal Database (VIP database) will be searched from inception to March 2018. We will employ hand searches, and grey literature will also be obtained. Only randomized controlled trials evaluating acupuncture combined with herbal medicine to treat plaque psoriasis in adults will be assessed. The Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score (PASI score), the itching index, the life quality scores, and the anxiety index will be the outcome measures. Two independent reviewers will select the articles included, assess the risk of bias and extract data according to the inclusion criteria. A third reviewer will resolve disagreements. The purpose of this study will be to identify the effect of acupuncture combined with herbal medicine on the lesions (PASI score), symptoms (itching index, life quality scores) and mental status (anxiety index) of the patients. DISCUSSION: The meta-analysis will retrospectively examine current evidence regarding the effectiveness of the practice of acupuncture combined with herbal medicine to treat plaque psoriasis. This study may reveal, for the first time, an adjuvant therapy for psoriasis. TRIAL REGISTRATION: As the study is a systematic review protocol, trial registration will not be necessary. An article containing the results will be published in a peer-reviewed journal and disseminated through scientific conferences."
#4233,Exploration of registration and the risk of bias in acupuncture randomised controlled trials: a systematic review protocol,"BACKGROUND: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are the predominant type in acupuncture clinical research, and the publications have increased rapidly in recent years, but there is a prevalence of the high risk of bias and poor methodological design in acupuncture RCTs. Clinical trial registration can improve the transparency and credibility of studies by disclosing key information in advance. However, the registration in acupuncture RCTs is not satisfactory, as there is widespread of the under-registration, inconsistency with published studies and insufficient disclosure of key methodological information. Whether registration can reduce the risk of bias in acupuncture RCTs and improve data transparency has not been fully explored. Therefore, we constructed this study to investigate the association between registration and risk of bias and data sharing level in acupuncture RCTs. METHODS: Seven databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, CBM, CNKI, Wanfang and VIP databases will be systematically searched between 1 January 2014 and 31 March 2024, for acupuncture RCTs. Two reviewers will independently extract data using a predefined standardised format and perform secondary validation. The characteristics and data sharing level of the included studies will be summarised. The risk of bias of included RCTs will be assessed by the revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomised trials. The risk of bias and registration in acupuncture RCTs will be analysed by logistic or quantile regression analyses (depending on the number of minimum events). The data sharing level and registration will be analysed by quantile regression analyses. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: As the systematic review aims to consolidate info from published sources, ethical approval is not necessary for this study. The study's findings will be submitted to a peer-reviewed academic journal and disseminated via conference presentations. This protocol has been registered in Open Science Framework Registries."
#4237,"Quality assessment of reporting of randomization, allocation concealment, and blinding in traditional Chinese medicine RCTs: a review of 3159 RCTs identified from 260 systematic reviews","BACKGROUND: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which are of poor quality tend to exaggerate the effect estimate and lead to wrong or misleading conclusions. The aim of this study is to assess the quality of randomization methods, allocation concealment and blinding within traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) RCTs, discuss issues identified for current TCM RCTs, and provide suggestions for quality improvement. METHODS: We searched Chinese Biomedical Database (CBM, 1978 to July 31, 2009) and the Cochrane Library (Issue 2, 2009) to collect TCM systematic reviews and meta-analyses according to inclusion/exclusion criteria, from which RCTs could be identified. The quality assessment involved whether the randomization methods, allocation concealment and blinding were adequate or not based the study reported. Stratified analyses were conducted of different types of diseases published in different journals (both Chinese and foreign) using different interventions. SPSS 15.0 software was used for statistic analyses. RESULTS: A total of 3159 RCTs were included, of which 2580 were published in Chinese journals and 579 in foreign journals. There were 381 (12%) RCTs which used adequate randomization methods; 207 (7%) RCTs which used adequate allocation concealment and 601 (19%) which used adequate blinding; there were 130 (4%) RCTs which both used adequate randomization methods and allocation concealment; and there were only 100 (3%) RCTs which used adequate randomization methods, allocation concealment, as well as blinding. In the RCTs published in foreign journals, the adequate randomization methods, allocation concealment and blinding accounted for a relatively large proportion (25%, 26%, and 60%, respectively) and increased with years, while in the RCTs published in Chinese journals, only the adequate randomization methods improved over time. The quality of non-drug intervention (chiefly acupuncture) RCTs was higher than that of drug intervention RCTs. In drug intervention, the quality of listed drugs is higher than the others. The quality of all included RCTs of all types of diseases was generally poor and no studies that were large in size and of high quality were found. CONCLUSION: The quality of the current TCM RCTs as judged by their publications is generally poor, especially those published in Chinese journals. In future, researchers of TCM RCTs should attach more importance to experimental design and methodological quality, receive relevant training, and improve reporting quality using the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement, so as to improve the quality of TCM clinical research and ensure truth and reliability of conclusions."
#4256,Systematic review of the management options available for low anterior resection syndrome (LARS),"BACKGROUND: Rectal cancer incidence is increasing. Low anterior resection is currently the gold standard surgical management. Postoperatively, patients may present with symptoms indicative of low anterior resection syndrome (LARS). LARS can be debilitating and is difficult to treat with low efficacy of treatment modalities. This systematic review aims to highlight the current evidence regarding LARS management. METHODS: Systematic review of Medline, Cochrane and Embase used the following terms: ""low anterior resection syndrome"" AND ""management"", ""low anterior resection syndrome"" AND ""treatment"". Articles that focus solely of low anterior resection syndrome management in patients > 18 years were included. Bias risk was assessed via the Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale for cohort studies and the JBI critical appraisal tool for randomized controlled trials. Due to heterogeneity of methodology, no statistical analysis was performed. RESULTS: Thirty-eight articles with a total of 1914 patients were included in this review. Ninety-five per cent underwent surgery for malignancy. Treatment options included pharmacology, pelvic floor rehabilitation (PFR), transanal irrigation (TAI), sacral nerve modulation (SNM), percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS) and ""treatment programs"" starting from the least invasive procedures escalating to more invasive treatments upon failure. The most common published medical therapies report Ramoestron use; however, studies are low impact. PFR showed significant improvement in LARS mostly in those with symptoms of faecal incontinence. However, long-term outcomes are inconsistent. TAI supplies pseudo-continence with its greatest benefit reported in those with incomplete evacuation. TAI has significant short-term effects on LARS but little long-term effect. TAI is also associated with a significant drop-out rate. SNM's hypothesised benefit is extrapolated from non-LARS associated FI. Results show improvements in FI but a high rate of explantation. PTNS evidence suggests little if any significant LARS improvement. A single ""stepwise programme"" study reported that 77 per cent did not progress further than diet and medication. Little evidence suggests benefit regarding diet or acupuncture. DISCUSSION: There is no consensus as to the optimal treatment strategy for LARS. LARS is multifactorial and requires sensitive discussion between patient and surgeon to address the most prominent symptom. It requires physical and psychological input. No single treatment option provides superior results. Treatment is based on symptom control and patient acceptance."
#4366,Acupuncture treatment of shoulder impingement syndrome: A randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Shoulder pain or omalgia is one of the main types of osteoarticular pain that can be observed in every-day clinical practice, frequently causing significant functional impairment. The most common cause of shoulder pain is impingement syndrome. OBJECTIVE: To decrease the intensity of short- and mid-term pain in the injured shoulder by means of acupuncture. METHOD: Randomized controlled trial with two groups of participants: one group received true acupuncture (TA) and the other received acupuncture at sham points (SA). The treatment was carried out over 4 weeks, with the participants receiving a session every week. The results were measured immediately after the treatment (T1) and 3 months later (T2). To evaluate the results, we used the 100 mm Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), and to assess the functionality of the shoulder we employed the UCLA questionnaire (0-35 points). RESULTS: A total of 68 participants were included in the analysis (TA, n=35; SA, n=33), with a mean age of 33.4 years (SD 12.53). We found significant differences in the analyzed results between the two groups, as we observed a decrease on the intensity of pain for the TA group of 44.13 mm at T1 (CI 95% 36.7; 51.5) and 87.58 mm at T2 (CI 95% 28.32; 46.81), while the decrease in the FA group was of 19.84 mm at T1 (CI 95% 12.2; 27.4) and 20 mm at T2 (CI 95% 10.9; 29.09). When the UCLA scores were analyzed, the results were clinically meaningful in support of TA in terms of functional assessment of the shoulder. No adverse effects were reported. CONCLUSIONS: The use of acupuncture to treat impingement syndrome seems to be a safe and reliable technique to achieve clinically significant results and could be implemented in the therapy options offered by the health services."
#4388,Effect of acupuncture on cognitive impairment induced by sleep deprivation in animal models: a preclinical systematic review and meta-analysis,"BACKGROUND: Sleep deprivation (SD) has been associated with cognitive deficits, mediated by mechanisms such as neuroinflammation and oxidative stress. Acupuncture, a core component of traditional Chinese medicine, has shown promise in mitigating SD-induced cognitive impairment. However, the effectiveness and underlying mechanisms of acupuncture need further validation through high-quality evidence. This study aims to evaluate the therapeutic effects and molecular mechanisms of acupuncture on cognitive impairment resulting from SD by conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: This study comprehensively searched eight databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that examine the effects of acupuncture on SD-induced cognitive impairment. Primary outcomes were assessed using the Morris Water Maze (MWM), including measures of escape latency and time spent in the target quadrant. Secondary outcomes focused on molecular markers such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB), and indicators of oxidative stress. The risk of bias was evaluated using the SYRCLE tool, and data were analyzed using R software. Standardized mean differences (MD) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. RESULTS: Eight RCTs involving 222 rodents were analyzed. The findings indicate that acupuncture significantly improves cognitive performance in SD models, evidenced by increased platform crossings [MD = 1.67, 95% CI (1.42, 1.91)] and extended time in the target quadrant [MD = 8.54, 95% CI (6.35, 10.73)], along with reduced escape latency [MD = -8.33, 95% CI (-11.68, -4.99)]. Electroacupuncture (EA) was found to regulate the expression of BDNF and its receptor, TrkB, and to decrease oxidative stress markers such as malondialdehyde (MDA) while enhancing antioxidant activities, including those of superoxide dismutase (SOD). Manual acupuncture (MA) influenced apoptosis markers by decreasing Bax and increasing Bcl-2 expression. Despite these positive findings, the studies exhibited heterogeneity in intervention methods and variability in acupuncture techniques. CONCLUSION: This study preliminarily confirms that acupuncture, specifically electroacupuncture, and manual acupuncture, can effectively alleviate cognitive impairment caused by sleep deprivation. The benefits are observed through modulation of BDNF-TrkB signaling, reduction in oxidative stress, and regulation of apoptosis. Although the current evidence is derived from animal studies, it suggests potential applications in human clinical trials to explore the viability of acupuncture for treating cognitive impairment related to SD.

#4469,Acupuncture for stroke rehabilitation,"BACKGROUND: Stroke is the second most common cause of death in the world and in China it has now become the main cause of death. It is also a main cause of adult disability and dependency. Acupuncture for stroke has been used in China for hundreds of years and is increasingly practiced in some Western countries. This is an update of the Cochrane review originally published in 2006 . OBJECTIVES: To determine the efficacy and safety of acupuncture therapy in people with subacute and chronic stroke. We intended to test the following hypotheses: 1) acupuncture can reduce the risk of death or dependency in people with subacute and chronic stroke at the end of treatment and at follow-up; 2) acupuncture can improve neurological deficit and quality of life after treatment and at the end of follow-up; 3) acupuncture can reduce the number of people requiring institutional care; and 4) acupuncture is not associated with any intolerable adverse effects. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (June 2015), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; Cochrane Library 2015, Issue 7), MEDLINE (1966 to July 2015, Ovid), EMBASE (1980 to July 2015, Ovid), CINAHL (1982 to July 2015, EBSCO), and AMED (1985 to July 2015, Ovid). We also searched the following four Chinese medical databases: China Biological Medicine Database (July 2015); Chinese Science and Technique Journals Database (July 2015); China National Infrastructure (July 2015), and Wan Fang database (July 2015). SELECTION CRITERIA: Truly randomised unconfounded clinical trials among people with ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke, in the subacute or chronic stage, comparing acupuncture involving needling with placebo acupuncture, sham acupuncture, or no acupuncture. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed quality, extracted and cross-checked the data. MAIN RESULTS: We included 31 trials with a total of 2257 participants in the subacute or chronic stages of stroke. The methodological quality of most of the included trials was not high. The quality of evidence for the main outcomes was low or very low based on the assessment by the system of Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE).Two trials compared real acupuncture plus baseline treatment with sham acupuncture plus baseline treatment. There was no evidence of differences in the changes of motor function and quality of life between real acupuncture and sham acupuncture for people with stroke in the convalescent stage.Twenty-nine trials compared acupuncture plus baseline treatment versus baseline treatment alone. Compared with no acupuncture, for people with stroke in the convalescent phase, acupuncture had beneficial effects on the improvement of dependency (activity of daily living) measured by Barthel Index (nine trials, 616 participants; mean difference (MD) 9.19, 95% confidence interval (CI) 4.34 to 14.05; GRADE very low), global neurological deficiency (seven trials, 543 participants; odds ratio (OR) 3.89, 95% CI 1.78 to 8.49; GRADE low), and specific neurological impairments including motor function measured by Fugl-Meyer Assessment (four trials, 245 participants; MD 6.16, 95% CI 4.20 to 8.11; GRADE low), cognitive function measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination (five trials, 278 participants; MD 2.54, 95% CI 0.03 to 5.05; GRADE very low), depression measured by the Hamilton Depression Scale (six trials, 552 participants; MD -2.58, 95% CI -3.28 to -1.87; GRADE very low), swallowing function measured by drinking test (two trials, 200 participants; MD -1.11, 95% CI -2.08 to -0.14; GRADE very low), and pain measured by the Visual Analogue Scale (two trials, 118 participants; MD -2.88, 95% CI -3.68 to -2.09; GRADE low). Sickness caused by acupuncture and intolerance of pain at acupoints were reported in a few participants with stroke in the acupuncture groups. No data on death, the proportion of people requiring institutional care or requiring extensive family support, and all-cause mortality were available in all included trials. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: From the available evidence, acupuncture may have beneficial effects on improving dependency, global neurological deficiency, and some specific neurological impairments for people with stroke in the convalescent stage, with no obvious serious adverse events. However, most included trials were of inadequate quality and size. There is, therefore, inadequate evidence to draw any conclusions about its routine use. Rigorously designed, randomised, multi-centre, large sample trials of acupuncture for stroke are needed to further assess its effects."
#4576,Effects of electroacupuncture to the trigeminal nerve area on the autonomic nervous system and cerebral blood flow in the prefrontal cortex,"BACKGROUND: The autonomic nervous system and trigeminal nerve are involved in adjusting flow through diverging cerebral arteries in the prefrontal cortex. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of 100 Hz electroacupuncture (EA) to the trigeminal nerve area on cerebral blood flow and autonomic nervous system function. METHOD: This was a randomised crossover study of 16 healthy volunteers who were assigned to an EA or control group. Stimulation (in the EA group) was performed five times, each after 1 min of rest. Needles were inserted at the inner edge of the eyebrows and 1 cm from the front hairline midpoint. We used high-frequency (HF) and low-frequency (LF) components of heart rate (HR) variability to assess autonomic nervous system function. HF and LF/HF ratio were taken as indicators of parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system activity, respectively. We measured cerebral blood flow using a two-channel near-infrared spectroscope. RESULTS: In the EA group, HR significantly decreased (p=0.004) and HF significantly increased (p=0.006) relative to baseline. By contrast, there were no significant changes in HR or HF within the control group (p>0.05). Accordingly, HR tended to be lower (p=0.087) and HF greater (p=0.071) in the EA group versus the control group. There were no significant differences in LF/HF ratio within/between groups. Compared with the control group, cerebral blood flow was significantly greater in the left (p=0.048) and right (p=0.016) prefrontal cortex in the EA group. CONCLUSIONS: Delivery of 100 Hz EA to the trigeminal nerve area reduces HR and increases parasympathetic nervous activity and cerebral blood flow."
#4612,Systematic review and meta-analysis of cardiac neurosis for development of clinical practice guidelines of Korean medicine,"BACKGROUND: The development of clinical practice guidelines in traditional medicine requires evidence that sufficiently reflects the medical field. Cardiac neurosis is a disease that occurs because of problems in the autonomic nervous system and is characterized by symptoms of the circulatory system that are representative of autonomic dysfunction. In traditional medicine, the heart is considered to be involved in mental health problems, and cardiac neurosis is accompanied by a variety of mental symptoms. Furthermore, there is a categorized diagnosis for cardiac neurosis, and active empirical research is being conducted in China. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to systematically review and quantitatively synthesize the effects of Korean medicine treatments in patients with cardiac neurosis to develop evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of autonomic dysfunction. METHODS: Nine databases were searched for articles published before September 13, 2022. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed using the RoB tool. The primary outcomes were somatization, depression, anxiety, and effectiveness rate. The secondary outcome was the rate of adverse effects. RESULTS: Based on a systematic literature review, 151 randomized controlled trials were selected and analyzed. For patients with cardiac neurosis, herbal medicine, combined treatment of herbal medicine and Western medicine, combined treatment of herbal medicine and acupuncture, acupuncture, and combined treatment of acupuncture and Western medicine showed better overall effects than Western medicine alone. Furthermore, the combined treatment of herbal medicine and psychotherapy and that of herbal medicine, psychotherapy, and Western medicine showed an overall better effect than the combined treatment of Western medicine and psychotherapy. CONCLUSION: A meta-analysis of articles revealed the effectiveness of Korean medicine treatments and verified the effectiveness of a Korean medicine treatment alone, Korean medicine combined treatment, and combined treatment of Korean medicine and Western medicine on cardiac neurosis. Limitations included the inability to verify the cause of high heterogeneity between studies and the poor quality of the included studies. Nevertheless, this systematic review and meta-analysis of cardiac neurosis showed that the disease concept of traditional medicine can also be organized based on the latest research. Future research related to traditional diseases such as these should be conducted.

#4650,The efficacy of acupuncture-based chinese medicine in chronic fatigue syndrome: A meta-analysis,"BACKGROUND: The efficacy of acupuncture therapy in treating chronic fatigue syndrome remains a matter of intense debate owing to contradictory findings. This article describes a systematic review and meta-analysis to study its effect on fatigue, functional mobility, and mental health. METHODS: A thorough search of PubMed, PEDro, CINAHL, SportDiscus, and Scopus was performed. The studies meeting the PICO criteria for the Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome were independently screened, and the data were extracted. Standardized mean differences with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using fixed or random-effects models. Publication bias and study quality were assessed to ensure reliability. RESULTS: Acupuncture demonstrated potential benefits in improving near-term fatigue (RR = -1.21, 95% CI: -1.38 to -1.04), long-term fatigue (RR = -0.56, 95% CI: -0.70 to -0.42), somatic and mental health (RR = -0.30, 95% CI: -1.03 to 0.44), and reducing depression incidence (RR = -0.28, 95% CI: -2.11 to 1.56) in patients with CFS as an effective treatment modality. CONCLUSIONS: Acupuncture, especially when combined with rehabilitation, seems to improve fatigue and quality of life among patients with CFS. However, results should be considered carefully since some methodological weaknesses are worth mentioning, such as diversity between studies and the inclusion of lower-quality clinical trials. Future research should consider the importance of conducting large-scale, multicenter randomized controlled trials with standardized methodology to confirm these findings."
#4685,Evaluating the relationship between induced aniseikonia and distance stereopsis,"BACKGROUND: The impact of aniseikonia on stereopsis has been studied for decades, however, inconsistency which may be partly attributed to the method of inducing aniseikonia exists among these findings. This study aimed to induce overall and meridional aniseikonia using a three-dimensional (3D) computer and then evaluate the effect of induced aniseikonia on distance stereopsis using contour-based and random-dot-based patterns. METHODS: A 3D laptop was used to produce all of the test symbols. Unlike the usual method of creating aniseikonia with size lenses, which would change not only the size but also the relative position of the test symbols in the two images as seen by the two eyes, a new test system was designed to evaluate the aniseikonia, which only modified the size while maintaining the relative position of the test symbols. This new method reduced the disparities induced by location changing of the paired test targets when inducing aniseikonia. Aniseikonia was induced overall or in one of the meridians. The induced meridional aniseikonia included 180°, 30°, 45°, 60°, and 90°, respectively. The range of induced aniseikonia was 0-30% with an increment of 5%. RESULTS: Overall magnification affected stereopsis more than magnification in any one of the meridians. The stereoacuity differences between oblique meridians (30°, 45°, and 60°) were not significant until the aniseikonia increased up to 20%. The difference between 180°, 45°, and 90° was significant when the aniseikonia increased up to 10% in the contour-based test and over 20% in the random-dot-based test. The stereoacuity trend was improved gradually, coupled with the angle changing from 180º to 90º in the contour-based pattern, and deteriorated gradually in the random-dot-based pattern. CONCLUSIONS: Overall aniseikonia affected stereopsis more than meridional aniseikonia. The stereoacuity of the contour-based pattern was superior to that of the random-dot-based pattern in the 90° meridian, while the opposite result was obtained in the 180° meridian."
#4701,Effect of acupuncture on insomnia following stroke: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: The incidence, mortality, and prevalence of stroke are high in China. Stroke is commonly associated with insomnia; both insomnia and stroke have been effectively treated with acupuncture for a long time. The aim of this proposed trial is to assess the therapeutic effect of acupuncture on insomnia following stroke. METHODS: This proposed study is a single-center, single-blinded (patient-assessor-blinded), parallel-group randomized controlled trial. We will randomly assign 60 participants with insomnia following stroke into two groups in a 1:1 ratio. The intervention group will undergo traditional acupuncture that achieves the De-qi sensation, and the control group will receive sham acupuncture without needle insertion. The same acupoints (DU20, DU24, EX-HN3, EX-HN22, HT7, and SP6) will be used in both groups. Treatments will be given to all participants three times a week for the subsequent 4 weeks. The primary outcome will be the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. The secondary outcomes will be: the Insomnia Severity Index; sleep efficacy, sleep awakenings, and total sleep time recorded via actigraphy; the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale; the Stroke-Specific Quality of Life score; the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. The use of estazolam will be permitted and regulated under certain conditions. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline, 2 weeks after treatment commencement, 4 weeks after treatment commencement, and at the 8-week follow-up. DISCUSSION: This proposed study will contribute to expanding knowledge about acupuncture treatment for insomnia following stroke. This will be a high-quality randomized controlled trial with strict methodology and few design deficits. It will investigate the effectiveness of acupuncture as an alternative treatment for insomnia following stroke. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry identifier: ChiCTR-IIC-16008382 .

#4706,Evaluation of Auricular Acupressure on Myopia Prevention among Children Aged 6-12 Years with Pre-Myopia in China: Study Protocol of a Prospective Multi-Center Randomized Controlled Trial,"BACKGROUND: The increasing prevalence of myopia among Chinese children and adolescents, especially at younger ages, has emerged as a significant concern in recent years. Pre-myopia is a key period for myopia prevention and control in children and adolescents. Previous studies suggested auricular acupressure (AA) therapy might offer a viable approach to prevent and slow down myopia progression. Nonetheless, these studies lack robust, high-quality, large-scale, multi-center evidence to conclusively support such assertions. The purpose of this research is to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and economic benefits of AA therapy in preventing myopia in Chinese children aged 6-12 years with pre-myopia. METHODS: The single-blind, multi-center, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial will involve 318 pre-myopic children from 20 different centers across China. After recruitment, these participants will be randomly assigned to two groups (the AA group and the control group) at a 1:1 ratio. The AA group will receive auricular point sticking therapy along with health education for a period of 24 weeks, while the control group will be provided the sham AA treatment and routine health education. The assessments of outcomes will be conducted at the start of this study, and then after 4, 8, 12, and 24 weeks. The primary outcome is the change in spherical equivalent refraction at various follow-up times. The secondary outcomes include the number of myopia cases, uncorrected visual acuity, axial length, corneal curvature radius, accommodation amplitude, retinal and choroidal thickness, and eye behavior management. In addition, the cost-effectiveness analysis will be used as the evaluation index for economic assessment. DISCUSSION: The results of this research will provide evidence on the efficacy, safety, and economic benefits of AA therapy in preventing myopia among children aged 6-12 years with pre-myopia in China."

#4715,Acupuncture-adjuvant therapies for treating perimenopausal depression: A network meta-analysis,"BACKGROUND: The issues related to the treatment of perimenopausal depression (PMD) are the side effects of antidepressants and hormone replacement therapy. The aim of this study was to assess the efficiency and safety of acupuncture and moxibustion in PMD patients. METHODS: Databases, namely PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, EMBASE, CNKI, CBM, VIP, and WanFang, were reviewed for related randomized controlled trials dated between database inception and November 22, 2022. The primary outcomes were the efficacy rate and the Hamilton Depression Scale score. The secondary outcomes were the levels of follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, and estradiol and the Kupperman score. Odds ratios (ORs) were generated as the effect size for dichotomous outcomes, while the standard mean difference (SMD) ± standard deviation was used for continuous outcomes. Matrices were developed to demonstrate pairwise comparisons of regimens related to each endpoint. Utilizing Review Manager (RevMan) 5.3, Stata 16.0 and SPSS 21, data were analyzed. RESULTS: In total, 27 studies involving 2269 PMD patients and 8 therapeutic measures were incorporated into the network meta-analysis (NMA). The NMA showed that warm acupuncture (OR = 1.55, 95% CI: 1.00-2.44), electroacupuncture (OR = 1.34, 95% CI: 1.00-1.8), abdominal acupuncture (OR = 1.19, 95% CI: 0.73-1.96), and common acupuncture (OR = 1.4, 95% CI: 0.9-2.17) were more effective than fluoxetine + menopausal hormone treatment in the treatment of PMD. The NMA also showed that, based on the Hamilton Depression Scale score, warm acupuncture was more effective than the other 4 acupuncture-related treatments, i.e., electroacupuncture (SMD = -1.22, 95% CI: -2.34 to -0.09), thread embedding (SMD = -1.31, 95% CI: -2.21 to -0.40), abdominal acupuncture (SMD = -1.33, 95% CI: -2.42 to -0.24), and common acupuncture (SMD = -1.46, 95% CI: -2.26 to -0.66). The cumulative ranking probability (SUCRA) showed that warm acupuncture (99.6%) was the best treatment method. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this network meta-analysis may help patients and therapists choose the best acupuncture therapy for treating perimenopausal depression patients and furnish reliable evidence for guidelines."
#4721,Acupuncture of fascia points to relieve hand spasm after stroke: a study protocol for a multicenter randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: The loss of functional ability of patients after stroke is mostly caused by dysfunction of the upper limbs, especially the hands. Hand functional exercise is the premise of alleviating hand dysfunction, and the relief of hand spasm is the basis of timely and effective hand functional exercise. Previous clinical observation have shown that fascial-point needling can effectively alleviate hand spasm immediately after stroke, but further evidence from large-sample studies is needed. The overall objective of this trial is to further evaluate the clinical efficacy of fascial-point acupuncture on hand spasm after stroke. METHODS/DESIGN: This multicenter randomized controlled trial will compare the efficacy of fascial-point acupuncture versus sham acupuncture and routine rehabilitation therapy in stroke patients with hand spasm. Patients will be randomized to undergo either the fascial-point acupuncture, the sham acupuncture or the control (routine rehabilitation therapy). We will recruit 210 stroke inpatients who meet the trial criteria and observe the remission of hand spasm and improvement of limb function after 4 weeks of intervention. The first evaluation indices are the remission of hand spasm and the duration of spasm remission. The second evaluation indices are the hand function of the affected limbs and the activities of daily living. When the accumulative total number of cases included reaches 120, a mid-term analysis will be conducted to determine any evidence that experimental intervention does have an advantage. DISCUSSION: Our aim is to evaluate the efficacy of fascial-point acupuncture in relieving hand spasm after stroke. The results should provide more evidence for the clinical application of this therapy in the future. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR), ID: ChiCTR1900022379.

#4723,Optimal acupuncture methods for lower limb motor dysfunction after stroke: a systematic review and network meta-analysis,"BACKGROUND: The lower limb motor dysfunction caused by stroke is one of the main sequelae affecting patients' ability to live normally in the later period. Acupuncture treatment of limb movement dysfunction after stroke has been recommended by authoritative guidelines for reducing limb spasticity, enhancing limb strength and so on. However, the efficacy of different acupuncture methods in treating lower limb motor dysfunction after stroke remains controversial. OBJECTIVE: In this paper, network meta-analysis (NMA) was used to prioritize various acupuncture intervention combinations commonly used in clinical practice, try to screen the acupuncture intervention scheme with the highest clinical efficacy and safety, and explore its rationality in guiding clinical practice. METHODS: We searched a total of 4,312 studies from 8 databases and 2 clinical trial registries, and selected 43 articles for systematic review. We used pairwise meta-analysis and network meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and ranking of various acupuncture interventions. At the same time, the risk of bias, publication bias, and sensitivity of included randomized controlled trials were analyzed. The main outcome indicator was Fugl-Meyer assessment of lower extremity (FMA-LE), and the secondary outcome indicators were Modified Barthel Index (MBI), Berg balance scale (BBS) and Modified Ashworth scale (MAS). RESULTS: A total of 4,134 patients in 43 studies were included. The intervention included 9 acupuncture-related treatments, of which 20.9% were classified as high-risk. Among the four outcome indicators in pairwise meta-analysis, the effect of body acupuncture combined with conventional rehabilitation has the highest comprehensive credibility in terms of efficacy and safety comparing with conventional rehabilitation [SMD = 1.14, 95%CI (0.81, 1.46)], [SMD = 1.35, 95%CI (0.97, 1.72)], [SMD = 1.22, 95%CI (0.39, 2.05)], [SMD = 1.21, 95%CI (0.74, 1.44)]. In addition, multiple intervention methods, for example, warm acupuncture plus rehabilitation treatment for MBI and electroacupuncture plus body acupuncture plus rehabilitation treatment for BBS, may increase certain additional effects on different outcome indicators. CONCLUSION: This study proves that body acupuncture combined with rehabilitation treatment is the most widely used intervention method with the highest evidence quality in the treatment of lower limb motor dysfunction after stroke. However, for some other acupuncture methods, large samples and high-quality clinical randomized controlled trials are still needed to be fully verified."
#4761,Therapeutic Effect of Catgut Implantation at Acupoint in a Mouse Model of Hepatocellular Carcinoma by Suppressing Immune Escape,"BACKGROUND: The occurrence and development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are closely related to immune function, as is the capacity of hepatoma cells to escape. Immunosurveillance is a key mechanism. Catgut implantation at acupoint (CIAA) is a promising acupuncture improvement method that can regulate immunity and has been widely used in the clinical treatment of a variety of diseases. The aim of this study is to observe the therapeutic effect of CIAA on HCC and to investigate the potential mechanism of immune escape. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 40 mice were randomly divided into three groups: the HCC model group (n = 15), the CIAA treatment group (n = 15), and the control group (n = 10). HCC was chemically induced in 30 mice by the combination of DEN, carbon tetrachloride, and ethanol for 150 days. Among them, 15 were selected for CIAA treatment to ascertain the therapeutic effect. The mRNA expression levels of AFP, IL-10, PD-1, and CTLA-4 in three groups were examined by using RT-PCR. AFP and AKT expressions were measured by using western blotting. PD1, CTLA-4, IL-10, CD4+, and CD8+ protein expression levels were evaluated by using IHC. The mortality rate, body weight, and psychological conditions of three groups were also compared. RESULTS: The mRNA and protein expression levels of AFP, PD-1, CTLA-4, and IL-10 were significantly downregulated in the CIAA-treated mice in comparison with HCC mice. IHC assay shows that CD4+ and CD8+ expression levels were notably upregulated after CIAA treatment. Western blotting assay shows that AKT pathway was deactivated in CIAA-treated mice. CIAA notably reduced the mortality rate and inhibited weight loss caused by HCC and improved the overall psychological condition of the mice. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our data corroborate the effective potency of CIAA in the treatment of HCC by and inhibiting immune escape and deactivating the AKT pathway."
#4776,Acupuncture versus valproic acid in the prophylaxis of migraine without aura: a prospective controlled study,"BACKGROUND: The pharmacologic treatment of migraine still remains below the expectations. The aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness of traditional acupuncture and valproic acid in migraine prophylaxis. METHODS: A prospective, controlled study was performed in 100 patients affected by migraine without aura lasting for over one year. The patients were stratified for sex and randomly divided into two groups of 50 patients each. Patients belonging to Group A (acupuncture) were submitted to 20 sessions of acupuncture, while patients belonging to Group V valproate) were administered Valproic acid (Depakin Chrono®) at a dose of 600 mg/day; 10 mg Rizatriptan wafers were allowed as needed to treat the attacks. The Midas Index (MI) and pain intensity (PI, by VAS) were recorded before treatment (T0), at three (T1) and six (T2) months; a six-point scale Pain Relief score (PRS), the Rizatriptan intake and adverse events were recorded at T1 and T2. RESULTS: Eighty-two out of 100 patients completed the study (9 dropouts in each group). In both groups the MI improved at T1 and T2 (P<0.0001). Pain intensity was better at T1 in group V (P<0.0001), but PI and PRS (P=0.02) as well as rizatriptan intake (P=0.001) were better in group A at T2. The rate of adverse events was 47.8% in group V and 0% in group A. CONCLUSION: Our data show a lower pain intensity and lower Rizatriptan intake at six-months follow-up with no adverse events in acupuncture patients compared to those treated with valproic acid."
#4807,Assessment of the information needs and use of information resources on complementary and alternative medicine by Alberta family physicians,"BACKGROUND: The public's increasing use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) poses unique challenges for primary care physicians in knowledge and patient communication. The objective of our study was to assess Alberta family physicians' interest in CAM information and the type of information sources they currently use. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was designed and mailed to a random sample of family physicians registered with the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Alberta. Main outcomes were physicians' self-reported knowledge of CAM, interest in CAM information and frequency of use of various medical information sources. RESULTS: Response rate was 34% (n = 346). Physicians indicated having limited knowledge of CAM, but were interested in evidence-based CAM information such as randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews on acupuncture, herbal medicine, massage, chiropractic treatment and meditation. Most respondents did not make use of reliable information sources that are available on the Internet. CONCLUSION: Education strategies are needed to help physicians access and use Internet sources of evidence-based CAM information more effectively."
#4875,Acupuncture in Pediatrics: A Scoping Review,"Background: The use of acupuncture for common pediatric conditions continues to grow in the United States. Six previous reviews have summarized the research; however, approximately 8 years have accumulated adding to this growing body of literature. Objectives: The aim of this article is to provide a scoping review of acupuncture research in pediatric conditions and a summary of the effectiveness of acupuncture in the pediatric population. Methods: A systematic search was performed to identify clinical trials and reviews published between August 2015 and October 2023. Trials and reviews were excluded if they were not: (1) acupuncture specific, (2) data limited to pediatric patients, and (3) published in English. The literature was assessed and synthesized into a scoping review and commentary. Results: Seventy-one publications were identified (42 clinical trials and 29 reviews) that represented 17 conditions and 10 countries; the top 2 were China and the United States. The top five areas of new research (based on numbers of clinical trials) are pain, cerebral palsy (CP), attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder, and nausea and vomiting. Conclusions: Clinical trials in pediatric acupuncture represent a small but important subset of acupuncture literature. Data are positive for postoperative nausea and vomiting and promising for CP, nocturnal enuresis, perioperative pain, procedural pain, and tic disorders. Several factors preclude additional firm conclusions from being drawn, including a limited number of trials, small sample size (n < 100) of the majority of randomized controlled trials (78.6%), and heterogeneity of treatment approaches. Continued research on the use of acupuncture for pediatric conditions is warranted, particularly in conditions demonstrating recent promising evidence."
#5001,Acupuncture for lateral elbow pain,"BACKGROUND: This review is one in a series of reviews of interventions for lateral elbow pain. Lateral elbow pain, or tennis elbow, is a common condition causing pain in the elbow and forearm and lack of strength and function of the elbow and wrist. Acupuncture has long been used to treat lateral elbow pain in China and in Western countries practitioners and consumers are increasingly exploring acupuncture as a first line treatment for musculoskeletal disorders. No previous systematic review of the available evidence has been conducted to determine whether acupuncture is efficacious in the treatment lateral elbow pain. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness of acupuncture in the treatment of adults with lateral elbow pain with respect to pain reduction, improvement in function, grip strength and adverse effects. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE and SCISEARCH and the Cochrane Clinical Trials Register and the Musculoskeletal Review Group's specialist trial database from 1966 to June 2001. Identified keywords and authors were searched in an effort to retrieve as many trials as possible. SELECTION CRITERIA: Two independent reviewers assessed all identified trials against pre-determined inclusion criteria. Randomised and pseudo randomised trials in all languages were included in the review provided they were testing acupuncture compared to placebo or another intervention in adults with lateral elbow pain (tennis elbow). Outcomes of interest were pain, function, disability, quality of life, strength, participant satisfaction with treatment and adverse effect. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: For continuous variables means and standard deviations were extracted or imputed to allow the analysis of weighted mean difference, while for binary data numbers of events and total population were analysed and interpreted as relative risks. Trial results were combined only in the absence of clinical and statistical heterogeneity. MAIN RESULTS: Four small randomized controlled trials were included but due to flaws in study designs (particularly small populations, uncertain allocation concealment and substantial loss to follow up) and clinical differences between trials, data from trials could not be combined in a meta-analysis. One randomised controlled trial found that needle acupuncture results in relief of pain for significantly longer than placebo (WMD = 18.8 hours, 95%CI 10.1 to 27.5) and is more likely to result in a 50% or greater reduction in pain after 1 treatment (RR 0.33, 95%CI 0.16 to 0.69) (Molsberger 1994). A second randomized controlled trial demonstrated needle acupuncture to be more likely to result in overall participant reported improvement than placebo in the short term (RR = 0.09 95% CI 0.01 to 0.64) (Haker 1990a). No significant differences were found in the longer term (after 3 or 12 months). A randomized controlled trial of laser acupuncture versus placebo demonstrated no differences between laser acupuncture and placebo with respect to overall benefit (Haker 1990b). A fourth included trial published in Chinese demonstrated no difference between Vitamin B12 injection plus acupuncture, and Vitamin B12 injection alone (Wang 1997). REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient evidence to either support or refute the use of acupuncture (either needle or laser) in the treatment of lateral elbow pain. This review has demonstrated needle acupuncture to be of short term benefit with respect to pain, but this finding is based on the results of 2 small trials, the results of which were not able to be combined in meta-analysis. No benefit lasting more than 24 hours following treatment has been demonstrated. No trial assessed or commented on potential adverse effect. Further trials, utilising appropriate methods and adequate sample sizes, are needed before conclusions can be drawn regarding the effect of acupuncture on tennis elbow."
#5015,"Effectiveness and safety of herbal medicine on treatment of dysmenorrhea: An analysis of a multicenter, prospective observational study","BACKGROUND: This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of individually prescribed decoction herbal medicine for the treatment of dysmenorrhea. Herbal decoction was compared to other herbal formulations and combined treatment modalities, focusing on reductions in menstrual pain intensity, duration, and analgesic use. Personalized herbal treatments were hypothesized to alleviate symptoms more effectively by addressing individual constitutional imbalances. METHODS: This prospective observational study was conducted at 33 Korean medicine clinics and one Korean medicine hospital in South Korea, enrolling 135 participants. Based on the treatment they received, participants were categorized into three groups: herbal decoction only group (Decoction only Group, n = 82), herbal decoction with adjunctive therapies such as acupuncture or moxibustion (Combination Group, n = 37), and non-herbal decoction formulations (Non-decoction Group, n = 16). Treatments were administered over at least one menstrual cycle, and outcomes were assessed after each cycle. Primary outcomes included changes in pain intensity (numerical rating scale), duration of menstrual pain, and frequency of analgesic use. Safety was assessed through adverse event monitoring during clinic visits. RESULTS: Herbal decoction only showed significant reductions in menstrual pain intensity, pain duration, and analgesic use compared to those receiving other herbal formulations. Most adverse events were mild gastrointestinal symptoms related to oral intake, which resolved without intervention. No serious adverse events were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Herbal decoction group significantly decreased the intensity and duration of menstrual pain and analgesic dosage. These findings suggest that herbal decoction may be a safe and effective personalized treatment option for dysmenorrhea."
#5027,"Combined spinal-epidural anesthesia with acupoint injection for labor anesthesia reduces IL-1β/IL-10 ratio in maternal peripheral blood, umbilical cord blood and improves the labor outcomes: A prospective randomized controlled trial","BACKGROUND: This study aimed to investigate the effects of combined spinal-epidural anesthesia (CSEA) with acupoint injection (AI) on the maternal-fetal expression of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-10 (IL-10), analgesia effect, and labor outcomes. METHODS: A total of 360 healthy primiparas were randomized into the CSEA+AI group, the CSEA group, the AI group, and the control group (n = 90, each group) according to the labor analgesia methods. RESULTS: Compared to the CSEA group, the CSEA+AI group had significantly lower visual analog scale (VAS) scores, adverse events, dose of ropivacaine/sufentanil, and shorter labor durations. The IL-1β/IL-10 ratio in maternal peripheral blood and umbilical cord blood was reduced in the CSEA+AI group compared with the CSEA group. CONCLUSION: The combination of CSEA and AI can reduce the ratio of IL-1β/ IL-10 in maternal peripheral blood and umbilical cord blood, which can effectively relieve labor pain."

#5214,Effects of conventional nursing in the operating room combined with transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation on postoperative cognitive dysfunction after total knee arthroplasty in elderly patients,"BACKGROUND: To observe the effects of conventional theatre nursing combined with transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation (TEAS) on postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) in elderly total knee arthroplasty (TKA) patients. METHODS: Forty elderly TKA patients were randomly divided into a conventional nursing (control) group and a TEAS group. Using conventional nursing, TEAS was used to stimulate the ""Zusanli"" and ""Sanyinjiao"" in the healthy leg of patients in the TEAS group. All patients received mini-mental (MMSE) scores 1 day before surgery (T0) and 1, 3, and 7 days after surgery (T1, T3, T7). Plasma levels of interleukin-1 (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α), and S100β were measured using venous blood samples. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in baseline clinical characteristics between the two groups. Compared to T0, the MMSE scores of patients in the control group were significantly reduced at T1 and T3 (P < 0.05). Compared to the control group, the MMSE scores of patients in the TEAS group increased significantly at T3 (P < 0.05). The incidence of POCD in the TEAS group was 10%, lower than in the control group (40%) (P < 0.05). The levels of IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α and S-100β in patients in the TEAS group were lower than in the control group on days T1, T3 and T7 (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Conventional intraoperative nursing combined with TEAS can reduce the incidence of POCD. The possible mechanism is related to the reduction of inflammatory response and neuronal injury with TEAS. CLINICAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ChiCTR2300070281."
#5346,Ultrasound-guided percutaneous needle electrolysis in chronic lateral epicondylitis: short-term and long-term results,"BACKGROUND: Ultrasound (US)-guided percutaneous needle electrolysis (PNE) is a novel minimally invasive approach which consists of the application of a galvanic current through an acupuncture needle. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical and ultrasonographic effectiveness of a multimodal programme (PNE, eccentric exercise (EccEx) and stretching) in the short term for patients with chronic lateral epicondylitis, and to determine whether the clinical outcomes achieved decline over time. METHODS: A one-way repeated measures study was performed in a clinical setting in 36 patients presenting with lateral epicondylitis. The patients received one session of US-guided PNE per week over 4-6 weeks, associated with a home programme of EccEx and stretching. The main outcome measures were severity of pain, disability (Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire), structural tendon changes (US), hypervascularity and patients' perceptions of overall outcome. Measurements at 6, 26 and 52 weeks follow-up included recurrence rates (increase in severity of pain or disability compared with discharge), perception of overall outcome and success rates. RESULTS: All outcome measures registered significant improvements between pre-intervention and discharge. Most patients (n=30, 83.3%) rated the overall outcome as 'successful' at 6 weeks. The ultrasonographic findings showed that the hypoechoic regions and hypervascularity of the extensor carpi radialis brevis changed significantly. At 26 and 52 weeks, all participants (n=32) perceived a 'successful' outcome. Recurrence rates were null after discharge and at follow-up at 6, 26 and 52 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Symptoms and degenerative structural changes of chronic lateral epicondylitis are reduced after US-guided PNE associated with EccEx and stretching, with encouragingly low recurrences in the mid to long term.

#5358,"Effects of acupuncture synchronized rehabilitation therapy on upper limb motor and sensory function after stroke: a study protocol for a single-center, 2 × 2 factorial design, randomized controlled trial","BACKGROUND: Upper limb function reconstruction has been an important issue in the field of stroke rehabilitation. Due to the complexity of upper extremity dysfunction in stroke patients, the clinical efficacy produced by central or peripheral stimulation alone is limited. For this reason, our group has proposed acupuncture synchronized rehabilitation therapy (ASRT), i.e., simultaneous scalp acupuncture and intradermal acupuncture during rehabilitation. Pre-experiments results showed that this therapy can effectively improve the motor and sensory functions of upper limbs in post-stroke patients, but the clinical efficacy and safety of ASRT need to be further verified, and whether there is a synergistic effect between scalp acupuncture and intradermal acupuncture also needs to be studied in depth. Therefore, we designed a randomized controlled trial to compare the efficacy and safety of different therapies to explore a more scientific ""synchronous treatment model."" METHODS: This is a single-center, randomized controlled trial using a 2 × 2 factorial design. We will recruit 136 stroke survivors with upper extremity dysfunction and randomize them into four groups (n = 34). All subjects will undergo routine treatment, based on which the Experimental Group 1: rehabilitation training synchronized with intradermal acupuncture treatment of the affected upper limb; Experimental Group 2: rehabilitation training of the affected upper limb synchronized with focal-side scalp acupuncture treatment, and Experimental Group 3: rehabilitation training synchronized with intradermal acupuncture treatment of the affected upper limb synchronized with focal-side scalp acupuncture treatment; Control Group: rehabilitation training of the affected upper limb only. The intervention will last for 4 weeks, 5 times a week. Both acupuncture treatments will be performed according to the Revised Standards for Reporting Interventions in Clinical Trials of Acupuncture (STRICTA). The primary outcome indicators for this trial are Fugl-Meyer Assessment-Upper Extremity and Somatosensory Evoked Potential. Secondary outcome indicators include Wolf Motor Function Test, Upper Extremity Function Test, revised Nottingham Sensory Assessment Scale, Diffusion Tensor Imaging, and Modified Barthel Index. The incidence of adverse events will be used as the indicator of safety. DISCUSSION: The study will provide high-quality clinical evidence on whether ASRT improves upper limb motor and sensory function and activities of daily living (ADL) in stroke patients, and determine whether scalp acupuncture and intradermal acupuncture have synergistic effects.

#5407,Efficacy of electrical acupuncture on vascular cognitive impairment with no dementia: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Vascular cognitive impairment with no dementia (VCIND), manifested mainly as mild impairment of concentration and executive function, is the early phase of vascular dementia (VD). Currently, there is no specific treatment for VCIND. We hypothesize that electrical acupuncture can improve the mental and motor functions of patients with VCIND. Thus, we designed this randomized controlled trial to test this hypothesis by comparing the therapeutic effect of electrical acupuncture versus sham acupuncture in patients with VCIND. METHOD/DESIGN: In this single-center 3-year study, 120 eligible patients will be recruited and randomly assigned to receive electrical acupuncture treatment (n = 60) or sham acupuncture (n = 60) for 8 consecutive weeks (24 sessions in total), with the same acupoint prescription (DU20, EX-HN3, DU24, DU17, DU26, EX-HN1, HT7, PC6, GB20, SP6). The primary assessment is the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. The secondary assessments are the Modified Barthel Index and Event-Related Potential. All outcomes will be assessed at baseline, endpoint, and follow-up at 8 and 24 weeks after the end of treatment. DISCUSSION: If the outcome confirms the effectiveness and safety of electrical acupuncture in treating VCIND, this treatment is expected to be promoted in clinical practice to treat such patients.

#5428,Protocol for double-blind RCT of acupuncture for vulvodynia,"BACKGROUND: Vulvodynia, vulvar pain of unknown origin lasting at least 3 months, affects 7% of American women. Dyspareunia, its frequent companion, renders sexual intercourse virtually impossible. Although few therapies are efficacious and rapid pain relief is rarely possible, there have been no sham/placebo-controlled studies of acupuncture for vulvodynia. Aims are to: 1) determine efficacy of acupuncture for vulvodynia, 2) explore duration of the acupuncture effect. METHODS: In a pretest/posttest randomized controlled, double-blind (practitioner-patient) efficacy trial of a standardized acupuncture protocol, we will randomize 80 participants 1:1 to either penetrating needle or skin-touch placebo needle groups. Both types of needles are designed to blind both the acupuncturist and participant. Participants with vulvodynia will insert and remove a tampon as a standardized stimulus and complete primary measures of vulvar pain (pain intensity) and secondary measures of dyspareunia (Female Sexual Function Index, FSFI dyspareunia subscale score) and sexual function (FSFI total score) pretreatment, after the 10th acupuncture session, and pain measures weekly until return to pretest levels. Upon study completion control group participants will be offered 10 free real acupuncture sessions. DISCUSSION: This is the first multi-needle multi-session RCT using double-blind acupuncture needles as a reliable sham. We hypothesize that controlling for baseline, at posttest there will be statistically significant less vulvar pain and dyspareunia and more sexual function over five weeks in the penetrating needle group compared to the skin touch placebo group. CONCLUSION: This study is responsive to the need for efficacious pain management for women with vulvodynia.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03364127."
#5497,Electroacupuncture alleviates corpus callosum injury in rats with ischemic stroke by inhibiting excessive activation of astrocytes and overexpression of connexin 43,"BACKGROUND: White matter injury is a critical pathological characteristic of ischemic stroke. Connexin 43 (Cx43), the dominant connexin protein in astrocytes, has recently been identified as a therapeutic target for ischemic stroke. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the neuroprotective effects of electroacupuncture (EA) against ischemic brain injury in rats by modulating Cx43. METHODS: An ischemic stroke model was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats by permanent occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (pMCAO). Rats were randomly assigned to four groups: sham, pMCAO, pMCAO + EA, and pMCAO + sham EA. The neurological severity score test was used to assess neurological deficits. Damage to the corpus callosum (CC) was evaluated using hematoxylin staining. The expression of Cx43 and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was measured using western blotting and immunohistochemistry. The expression of inflammatory factors, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-4, was assessed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: EA treatment significantly improved neurological function and reduced white matter injury. Furthermore, EA treatment notably downregulated the expression of Cx43 and GFAP in the CC. In addition, EA reduced TNF-α expression and increased IL-4 expression in the CC. CONCLUSION: EA treatment can alleviate white matter damage in rats with ischemic stroke, potentially through the inhibition of GFAP and Cx43 overexpression, thereby regulating the release of inflammatory factors."
#5509,"Effects of externally-applied, non-pharmacological Interventions on short- and long-term symptoms and inflammatory cytokine levels in patients with knee osteoarthritis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis","BACKGROUND: With the continuous development of clinical medicine, an increasing number of non-pharmacological interventions have been applied for the treatment of knee osteoarthritis (KOA), with the results of several recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) showing that a variety of externally-applied, non-pharmacological interventions (EANPI) can improve symptoms and inflammation in patients with KOA. However, the relative benefits and disadvantages of non-drug therapies remain uncertain, and an optimal treatment strategy has not yet been determined. OBJECTIVE: This study applied network meta-analysis (NMA) to compare and rank the effectiveness of EANPI on the short- and long-term clinical symptoms and inflammatory cytokine levels in patients with KOA. METHODS: Two independent researchers searched online databases and performed manual retrieval of related citations to identify RCTs that met the selection criteria for the network meta-analysis. These researchers retrieved studies indexed from database inception to August 2023 and performed data extraction and assessment of the risk of bias. RESULTS: The analysis included 80 RCTs involving 8440 participants and nine externally-applied, non-pharmacological therapies, namely extracorporeal shock wave, radiofrequency, acupotomy, laser therapy, Tuina therapy, kinesio taping, electroacupuncture, platelet-rich plasma injection, and ozone therapy. The treatment courses ranged from 1 to 12 weeks, with follow-up periods ranging from 4 to 24 weeks. The results of the NMA indicated that each non-drug therapy was superior to sham intervention in improving all outcome indicators. Except for the visual analog scale (VAS) and Western Ontario MacMaster (WOMAC) pain outcomes, all non-drug therapies had better efficacy than pharmacological treatments. For short-term VAS and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), extracorporeal shock wave performed better than other therapies (90.2% and 85.2% respectively). Radiofrequency therapy may be the most promising method to reduce long-term VAS, short- and long-term WOMAC pain, and interleukin (IL)-1β level (84.8%, 97.8%, 90.1%, 94.8% respectively). Tuina therapy may be a significant choice for short- and long-term outcomes of WOMAC function and range of motion (ROM). CONCLUSIONS: The results of the comprehensive comparison of the outcome indicators in 9 different EANPI indicated that radiofrequency and Tuina therapy were more effective and consistently ranked high in improving clinical symptoms in the short and long term. Radiofrequency is effective at relieving pain, and Tuina therapy can be given priority for treatment when hypofunction is the main symptom. EANPI to improve pain symptoms may be related to the regulation of inflammatory cytokine levels, which may be a potential mechanism of action.

#5565,An Overview of Bee Venom Acupuncture in the Treatment of Arthritis,"Bee venom acupuncture (BVA), as a kind of herbal acupuncture, exerts not only pharmacological actions from the bioactive compounds isolated from bee venom but also a mechanical function from acupuncture stimulation. BVA is growing in popularity, especially in Korea, and is used primarily for pain relief in many kinds of diseases. We aimed to summarize and evaluate the available evidence of BVA for rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. Computerized literature searches for experimental studies and clinical trials of BVA for arthritis were performed on the databases from PUBMED, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library. In addition, two leading Korean journals (The Journal of Korean Society for Acupuncture and Moxibustion and The Journal of Korean Oriental Medicine) were searched for relevant studies. The search revealed 67 studies, 15 of which met our criteria. The anti-inflammation and analgesic actions of BVA were proved in various kinds of animal arthritic models. Two randomized controlled trials and three uncontrolled clinical trials showed that BVA was effective in the treatment of arthritis. It is highly likely that the effectiveness of BVA for arthritis is a promising area of future research. However, there is limited evidence demonstrating the efficacy of BVA in arthritis. Rigorous trials with large sample size and adequate design are needed to define the role of BVA for these indications. In addition, studies on the optimal dosage and concentration of BVA are recommended for future trials."
#5567,Adverse Events Associated with the Clinical Use of Bee Venom: A Review,"Bee venom is used to treat various diseases but can cause a tickling sensation and anaphylaxis during clinical treatment. Adverse events (AEs) associated with bee venom may vary depending on the dosage, method, route of administration, and the country, region, and user. We summarized the AEs of bee venom used in various ways, such as by the injection of extracts, venom immunotherapy (VIT), live bee stings, or external preparations. We conducted a search in eight databases up to 28 February 2022. It took one month to set the topic and about 2 weeks to set the search terms and the search formula. We conducted a search in advance on 21 February to see if there were omissions in the search terms and whether the search formula was correct. There were no restrictions on the language or bee venom method used and diseases treated. However, natural stings that were not used for treatment were excluded. A total of 105 studies were selected, of which 67, 26, 8, and 4 were on the injection of extracts, VIT, live bee stings, and external preparation, respectively. Sixty-three studies accurately described AEs, while 42 did not report AEs. Thirty-five randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were evaluated for the risk of bias, and most of the studies had low significance. A large-scale clinical RCT that evaluates results based on objective criteria is needed. Strict criteria are needed for the reporting of AEs associated with bee venom."
#5588,Effectiveness of CAM therapy: understanding the evidence,"By definition, complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) attempts to diagnose and treat illnesses in unconventional ways. CAM has been classified as: (1) alternative medical systems (eg, traditional Chinese medicine [including acupuncture], naturopathic medicine, ayurvedic medicine, and homeopathy); (2) biologic-based therapies (eg, herbal, special dietary, and individual biologic treatments); (3) energy therapies (eg, Reiki, therapeutic touch, magnet therapy, Qi Gong, and intercessory prayer); (4) manipulative and body-based systems (eg, chiropractic, osteopathy, and massage); and (5) mind-body interventions (eg, meditation, biofeedback, hypnotherapy, and the relaxation response). This review focuses on how to assess the effectiveness of CAM therapies for chronic musculoskeletal pains, emphasizing the role of specific and nonspecific analgesic mechanisms, including placebo."
#5603,Integrative Medicine for Cancer-Related Pain: A Narrative Review,"Cancer-related pain (C-RP) is a prevalent and debilitating concern among patients with cancer, with conventional treatments limited in their ability to provide adequate relief, and by the adverse effects associated with their use. Complementary and integrative medicine (CIM) modalities have been shown to be potentially effective and safe for the treatment of pain and related symptoms, when used in conjunction with conventional medications and under medical supervision. An increasing number of oncology centers provide CIM within their conventional supportive and palliative care service, in an ""Integrative Oncology"" (IO) setting. A large body of clinical research, including systematic reviews and guidelines such as those published in 2022 by the Society for Integrative Oncology (SIO), in collaboration with the American Society for Clinical Oncology (ASCO), support the use of some CIM modalities for C-RP and related concerns. These include acupuncture for general and peri-operative/procedural pain, as well as aromatase inhibitor-associated arthralgia (AIA); reflexology or acupressure for pain during systemic therapy for cancer; hypnosis for procedural pain or pain due to diagnostic workup; and massage for pain experienced by patients during palliative and hospice care. Further research is needed, within both randomized control trials and pragmatic non-controlled studies which are more reflective of the real-life IO setting. This review summarizes the evidence supporting the use of CIM for C-RP; the analgesic mechanism of the modalities presented; and the challenges facing IO researchers, as well as the implementation of the 2022 SIO-ASCO guideline recommendations."
#5618,Electroacupuncture Improves Cerebral Vasospasm and Functional Outcome of Patients With Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage,"Cerebral vasospasm is the major cause of a poor outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH), and effective treatments for vasospasm are limited. The purpose of this study was to research the impact of electroacupuncture (EA) on cerebral vasospasm and the outcomes of patients with aSAH. A total of 60 age- and sex-matched aSAH patients were collected from Ningbo First Hospital between December 2015 and June 2017. All patients were given a basic treatment of nimodipine and randomized into two groups. The study group was treated with EA therapy on the Baihui (GV20) acupoint, and the control group was given mock transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation. Cerebral vasospasm was measured by computed tomographic perfusion (CTP) and transcranial doppler (TCD). The mean flow velocity (MFV) in the middle cerebral artery (MCA), cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV), and mean transit time (MTT) of the patients were analyzed. The CBV and MTT exhibited significant differences between the study and control groups on the 1st (p = 0.026 and p = 0.001), 7th (p = 0.020 and p < 0.001), and 14th (p = 0.001 and p < 0.001) day after surgery, whereas CBF exhibited statistical significance only on the 14th day after surgery (p = 0.002). The MFV in MCA were significantly reduced after EA treatment in all patients (all p < 0.001). Additionally, the MFV in the MCA in patients treated with EA were considerably reduced compared with those of the control group (3rd day p = 0.046; 5th day, p = 0.010; 7th day, p < 0.001). Moreover, better outcomes were noted in the EA-treated group for the 1st month (p < 0.001) and 3rd month (p = 0.001) after surgery than in the control group. In conclusion, EA represents a potential method to treat cerebral vasospasm after aSAH and can improve the outcomes of patients with aSAH."
#5658,The therapeutic effects of acupuncture on patients with chronic neck myofascial pain syndrome: a single-blind randomized controlled trial,"Chronic neck myofascial pain syndrome (MPS) is a common disorder seen in clinics. There is no gold standard method to treat myofascial pain. We investigated the effects of acupuncture on patients with chronic neck MPS by a single-blind randomized controlled trial. A total of 35 patients were randomly allocated to an acupuncture group (AG) or a sham acupuncture group (SG). Each subject received acupuncture treatment twice per week for three consecutive weeks. The primary outcome measure was quality of life as assessed with Short Form-36, and secondary outcome measures were neck range of motion (ROM), motion-related pain, and Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ), as determined by a blinded investigator. The clinical assessments were made before treatment (BT) and after six acupuncture treatments (AT), as well as four weeks (F1) and 12 weeks (F2) after the end of the treatment. A total of 34 patients completed the trial. The results indicated that there is no significant difference in the ROM, motion-related pain, and SF-MPQ scores between AG and SG at AT, F1 and F2 (all p > 0.05). However, AG has greater improvement in physical functioning and role emotional of Short Form-36 quality of life at F2. The results indicate that acupuncture may be used to improve the quality of life in patients with chronic neck MPS."
#5793,Evaluation of acupressure effects on self-efficacy and pregnancy rate in infertile women under in vitro fertilization/intracytoplasmic sperm injection treatment: A randomized controlled trial,"CONTEXT: Infertility is one of the major stressful events in individual life, especially women. Self-efficacy means a person can perceive a potentially threatening and stressful situation as being amenable to influences of personal control. AIMS: This study was conducted to determine the acupressure effects on self-efficacy and pregnancy rate in infertile women under in vitro fertilization (IVF)/intracytoplasmic sperm injection treatment. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: This study was a randomized controlled trial in infertile women. It performed at Milad IVF Center, Mashhad, Iran, from September 2015 to August 2016. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The sample size was 144 participants. The participants were randomly divided into three groups: real and sham acupressure and control groups. Acupressure performed on the H7 and P6 acupoints on both the hands. The infertility self-efficacy scale was completed before and after intervention. Beta-human chorionic gonadotropin hormone assay was measured to determine pregnancy. Data analysis was done by Chi-square, Fisher's exact, paired sample t, Kruskal-Wallis, and ANOVA test and general linear model and multinomial logistic. Levels of significance were reported at P < 0.05. RESULTS: The mean age of women was 30.84 ± 5.34 years. The ovulation factor (P = 0.02) and spouse's job (P = 0.05) were statistically significant difference between the groups. The score of self-efficacy and frequency of clinical pregnancy were no significant difference among three groups. Using linear regression, only the score of primary self-efficacy (before intervention) was in a significant relationship with self-efficacy after the intervention (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: To our results, we recommend more research for assessing acupressure effects on self-efficacy and clinical pregnancy rate in infertile women."
#5854,Phase II Randomized Trial of Acupuncture-Like Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation to Prevent Radiation-Induced Xerostomia in Head and Neck Cancer Patients,"Current evidence indicates that acupuncture-like transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (ALTENS) can provide sustained benefit for established radiation-induced xerostomia (RIX) symptoms. This is further being evaluated by comparing it with standard treatment (pilocarpine) in a randomized controlled trial. This report studies the potential effectiveness of xerostomia prevention using ALTENS delivered concomitantly with radiotherapy administered to head and neck cancer patients. Sixty patients were randomized to either the treatment group (n = 30) that received ALTENS daily with radiotherapy or the control group (n = 26) that had standard mouth care only. Stimulated and basal unstimulated whole saliva production (WSP) plus RIX symptoms visual analogue score (RIXVAS) were assessed at specific time points. Generalized linear models and generalized estimating equations were used for analysis. RIXVAS at 3 months follow-up after therapy completion was used as the primary study endpoint. The mean RIXVAS for the ALTENS intervention at 3 months was 39.8, which was not significantly different from the control arm value of 40.5. There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups for their mean RIXVAS and WSP at all assessment time points. In conclusion, there was no significant difference in mean WSP and RIXVAS between the two groups, so ALTENS is not recommended as a prophylactic intervention."
#5884,Complementary therapies for depression: an overview,"Depression is one of the most common reasons for using complementary and alternative therapies. The aim of this article is to provide an overview of the evidence available on the treatment of depression with complementary therapies. Systematic literature searches were performed using several databases, reference list searching, and inquiry to colleagues. Data extraction followed a predefined protocol. The amount of rigorous scientific data to support the efficacy of complementary therapies in the treatment of depression is extremely limited. The areas with the most evidence for beneficial effects are exercise, herbal therapy (Hypericum perforatum), and, to a lesser extent, acupuncture and relaxation therapies. There is a need for further research involving randomized controlled trials into the efficacy of complementary and alternative therapies in the treatment of depression."
#5967,[Effect of mild-warm moxibustion on microcirculation in the raw surface tissue of chronic refractory wound in skin ulcer rats],"OBJECTIVE: To observe the effects of mild-warm moxibustion on dynamic blood flow, microvessel count (MVC)and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in the wound tissue of the chronic skin ulcer in rats, so as to reveal its underlying mechanism in promoting wound recovery. METHODS: A total of 104 male SD rats with skin injury were randomly divided into control group (n=8), model group (n=32), TDP (far-infrared heating device) group (n=32) and moxibustion group (n=32). Chronic refractory raw surface wound model was established by muscular injection of Hydrocortisone Sodium Succinate. For rats of the TDP and moxibustion groups, TDP irridiation and mild-warm moxibustion were applied to the raw surface, bilateral ""Shenshu"" (BL 23) and ""Zusanli"" (ST 36) for 15 min, once daily for 3, 7 and 14 days respectively. The healing rate and the healing time of raw surface of the wound were observed. The blood flow of the raw surface of the wound tissue was measured by laser Doppler flowmeter and the MVC in granulation tissue of chronic skin ulcer was counted under light microscope. VEGF expression was detected by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: In comparison with the control group, the healing rate of the wound raw surface was significantly lower and the healing time was prolonged in the model group (P < 0.01). Compared with the model group, the healing rates on day 3, 7, 10 and 14 were significantly higher and the healing time was strikingly faster in both TDP and moxibustion groups (P < 0.01, P < 0.05), and the effects of the moxibustion group in increasing the healing rate and shortening the healing time were significantly better than those of TDP group (P < 0.01). In comparison with the model group, the blood flow volume, MVC and VEGF expression levels on day 3 and 7 were upregulated significantly in both TDP and moxibustion groups (P < 0.01, P < 0.05); while the blood flow volume, MVC and VEGF expression level in the moxibustion group and the blood flow volume and VEGF expression level in the TDP group downregulated considerably on day 14 (P < 0.01). No significant difference was found between the TDP and moxibustion groups in the MVC on day 14 after the treatment (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Mild-warm moxibustion can promote wound healing, which is closely with its effects in increasing blood flow and MVC, and upregulating VEGF expression in the wound granulation tissue of the chronic skin ulcer."
#6078,[Clinical observation of preventing and treating constipation by electroacupuncture intervention in ischemic stroke patients at acute stage],"OBJECTIVE: To observe the efficacy of preventing constipation by electroacupuncture intervention in ischemic stroke patients at acute stage. METHODS: Three hundred and forty ischemic stroke patients who matched the inclusive criteria were randomly divided into an electroacupuncture (EA) group and a routine treatment group, 170 cases in each one. In the EA group, based on routine western treatment, rehabilitation training and common acupuncture, Tianshu (ST 25) and Zusanli (ST 36) were selected and connected to SDZ-V Hwato brand electric acupuncture apparatus respectively, given stimulation of dense-disperse wave (10 Hz/50 Hz) with electric current of 0.1 to 1.0 mA, once every day and 5 times a week in the first 2 weeks, 2 times a week in the latter 2 weeks. In the routine treatment group, only basic treatment was applied. In the two groups, the course of treatment was 4 weeks and 8 weeks' follow-up was required after treatment. The actual numbers who independently defecated less than 3 times a week after 1 to 4 weeks' treatment and in the 4th and the 8th weeks' follow-up and condition taking laxative medicines during the 12 weeks in the two groups were observed and compared. RESULTS: Compared on the numbers of constipation cases after 1 to 4 weeks' treatment, those in the EA group were all less than those in the routine treatment group [24.7% (42/170) vs. 36.5%(62/170), 18.8% (32/170) vs. 30.6% (52/170), 10.5% (17/162) vs. 27.5% (44/160), 9.3% (15/162) vs. 19.4% (31/160),P<0.05, P<0.001]. In the 4th and the 8th weeks' follow-up, numbers in the EA group were still less than those in the routine treatment group [9.0% (14/156) vs. 18.1% (28/155), 7.7% (12/155) vs. 16.9 (26/154) both P<0.05)]. During the 12 weeks, the number of cases who took laxative medicines in the EA group was less than that in the routine treatment group [21.2% (36/170) vs. 34.7% (59/170), P<0.05]. CONCLUSION: There is clinical significance to electroacupuncture at Tian-shui (ST 25) and Zusanli (ST 36) coibined with basic comprehensive treatment for preventing and treating constipation symptom in ischemic stroke acute stage."
#6083,[Efficacy Observation of Ultrasonic Conductometric Acupoint Penetration of Wenhua Zhitong Recipe for Adenomyosis Patients],"OBJECTIVE: To observe the efficacy of ultrasonic conductometric acupoint penetration of Wenhua Zhitong Recipe (WZR) in treating adenomyosis. METHODS: Totally 40 adenomyosis patients with Shen-deficiency blood stasis syndrome were randomly assigned to the treatment group and the control group, 20 in each group. Patients in the treatment group received ultrasonic conductometric acupoint penetration of WZR from the 2nd day before menstruation to the end of menstruation, while those in the control group took WZR. All patients received 3 consecutive menstrual cycles. Endometrial contents of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and oxytocin receptor (OTR) were determined using SP immunohistochemical staining method before and after treatment. Clinical effect, efficacy of Chinese medical syndrome, changes of uterus volume, and contents of carbohydrate antigen 125 (CA125) were observed before and after treatment. RESULTS: There was no statistical difference in the total clinical effect between the two groups (P = 0.357). Efficacies for relieving abdominal pain and lumbar soreness during menstruation were better in the treatment group than in the control group (P < 0.05). Uterus volume, endometrial levels and integrals of COX-2 and OTR decreased in the two groups after treatment (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Ultrasonic conductometric acupoint penetration of WZR and oral administration of WZR both could effectively improve adenomyosis patients' symptoms such as Shen deficiency, and blood stasis, reduce the foci of uterus, and relieve the pain."
#6098,[Impact of acupoint heat-sensitive moxibustion on lung function and life quality of patients with chronic persistent bronchial asthma: a randomized controlled study],"OBJECTIVE: To observe the impact of heat-sensitive moxibustion on lung function in chronic persistent bronchial asthma and analyze its effect on the improvement of life quality as well as compare its efficacy with Seretide inhaler. METHODS: Fifty-seven cases were divided into a heat-sensitive moxibustion group (28 cases) and a Seretide group (29 cases) according to the random number table. In heat-sensitive moxibustion group, the therapy of heat-sensitive moxibustion was applied to the regions at the level of Feishu (BL 13) and Geshu (BL 17), or to the heat-sensitized points in the region 6 cun lateral from the 1st and 2nd intercostal spaces in the chest. The treatment was given continuously for 8 days, once per day, 12 treatments should be ensured in the later 22 days of the 1st month. In the later two months since then, 15 treatments should be ensured each month (< or = 1 treatment each day). In Seretide group, Seritide manufactured in GlaxoSmithKLine was used, one inhalation each time, twice per day. The cases in both groups were received treatment for 3 months. The changes in lung function such as forced expiratory volume one second (FEV1), TCM symptoms score, Asthma Control Test (ACT) and St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) were assessed and compared between two groups and within group separately. RESULTS: Lung function as FEV1 was improved in either group (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). The terminal improvement effects on symptoms of Chinese medicine, life quality and others were same between two groups (all P > 0.05). But the improvements in general situation, chills, fever and sweating in heat-sensitive moxibustion group were superior to those in Seretide group (both P < 0.05). Concerning to the improvement in respiratory symptoms, the effect of Seretide was better than that of heat-sensitive moxibustion (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Heat-sensitive moxibustion improves lung function, relieves clinical symptoms and benefits life quality for patients with chronic persistent bronchial asthma. It's efficacy on the disease is equal to the internationally-recognized effect of Seretide."
#6129,[Impacts on repeated common cold for the adults with different constitutions treated by acupoint application in the dog days and the three nine-day periods after the winter solstice],"OBJECTIVE: To observe the impacts on repeated common cold for the adults with different constitutions treated by acupoint application in the dog days (the three periods of the hottest days) and the three nine-day periods after the winter solstice (the three periods of the coldest days). METHODS: One hundred and fifty-two cases of repeated common cold were divided into four zones according to the body constitution. Each zone was sub-divided into a group of the dog days + the three nine-day periods of the coldest days (group A), and a simple group of the dog periods (group B). In both groups, Dazhui (GV 14), Feishu (BL 13), Tiantu (CV 22), Danzhong (CV 17), Zhongfu (LU 1) and Shenshu (BL 23) were selected. In group A, the acupoint application was given on the 1st or 2nd day of the first, second and third periods of the hottest days in 2010, as well as the 1st or 2nd day of the first, second and third periods of the coldest days in 2010 separately. In group B, the acupoint application was only given on the 1st or 2nd day of the first, second and third periods of the hottest days in 2010. The follow-up visit was conducted before the acupoint application in the three periods of the coldest days in 2010 and before the acupoint application in the three periods of the hottest days in 2011. Additionally, the frequency of disease attack and the symptom score in sickness were taken as the observation indices for the efficacy assessment in both groups. RESULTS: (1) In both groups, the attack frequency was reduced obviously in half a year after the three periods of the hottest days for the patients of qi deficiency constitution, yang deficiency constitution and qi stagnation constitution and the clinical symptom score were reduced apparently (all P<0.01), which were superior to those for the patients of phlegm damp constitution (P<0.01, P<0.05). For the patients of phlegm damp constitution, only the clinical symptom score was reduced (P<0.01). (2) In group A, the improvements were received in the attack frequency and the clinical symptom score in half a year after the three periods of the coldest days for the patients of those four constitutions as compared with those before treatment (all P<0.01). In group B, the attack frequency and the clinical symptom score were all back to the level as those before treatment. (3) In group A, in half a year after the three periods of the coldest days, the efficacy for reducing the attack frequency and the improvements in the clinical symptoms were better than those in group B (all P<0.01). CONCLUSION: The acupoint application in the dog days and the three nine-day periods after the winter solstice reduces the attack frequency and relieves the clinical symptoms of common cold for the adults of individual constitutions to different extents. The efficacy can be further improved in the treatment with the acupoint application in the three nine-day periods after the winter solstice half a year after the acupoint application in the dog days."

METHODS: Eighty patients who were in compliance with the inclusive criteria were randomized into a conventional treatment group and a nape acupuncture group, 40 cases in each one, according to the admission sequence. In the conventional treatment group, on the basis of general medication, the rehabilitation training of swallowing function was applied. In the nape acupuncture group, on the basic treatment as the conventional treatment group, nape acupuncture group was given. RESULTS: After treatment, the improvements in bedside water swallowing test, SSA, VFSS and pharynx transit time were all superior to those before treatment for the patients in the two groups (all P < 0.05). The improvements in bedside water swallowing test, SSA, VFSS and pharynx transit time in the nape acupuncture group were all superior to those in the conventional treatment group (all P < 0.05). The total effective rate was 85.0% (34/40) in the nape acupuncture group, which was higher than 65.0% (26/40) in the conventional treatment group, indicating the significantly statistical difference between the two groups (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Nape acupuncture combined with rehabilitation training significantly improves swallowing function of the patients after stroke."
#6155,[Influence of different frequency electroacupuncture on serum IL-1 and IL-6 in patients with pneumonectomy],"OBJECTIVE: To observe the influence of acupuncture-drug compound anesthesia with different frequency electroacupuncture on cytokine expression in patients with pneumonectomy in order to provide evidence for selection of electroacupuncture frequency in acupuncture-drug compound anesthesia. METHODS: Fifty-six patients scheduled for pneumonectomy were randomly divided into groups I (n=22), II (n=16) and III (n=18). General anesthesia was produced in all the groups. The patients in group II and III were treated with electroacupuncture at Houxi (SI 3), Zhigou (TE 6), Neiguan (PC 6) and Hegu (LI 4), 30 min before general anesthesia. The 2 Hz continuous wave was produced in group II, and the 2 Hz/100 Hz was produced in group III till the operation finished. The serum content of interleukin 1 (IL-1) and 6 (IL-6) was detected by double antibody sandwich enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) at the time of 24 hours before operation, 10 minutes after incision and 24 hours after operation. RESULTS: The contents of IL-6 in all the three groups at the time of 10 minutes after incision were all higher than those before operation (all P < 0.01), and the content of IL-1 had no obvious change (all P > 0.05). In comparison with 10 minutes after incision, the contents of IL-1 in group I and III were both significantly increased at the time of 24 hours after operation (both P < 0.01), and there was no obvious change in group II (P > 0.05). The contents of IL-6 in all the three groups at the time of 24 hours after operation were more significantly increased than those at the time of 10 minutes after incision (all P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Acupuncture-drug compound anesthesia with 2 Hz frequency can partly regulate the expression of inflammatory factors so as to alleviate the stress reaction in perioperative patients and protect organs function."
#6170,[Influence of electroacupuncture stimulation of delivery-facilitating acupoints with different stimulating parameters on serum endocrine hormones of late-stage pregnant rats],"OBJECTIVE: To observe the influence of electroacupuncture (EA) stimulation of ""Hegu"" (LI 4) and ""Sanyinjiao""(SP 6; a classical delivery-facilitating acupoint recipe) at different parameters on endocrine hormone levels of late-stage pregnant rats, so as to find the better stimulation parameters for delivery facilitation. METHODS: Ninety-six female Wistar rats were randomly divided into eight groups: normal control (normal), pregnancy (model), EA-15 Hz, EA-30 Hz, EA-50 Hz, EA-2 Hz/ 15 Hz, EA-2 Hz/30 Hz and EA-2 Hz/50 Hz, with 12 rats in each group except EA-30 Hz group (n = 10). EA stimulation (0.2 to 0. 3 mA) was delivered to bilateral LI 4 for 20 min and then bilateral SP 6 for 5 min (25 min). The contents of serum estradiol (E2), progesterone (P) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) were detected by ELISA. RESULTS: Compared with the normal group, serum E2, P and PGE2 contents were significantly increased in the pregnancy model group (P<0.01), and E2/ P level was downregulated mildly (P>0.05). Compared with the model group, the contents of serum E2 in the EA-15 Hz, EA-30 Hz, EA-50 Hz, EA-2 Hz/15 Hz and EA-2 Hz/50 Hz groups, serum PGE2 contents in the EA-15 Hz, EA-30 Hz and EA-2 Hz/50 Hz groups, and E2/P levels in the EA-15 Hz, EA-30 Hz, EA-50 Hz and EA-2 Hz/50 Hz groups were significantly increased (P<0.01, P<0.05), whereas serum P contents in the EA-15 Hz, EA-30 Hz, EA-50 Hz and EA-2 Hz/50 Hz groups were significantly down-regulated (P<0. 01, P<0. 05). The effects of EA-2 Hz/50 Hz group were significantly superior to those of EA-2 Hz/15 Hz and EA-2 Hz/ 30 Hz groups in raising serum E2 and E2/P levels (P<0.05, P<0.01). No significant differences were found among the EA-15 Hz, EA-30 Hz, EA-50 Hz and EA-2 Hz/50 Hz groups in raising serum E2, PGE2 and E2/P levels, and among the EA-30 Hz, EA-50 Hz and EA-2 Hz/50 Hz groups in lowering serum P levels (P>0. 05). It displayed that the effects of EA at 15 Hz, 30 Hz and 2 Hz/50 Hz on the abovementioned 4 indexes were relatively better. CONCLUSION: EA of LI 4 and SP 6 at 15 Hz, 30 Hz and 2 Hz/ 50 Hz can effectively up-regulate serum E2, PGE2 and E2/P levels and down-regulate serum P content in pregnancy rats, which may contribute to its effect in promoting labor."
#6183,[Effect of electroacupuncture intervention on behavioral changes and hippocampal excitatory amino acid transporter mRNA expression in depression rats],"OBJECTIVE: To observe the influence of music-electroacupuncture (EA) and pulse EA on locomotor activity and hippocampal neuron numbers and excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs) mRNA expression in depression rats, so as to explore their mechanisms underlying improvement of depression in acupuncture clinic. METHOD: Sixty SD rats were randomly divided into blank control, depression model, medication, pulse EA and music-EA groups, with 12 rats in each group. Depression model was established by using chronic unpredictable mild stress protocols combined with solitary feeding. Rats of the medication group were treated by oral administration of fluoxetine (a standard antidepressant, 2 mg/kg). EA was applied to ""Baihui"" (GV 20) and ""Yintang"" (EX-HN 3) for 20 min, once a day for 21 days. The animals' ethological changes were detected by using field tests for recording the number of crossing squares and the number of rearing. The number of hippocampal neurons were calculated under microscope after Nissl's staining of the hippocampal tissue section. Hippocampal EAAT 1 and EAAT 2 mRNA expression levels were assayed by fluorescent quantitative real-time POR. RESULTS: In comparison with the blank control group, the numbers of crossing and rearing movements, as well as the expression levels of hippocampal EAAT 1 and EAAT 2 mRNA were significantly lower in the model group (P < 0.01), while compared with the model group, the numbers of both crossing and rearing movements of the medication, pulse EA and music-EA groups were obviously increased (P < 0.01). Correspondingly, the expression levels of hippocampal EAAT 1 and EAAT 2 mRNA were considerably upregulated in the pulse EA and music-EA groups in comparison with the model group (P < 0.01). No significant differences were found among the medication, pulse EA and music-EA groups (P > 0.05). Results of Nissl's staining displayed that in the model group, the hippocampal neurons were loose in arrangement and some of them were absent, but in the medication, pulse EA and music-EA groups, the neurons were clear in shape and lined in order. CONCLUSION: Both pulse EA and music-EA can effectively improve the locomotor activity and hippocampal neuronal structure in depression rats which may be closely associated with their effects in upregulating hippocampal EAAT 1 and EAAT 2 mRNA expression."

In the control group, the chest circumference, the SP and DP had no significant improvement (P>0.05), while the heart rate was significantly increased and the weight was significantly decreased (P<0.01). (2) The test group achieved significant positive changes in the performance status, state of mind and fatigue index (P<0.01 or P<0.05), while the control group only achieved a significant positive change in performance status (P<0.01), and a negative significant decrease in the autonomic nerve function (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Junior school students would get physiological and psychological benefit from practicing CTHE, and which is suitable for them to practice."
#6224,[Protecting action of acupuncture-drug compound anesthesia with different frequency electroacupuncture on stress reaction in pneumonectomy],"OBJECTIVE: To observe the protective effect of acupuncture-drug compound anesthesia with different frequency electroacupuncture on stress reaction in pneumonectomy and to explore potential mechanisms. METHODS: Eighty patients scheduled for pneumonectomy were randomly divided into four groups, named group A, B, C and D, 20 cases in each group. General anesthesia and single lung protective mechanical ventilation were produced in all the groups. They were treated with acupuncture at Houxi (SI 3), Zhigou (TE 6), Neiguan (PC 6), and Hegu (Li 4) 30 min before general anesthesia, and then with Han's acupoint nerve stimulator (HANS-200). The acupuncture needles without needle bodies were pasted on the acupoints and the electroacupuncture were not turned on in group A, and the 2 Hz continuous wave were produced in group B, and 100 Hz continuous wave were produced in group C and the 2 Hz/100 Hz were produced in group D. The supplementary anesthesia medicine during pneumonectomy, heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), CD4+ /CD/ in venous blood before and after the surgery, and the contents of epinephrine (E) and cortisol (Cor) in plasma at the time of inter-room and outer-room were detected. RESULTS: (1) The supplementary fentanyl in group B and C were lower than those in group A and D (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). (2) The MAP in the four groups at intratracheal intubation (T1) were all higher than those at before anesthesia (T0) (all P < 0.01), and the ascending extent in group B, C and D were lower than that in group A (all P < 0.01). The HR at T in group A was higher than that at T0 (P < 0.05) and there were no significant differences in the other groups (all P > 0.05), and the ascending extent in group B and D were lower than that in group A (both P < 0.05). The MAP and HR at the other moment in all the groups were maintained stable. (3) CD4+ /CD8+ in group A after pneumonectomy was lower than that before the surgery (P < 0.05), and there were no significant differences in the other groups (all P > 0.05). (4) The content of E and Cor after the surgery were all increased (all P < 0.01), and the ascending extent of E in group D was lower than that in group A (P < 0.05), and the ascending level of Cor in group B and D were lower than that in group A (P < 0.01) and group B compared with group C and D were got the same result. CONCLUSION: Acupuncture-drug compound anesthesia can attenuate the stress reaction so as to protect organs under the condition of less drug and can alleviates the undulate phenomenon of MAP and HR at intubation and stabilize CD4+ /CD8+ after pneumonectomy. Among them, the 2 Hz and 2 Hz/100 Hz electroacupuncture groups have the comparatively better effects."
#6309,[Deep acupuncture of Lianquan (CV23) and Yifeng (TE17) in combination with conventional acupuncture of other acupoints is superior to swallowing rehabilitation training in improving post-stroke dysphagia in apoplexy patients],"OBJECTIVE: To observe the therapeutic effect of acupuncture therapy in the treatment of dysphagia in apoplexy patients. METHODS: A total of 104 patients with post-stroke dysphagia were randomized into a control (conventional swallowing rehabilitation training) group and an acupuncture group (n＝ 52 cases in each one). In the control group, the conventional swallowing rehabilitation training was conducted, twice daily, 6 times a week for 4 weeks. In the acupuncture group, deep needling of main acupoints Lianquan (CV23) and Yifeng (TE17), and conventional acupuncture of adjuvant acupoints as Fengchi (GB20) and Fengfu (GV16), Wangu (GB12), Lieque (LU7), Jinjin (EX-HN12), Yuye (EX-HN13), etc. as well as electroacupuncture stimulation (15－20 Hz, 5 mA, and duration of 30 min) of ipsilateral CV23-GV16, TE17-GB20, and bilateral Neidaying acupoints were conducted. The acupuncture treatment was given once daily, 6 times a week for consecutive 4 weeks. In addition, patients of the two groups also received routine symptomatic treatment with drugs for anti-platelet aggregation, nourishing cranial nerve, lowering blood pressure, controlling blood glucose, improving cerebral circulation, etc. Before and after the treatment, the standard swallowing assessment (SSA, 18－46 points) and Kubota water swallowing test (WST, 1－5 grades) were conducted to evaluate the patient's swallowing function. The comprehensive therapeutic effect was assessed in accordance with the SSA and Kubota WST, and adverse reactions were recorded. RESULTS: After the treatment, the SSA score was considerably reduced in the two groups relevant to their own pre-treatment (both P<0.05), and was significantly lower in the acupuncture group than in the control group (P<0.05). The Kubota WST grade was evidently increased in the number of patients with grade Ⅰ (P<0.05) and reduced in the numbers of patients with grade Ⅲ－Ⅴ in both groups relevant to their own pre-treatment, and was more patients with grade Ⅰ in the acupuncture group than in the control group (P<0.05). Outcomes of the comprehensive therapeutic effect indicated that of the two 52 cases in the control and acupuncture groups, 8 (15.38%) and 19 (36.53%) were cured, 7 (13.46%) and 15 (28.45%) had marked improvement, 17 (32.69%) and 12 (23.08%) were effective, and 20 (38.46%) and 6 (11.54%) failed in the treatment, with the effective rate being 61.54% and 88.46%, respectively. The total effective rate of the acupuncture group was significantly higher than that of the control group (P<0.05). The adverse reactions such as regional hematoma (in 3 cases) and pain (in 2 cases) in the acupuncture group, and choking-coughing in the control group were seen, being 9.62% and 11.54% in the incidence rate, respectively. CONCLUSION: Deep needling of main acupoints Lianquan (CV23) and Yifeng (TE 17) in combination with conventional acupuncture of other acupoints is effective in improving local glossopharyngeal function in apoplexy patients with dysphagia, which is obviously superior to conventional swallowing rehabilitation training in the therapeutic effect and is applicable in clinical practice."

#6601,Effectiveness of moxibustion for exercise-induced fatigue--a systematic review for randomized controlled trials,"OBJECTIVE: To review and assess the effect of single moxibustion for exercise-induced fatigue: (EIF). METHODS: Computer-search for 8 medical databases and 5 clinical trail registries were conducted for: randomized controlled trials (RCTs), added with hand-search for 10 Chinese acupuncture-moxibustion journals and additional references. Data from included RCTs were pooled by RevMan5.1. Methodology quality of RCTs was judged by Cochrane Collaboration assessment tool while quality of primary outcomes was evaluated by GRADE3.2. RESULTS: Five RCTs were finally included, all reported in small sample size with high risk of: bias. Comparisons on single moxibustion and rest relief (without treatment) were studied. Six outcomes were reported, all favored moxibustion to rest relief for EIF. Primary outcomes showed as rating of perceived exertion (RPE) with mean difference (MD)=-0.49, 95% confidence interval (CI) [-0.80, -0.19], 800-m race performance with MD=-2.21, 95% CI [-3.57, -0.85], and Harvard Step Index (HSI) with MD=14.75, 95% CI [8.35, 21.15]. Moreover, all primary outcomes as RPE, 800-m race performance and HSI were rated low quality. CONCLUSIONS: Single moxibustion might be considered effective for EIF. However, due to small samples of included RCTs, high risk of bias among studies and poor quality of primary outcomes and subjects restricted to Chinese athletes only, these results present limitation, and should be taken with caution for practice. More large-size studies with rigorous design are warranted to further test effectiveness of moxibustion for EIF."
#6623,[Effect of Acupuncture Stimulation of Different Acupoint Groups on Levels of Stress Hormones and Serum Brain-derived Neurotrophic Factor in Depression Rats],"OBJECTIVE: To screen the effective acupoints for anti-depression in depression rats and to explore the mechanisms of acupuncture for relieving depression. METHODS: Fifty rats were randomly divided into normal control, model, ""Yin-tang"" (EX-HN 3)-""Baihui"" (GV 20, 2-acupoints), EX-HN 3-GV 20-""Fengchi"" (GB 20)-""Shenshu"" (BL 23, 4-acupoints) and medication groups, with 10 rats in each group. The depression model was established by unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) for 28 days. For rats of the 2-acupoints and 4-acupoints groups, EX-HN 3 and GV 20, and EX-HN 3, GV 20, GB 20 and BL 23 were punctured with filiform needles respectively before performing mild stress every time. The acupuncture needles were retained for 30 min during each intervention and the treatment was conducted once daily for 28 days. The rats of the medication group were treated by intragastric administration of Fluoxetine (0.18 mg/kg) once a day for 28 days. The rats' anxiety-like behavior (rearing and crossing times) was detected by open-field test. The contents of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) in the pituitary, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) in the hippocampus, the cortisol (CORT) in the adrenal gland, and the brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the serum were examined by ELISA. RESULTS: Compared to the normal control group, the numbers of both rearing and crossing motions in the model group were significantly decreased (P<0.01, P<0.05), while in comparison with the model group, the rearing and crossing numbers of rats in the 2-acupoints and 4-acupoints and medication groups were significantly increased (P<0.01). ELISA showed that after modeling, the content of adrenal CORT was significantly increased (P<0.01), and those of hippocampal 5-HT and serum BDNF were obviously down-regulated in the model group (P<0.01). After the treatment, the adrenal CORT levels in the three intervention groups were notably down-regulated, and hippocampal 5-HT and serum BONE evidently up-regulated in these 3 intervention groups (P<0.05, P<0.01). No marked changes were found in the pituitary ACTH contents of the model and 3 intervention groups (P>0.05), and no significant differences were shown among the three intervention groups in the levels of the aforementioned 6 indexes (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: Acupuncture intervention can effectively improve the unprompted activates of the depression rats, which may be related to its effects in up-regulating hippocampal 5-HT and serum BONE levels, and in down-regulating adrenal CORT content."

#6742,[Study on the correlation between Chinese medicine syndrome types of the Uighur and Han people and levels of blood lipids and fibrinogen in premature coronary heart disease patients],"OBJECTIVE: To study the correlation between the Chinese medicine (CM) syndrome types of the Uighur and Han people and levels of blood lipids and fibrinogen in premature coronary heart disease (PCHD) patients. METHODS: Recruited were 196 Uighur and 189 Han patients with PCHD first confirmed by coronary angiography at the Heart Center of First Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University and Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital Affiliated to Xinjiang Medical University. Another 60 healthy volunteers were recruited as the healthy control group. CM syndromes were typed by physicians or those having higher professional titles at the cardiac internal medicine. The contents of triglyceride (TG) and total cholesterol (TC) were detected using oxidase method. The high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) level was detected using chemical modification enzymic method. The low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level was detected using selective dissolution. The fibrinogen (FIB) level was detected using Clauss congeal principle. RESULTS: The CM syndrome types of Uighurs were sequenced as filthy turbidity and phlegm obstruction syndrome (82 cases, 21.3%) > qi deficiency and blood stasis syndrome (61 cases, 15.84%) >cold accumulation in Xin meridian syndrome (39 cases, 10.13%) >Xin-Shen yin deficiency syndrome (14 cases, 3. 63%). The CM syndrome types of the Han nationality were sequenced as qi deficiency and blood stasis syndrome (69 cases, 17.92%) >filthy turbidity and phlegm obstruction syndrome (67 cases, 17.40%) > cold accumulation in Xin meridian syndrome (42 cases, 10.91%) > Xin-Shen yin deficiency syndrome (11 cases, 2.86%). There was no statistical difference in the syndrome type distribution between the two groups (P >0.05). Compared with the healthy control group, the levels of TG, LDL-C, and FIB increased, and the HDL-C level decreased in patients of filthy turbidity and phlegm obstruction syndrome and qi deficiency and blood stasis syndrome of the patient group. The HDL-C level decreased in the Uighur patients of Xin-Shen yin deficiency syndrome, showing statistical difference (P < 0.01, P < 0.05). Compared with the Han people of the same syndrome type, the TG level increased and the HDL-C level decreased in the Uighur patients of filthy turbidity and phlegm obstruction syndrome. The FIB level increased in the Uighur patients of qi deficiency and blood stasis syndrome with statistical difference (P<0.05). In the Uighur patients, filthy turbidity and phlegm obstruction syndrome was positively correlated with TG (r=0.469) and FIB (r=0.464), and negatively correlated with HDL-C (r=-0.382). Qi deficiency and blood stasis syndrome was positively correlated with FIB (r=0.72) with statistical difference (P<0.01, P<0.05). In the Han patients, filthy turbidity and phlegm obstruction syndrome was positively correlated with TG (r=0.445) and FIB (r=0.372), and negatively correlated with HDL-C (r=-0.37). Qi deficiency and blood stasis syndrome was positively correlated with TG (r=0.471) and FIB (r=0.459) with statistical difference (P<0.01, P<0.05). CONCLUSION: CM syndrome types were correlated with TG, HDL-C, and FIB in PCHD Han and Uighur patients."
#6746,Effects of acupoint catgut embedding on the postmenopausal osteoporosis patients and related mechanism,"OBJECTIVE: To study the effect and mechanism of acupoint catgut embedding on patients of postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMOP). METHODS: In this prospective study, 90 patients with PMOP who received treatment in our hospital were randomly divided into the drug treatment group (n=45) and drug treatment + catgut embedding group (n=45) according to SPSS random table method. The drug treatment group was given conventional western medicine treatment, and the drug treatment + catgut embedding group was given point embedding therapy. Bone mineral density (BMD), calcium (Ca(2+)), osteoprotegerin (OPG), estrogen (E(2)), receptor activator of nuclear factor-kB ligand (RANKL), liver and kidney function and blood lipids were detected before treatment in the two groups, and visual analogue score (VAS) and PMOP symptom score were evaluated. The above-mentioned indexes were detected again 3 months and 6 months after treatment. RESULTS: At 3 and 6 months after treatment, the BMD and the levels of Ca(2+) and E(2) in the two groups were increased, while the levels of OPG and RANKL were decreased, and the improvement in the drug treatment + catgut embedding group was significantly better than that in the drug treatment group (P<0.05). The symptom scores of VAS and PMOP in the drug treatment + catgut embedding group were significantly lower than those in the drug treatment group (all P<0.001). There was no significant difference in the levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), total bilirubin (TBil), albumin (ALB), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine (SCr) and serum uric acid (SUA) between the two groups, but the levels of total cholesterol (TC) and triglyceride (TG) in the drug treatment + catgut embedding group were significantly lower than those in the drug treatment group (all P<0.001). CONCLUSION: Acupoint catgut embedding has a good effect on PMOP, and it can increase BMO and improve the clinical symptoms of patients, which is worthy of clinical promotion."
#6790,Randomized controlled trial of electro-acupuncture for autism spectrum disorder,"OBJECTIVE: To study the efficacy, safety, and compliance of short-term electro-acupuncture for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled, clinical trial. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Children with ASD were randomly assigned to an electro-acupuncture (EA) group (n=30) or a sham electro-acupuncture (SEA) group (n=25) matched by age and severity of autism. The EA group received electro-acupuncture for selected acupoints while the SEA group received sham electro-acupuncture to sham acupoints. A total of 12 EA and SEA sessions over four weeks were given. Primary outcome measures included Functional Independence Measure for Children (WeeFIM), Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory (PEDI), Leiter International Performance Scale-Revised (Leiter-R), and Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) scale. Secondary outcome measures consisted of Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC), Ritvo-Freeman Real Life Scale (RFRLS), Reynell Developmental Language Scale (RDLS), and a standardized parental report. Data were analyzed by the Mann-Whitney test. RESULTS: There were significant improvements in the language comprehension domain of WeeFIM (p=0.02), self-care caregiver assistant domain of PEDI (p=0.028), and CGI-I (p=0.003) in the EA group compared to the SEA group. As for the parental report, the EA group also showed significantly better social initiation (p=0.01), receptive language (p=0.006), motor skills (p=0.034), coordination (p=0.07), and attention span (p=0.003). More than 70 percent of children with ASD adapted to acupuncture easily, while eight percent had poor acupuncture compliance. Mild side effects of minor superficial bleeding or irritability during acupuncture were observed. CONCLUSION: A short, four-week (12 sessions) course of electro-acupuncture is useful to improve specific functions in children with ASD, especially for language comprehension and self-care ability."
#6801,Prevalence and associated factors of musculoskeletal pain among the dental personnel in a dental school,"OBJECTIVE: To study the prevalence and associated factors of musculoskeletal (MS) pain among the dental personnel. In addition, impacts and treatment of MS pain were reported. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Random sampling of 390 participants from the name lists of dental personnel working in each department. Self-administered questionnaires were equally distributed to three groups of dental personnel namely clinical instructors, postgraduate students, and dental assistants. The present study was conducted as a survey in the Faculty of Dentistry, Mahidol University, Bangkok between December 2008 and January 2009. RESULTS: Three hundred and ninety questionnaires were delivered and 164 questionnaires were returned (response rate 42.5%). The participants with MS pain were 32 clinical instructors (20.3%), 52 postgraduate students (32.9%), and 74 dental assistants (46.8%). Their mean age was 33.0 +/- 9.1 years old. The MS pain found respectively was shoulder pain 72.2% (n = 114), neckpain 70.3% (n = 111), and low backpain 50.6% (n = 80). The participants with shoulder and neckpain were combined and defined as cervicobrachial pain. The associated factor of cervicobrachial pain was working status. Being a clinical instructor and postgraduate student were associated with cervicobrachial pain with OR being 4.7 [1.3, 7.1] and 4.6 [1.6, 13.4], respectively. The impacts of MS pain among the dental personnel included usage of pain relieving medication (34.8%), seeking medical evaluation (32.3%), reduction in working hours (27.2%), difficulty sleeping (22.8%), and work absence (10.8%), respectively. The treatments of MS pain utilized to alleviate those impacts were Thai traditional massage (51.9%), medication (28.5%), physical therapy (15.8%), acupuncture (7.6%), and alternative medicine (4.4%), respectively. CONCLUSION: Cervicobrachial pain was the most prevalent MS pain among the dental personnel and working status was associated with their MS pain problems. The impact of MS pain was predominantly usage of pain relieving medication. Thai traditional massage was the most utilized treatment."
#6804,[Clinical research on relationship between angiogensis and TCM syndrome type of cyclomastopathy],"OBJECTIVE: To study the relationship between angiogensis and TCM Syndrome type of cyclomastopathy (CMP) to investigate the objective standardization of TCM Syndrome diagnosis of the disease. METHODS: One hundred and forty patients with CMP were divided into three groups according to TCM syndrome typing. The pathological type, grade and expressions of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and microvascular density (MVD) in mammary biopsy were observed. RESULTS: The expressions of VEGF, bFGF and MVD was different in CMP patients of different TCM types and pathological grades (P < 0.05). The proportion of atypical proliferation, the count of MVD and the expression of VEGF and bFGF were higher in patients of phlegm and stasis type than those in Gan stagnation caused Qistagnation type and Chong and Ren meridians disorder type. CONCLUSION: TCM Syndrome type of CMP patients is related with vascular activity and grade of angiogensis. The pathological characteristics of mammary tissue and expression of VEGF, bFGF and MVD can be regarded as the objective indexes of TCM typing and clinical efficacy evaluation for CMP."
#6810,Comparative study on treatment of acute gouty arthritis by electroacupuncture with different frequency,"OBJECTIVE: To study the therapeutic effect of treatment of acute gouty arthritis (AGA) respectively by electroacupuncture (EA) with different frequency and oral intake of Western medicine. METHODS: Seventy-two patients of AGA were randomly assigned into three groups, 24 in each group. Group A was treated with EA 100 Hz; Group B with EA 2 Hz; and Group C with Western medicine. The analgesic effect, initiating time and sustaining time of analgesia were observed and the level of serum uric acid was measured before and after treatment. RESULTS: The initiating time of analgesia was shorter while the sustaining time of analgesia was longer in Group A and B than those in Group C (all P < 0.01). The efficacy of analgesia was higher in Group B than that in Group A, and a better effect was shown in Group B in reducing serum uric acid level than that in Group A (P < 0.01), which was near that in Group C (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: EA is an effective treatment for AGA, and low frequency (2 Hz) EA showed a better efficacy."
#6815,[Effect of electroacupuncture on NMDAR-2 B mRNA expression in hippocampal tissue in vascular dementia rats],"OBJECTIVE: To study the underlying mechanism of electroacupuncture (EA) in improving learning-memory ability in vascular dementia (VD) rats. METHODS: SD rats were randomized into control, sham operation (sham), VD model, non-acupoint and acupoint groups, with 10 cases in each. VD model was established by occlusion of the bilateral common carotid arteries. Morris water maze test was performed to detect the rats' learning-memory ability. The expression of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-2 B mRNA in hippocampal CA 1 region and dentate gyrus was measured by hybridization in situ. EA (2 Hz, 1-2 mA)was applied to ""Baihui"" (GV 20), ""Dazhui"" (GV 14) and bilateral ""Shenshu""(BL 23) and non-acupoint (the chest-abdominal juncture between the first and the second lumbar vertebrae) for 20 min, once daily for 30 days. RESULTS: Self-comparison showed that 6 weeks after modeling, the escape latencies of control and sham groups, and the lingering duration in the 3rd quadrant of water pool of model, non-acupoint and acupoint groups decreased significantly (P < 0.05), while the escape latencies of model, non-acupoint and acupoint groups, and the lingering duration of control and sham groups increased considerably (P < 0.5). No significant differences were found between control and sham groups, and among model, non-acupoint and acupoint groups in the escape latency and the lingering duration in the 3rd quadrant (P > 0.05). On the 11th week after modeling, compared to their individual escape latencies and lingering duration on the 6th week, the escape latencies of controll sham and acupoint groups shortened obviously (P < 0.05), while the lingering duration in the 3""rd quadrant of the same 3 groups postponed significantly (P < 0.05). Compared with model group, the escape latency of acupoint group shortened obviously and the lingering duration increased significantly (P < 0.05). No significant differences were found between control and sham groups, and between model and non-acupoint groups in these two indexes (P > 0.05). Compared to control/sham group, the grey values of NMDAR-2 BmRNA expression in hippocampal CA 1 region and dentate gyrus in model and non-acupoint groups decreased significantly (P < 0.05). Compared to model group, the grey values of NMDAR-2 B mRNA expression in these two brain regions increased markedly (P < 0.05). No significant difference was found between control and sham groups, and between model and non-acupoint groups (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Acupoint-EA is able to improve VD rats' learning-memory ability which may be related to its effect in upregulating the expression of NMDAR-2 B mRNA in hippocampal and dentate gyrus."
#6868,Efficacy and safety of acupuncture therapy for neuropsychiatric symptoms among patients with Parkinson's disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"OBJECTIVE: To systematically evaluate the efficacy and safety of acupuncture therapy for neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with Parkinson's disease. METHODS: We searched eight databases from their inception until 14 April 2024, including PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, Web of Science, SinoMed, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, China Science and Technology Periodical Database, and Wanfang Database. The search aimed to find randomized controlled trials assessing the effectiveness of acupuncture for neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with Parkinson's disease. Literature screening and data extraction were performed independently by the authors. Meta-analysis was conducted using RevMan V.5.3 software, and Stata 17.0 software was used for detecting publication bias and performing sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: Twenty-eight studies, involving 2148 participants, met the inclusion criteria. The meta-analysis revealed that acupuncture therapy improved depression-related scale scores (standardized mean difference (SMD) = -0.70, 95%CI [-0.98, -0.42], p < 0.00001), anxiety-related scale scores (SMD = -0.78, 95% CI [-1.43, -0.14], p = 0.02), Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores (weighted mean difference (WMD) = 2.74, 95% CI [2.43, 3.05], p < 0.00001), Mini Mental State Examination scores (WMD = 2.36, 95% CI [0.78, 3.94], p = 0.003), Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale scores, and Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39 scores (WMD = -2.66, 95% CI [-4.83, -0.49], p = 0.02) compared to controls. CONCLUSION: This review supports the application of acupuncture to reduce the severity of neuropsychiatric symptoms including depression, anxiety, and impulse control disorders, and to improve cognition and quality of life in patients with Parkinson's disease. The adverse effects associated with acupuncture, either alone or as adjunctive therapy, were relatively minor."
#6909,[Observation on the therapeutic effect of acupoint application on constipation],"OBJECTIVE: To test the therapeutic effect, safety of acupoint application for treatment of constipation. METHODS: Forty-two cases were randomly divided into a treatment group of 22 cases and a control group of 20 cases. The treatment group were treated with acupoint application, with the cake made by Sanleng (Rhizoma Spargani), Ezhu (Rhizoma Zedoariae), Dahuang (Radix et Rhizoma Rhei) and Bingpian (Borneolum), which was applied at Tianshu (ST 25), Qihai (CV 6), Guanyuan (CV 4); the control group were treated with oral administration of Congrong Tongbian Oral Liquid. RESULTS: The total effective rate was 81.8% in the treatment group and 50.0% in the control group, the treatment group being better than the control group (P < 0.05); the first defecation time was (5.1 +/- 2.8) h in the treatment group and (10.1 +/- 7.3) h in the control group, with a significant difference between the two groups (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: TCM acupoint application therapy has a definite therapeutic effect on constipation."
#6911,[Incidence rate and acupuncture-moxibustion treatment of post-stroke depression],"OBJECTIVE: To understand the incidence of post-stroke depression (PSD) and the therapeutic effect of acupuncture-moxibustion. METHODS: Five hundred and sixty cases were rating with Hamilton depression scale, and lesion parts, gender, age and property of stroke between the PSD and non-PSD were compared by analysis of variance, chi2 test, and then the patients of PSD were randomly divided into two groups and treated respectively with Prozac-20 and acup-moxibustion at Sishencong (EX-HN 1), Anmian, Neiguan (PC 6), Shenmen (HT 7), Zusanli (ST 36), Sanyinjiao (SP 6), Taichong (LR 3), Zhaohai (KI 6), Shenmai (BL 62). RESULTS: The total incidence rate of PSD was 43.9%, with no relation to the lesion parts, gender, age and property of stroke (P > 0.05), and there were very significant differences in HAMD scores before and after treatment in the two groups (P < 0.0001), with no significant difference in the effective rate between the two groups (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: PSD has a high incidence and influences the recovery of nervous function, and it should be treated at early stage. Acup-moxibustion and Prozac-20 have similar therapeutic effect."
#7005,Preoperative electroacupuncture for postoperative nausea and vomiting in laparoscopic gynecological surgery: a randomized controlled trial,"OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of preoperative electroacupuncture (EA) on the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), and severity of postoperative pain, in gynecological patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery. The effects of EA administered at different preoperative time points were compared. METHODS: A total of 413 patients undergoing elective laparoscopic gynecological surgery were randomly allocated into 4 groups receiving EA the day before surgery (Group Pre, n = 103), 30 min before (Group 30, n = 104) or both (Group Comb, n = 103), or usual care alone (Group Usual, n = 103). All acupuncture groups had usual care. The incidence of PONV and pain at 24 h were primary outcomes. Secondary outcomes included the severity of postoperative nausea, vomiting and pain, requirement for antiemetic medication and quality of recovery (QoR)-15 scores after surgery. RESULTS: There were significant differences between the four groups in nausea and vomiting incidence (0-24 h), postoperative antiemetic use (0-48 h), and postoperative pain (0-6 h), with the EA groups recording the lowest levels. Regarding primary outcomes, incidence of nausea and vomiting at 6-24 h was 28/11/18/11% (p = 0.003) 23/5/8/9% (p < 0.001), respectively, for Groups Usual/Pre/30/Comb. Accordingly, EA reduced the incidence of nausea and vomiting at 6-24 h by 61/34/60% and 79/65/61% for Groups Pre/30/Comb, respectively. Regarding secondary outcomes, incidence of nausea and vomiting at 0-6 h was 20/9/11/7% (p = 0.013) and 17/7/9/6% (p = 0.021), respectively, for Groups Usual/Pre/30/Comb. Rescue antiemetics at 0-6 h were required by 18/4/11/4% (p = 0.001) in Groups Usual/Pre/30/Comb. The mean numerical rating scale (NRS) pain score (0-10) at 0-6 h was significantly different between groups (2.45/1.89/2.01/1.97 for Groups Usual/Pre/30/Comb, p = 0.024). There were no significant differences between the three EA-treated groups. CONCLUSION: In gynecological patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery and treated with multimodal antiemetic methods, one session of preoperative EA may be a safe adjunctive treatment for PONV prophylaxis. Optimal timing of EA requires further verification. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ChiCTR-INR-16010035 (Chinese Clinical Trial Registry)."
#7067,"Intraoperative acupuncture for posttonsillectomy pain: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial","OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: To evaluate the effect of intraoperative acupuncture on posttonsillectomy pain in the pediatric population. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. METHODS: Patients aged 3 to 12 years undergoing tonsillectomy were recruited at a tertiary children's hospital between February 2011 and May 2012. Participants were block-randomized to receive acupuncture or sham acupuncture during anesthesia for tonsillectomy. Surgeons, staff, and parents were blinded from treatment. Tonsillectomy was performed by one of two surgeons using a standard technique (monopolar cautery), and a single anesthetic protocol was followed. Study endpoints included time spent in the postanesthesia care unit, the amount of opioids administered in the perioperative period, and pain measures and presence of nausea/vomiting from postoperative home surveys. RESULTS: Fifty-nine children aged 3 to 12 years were randomized to receive acupuncture (n = 30) or sham acupuncture (n = 29). No significant demographic differences were noted between the two cohorts. Perioperative data were recorded for all patients; 73% of patients later returned home surveys. There were no significant differences in the amount of opioid medications administered or total postanesthesia care unit time between the two cohorts. Home surveys of patients but not of parents revealed significant improvements in pain control in the acupuncture treatment-group postoperatively (P = 0.0065 and 0.051, respectively), and oral intake improved significantly earlier in the acupuncture treatment group (P = 0.01). No adverse effects of acupuncture were reported. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that intraoperative acupuncture is feasible, well tolerated, and results in improved pain and earlier return of diet postoperatively. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 1b."
#7082,AHRQ Comparative Effectiveness Reviews,"OBJECTIVES: A review was undertaken to evaluate the peer-reviewed literature on three areas of tinnitus management for the following Key Questions (KQs): (1) measures used to assess patients for management needs (KQ1); (2) effectiveness of treatments (KQ2); and (3) identification of prognostic factors (KQ3). DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE(®), Embase(®), CINAHL(®), PsycINFO(®), AMED(©), and Cochrane CENTRAL were searched from January 1970 to June 2012. An extensive grey literature search, which included documents from regulatory and tinnitus-related organizations, was also undertaken. REVIEW METHODS: Standardized systematic review methodology was employed. Eligibility criteria included English-language studies of adults with subjective idiopathic (nonpulsatile) tinnitus; excluded studies involved tinnitus as the result of middle-ear pathologies or focused on methods to determine psychosomatic tinnitus. For KQ2, all pharmacological/food supplement, medical/surgical, sound/technological, and psychological/behavioral interventions aimed at ameliorating tinnitus symptoms were eligible (except stapedectomy or tympanoplasty). Randomized controlled trials with placebo controls or head-to-head trials were eligible for all KQs. RESULTS: From 9,725 citations, 52 eligible publications were extracted for data. None were eligible for KQ1 or KQ3. From the 52 publications eligible for KQ2, 17 evaluated pharmacological interventions; 11 evaluated medical interventions (low-level laser, acupuncture, transcranial magnetic stimulation); 5 evaluated sound technologies; and 19 evaluated psycholocal/behavioral interventions. Data on adverse effects were generally poorly collected and reported. CONCLUSIONS: There is low strength of evidence (SOE) indicating that cognitive behavioral therapy interventions improve tinnitus-specific quality of life relative to inactive controls. For pharmacological interventions, SOE is low for improvements to subjective loudness from neurotransmitter drugs versus placebo; insufficient for antidepressants, other drugs, and food supplements with respect to subjective loudness; and insufficient for all other outcomes. There is insufficient SOE to suggest that medical interventions improve outcomes relative to inactive controls; sleep and global quality of life were not evaluated for medical interventions. The SOE for the adverse effect of sedation in pharmacological studies was judged insufficient. Future research should address the substantial gaps identified for KQ1 and KQ3. For KQ2, future research should concentrate on improving collection of adverse effects, calculating sample size, and specifying doses for interventions."
#7090,Can perioperative acupuncture reduce the pain and vomiting experienced after tonsillectomy? A meta-analysis,"OBJECTIVES: Acupuncture has been shown to reduce pain, nausea, and vomiting. However, its use alongside surgical interventions remains a novel practice, despite the increasing applications of alternative medicine. The goal of this meta-analysis was to perform a systematic review of the literature addressing the effect of acupuncture on postoperative pain, nausea, and vomiting following tonsillectomy. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, SCOPUS, and Cochrane database. METHODS: Two authors independently searched the databases from the inception of article collection until June 2015. We included 1) analysis studies that compared groups of patients who had received perioperative acupuncture (acupuncture groups) with those who had received a pain control agent or sham treatment (control group); and 2) analysis studies in which the outcomes of interest were postoperative pain intensity, rescue analgesic consumption, or nausea and vomiting. RESULTS: The pain score reported by patients during the first 48 hours and the postoperative need for analgesics were significantly lower in the acupuncture group versus the control group. Additionally, the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting was significantly lower in the acupuncture group than in the control group. No major adverse effects of perioperative acupuncture were reported in the enrolled studies. CONCLUSION: Perioperative acupuncture may provide pain relief without side effects in patients undergoing tonsillectomy. However, there were high levels of heterogeneity in several of the measured parameters; thus, the efficacy of acupuncture cannot be considered to have been evaluated sufficiently. For this reason, additional large well-designed trials are required to further support the results of this study. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: NA. Laryngoscope, 126:608-615, 2016."
#7127,Intravenous Single Dose Toxicity of Sweet Bee Venom in Sprague-Dawley Rats,"OBJECTIVES: Anaphylactic shock can be fatal to people who become hypersensitive when bee venom pharmacopuncture (BVP) is used. Thus, sweet bee venom (SBV) was developed to reduce these allergic responses. SBV is almost pure melittin, and SBV has been reported to have fewer allergic responses than BVP. BVP has been administered only into acupoints or intramuscularly, but we thought that intravenous injection might be possible if SBV were shown to be a safe medium. The aim of this study is to evaluate the intravenous injection toxicity of SBV through a single-dose test in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. METHODS: Male and female 6-week-old SD rats were injected intravenously with SBV (high dosage: 1.0 mL/animal; medium dosage: 0.5 mL/animal; low dosage: 0.1 mL/animal). Normal saline was injected into the control group in a similar method. We conducted clinical observations, body weight measurements, and hematology, biochemistry, and histological observations. RESULTS: No death was observed in any of the experimental groups. Hyperemia was observed in the high and the medium dosage groups on the injection day, but from next day, no general symptoms were observed in any of the experimental groups. No significant changes due to intravenous SBV injection were observed in the weights, in the hematology, biochemistry, and histological observations, and in the local tolerance tests. CONCLUSION: The results of this study confirm that the lethal dose of SBV is over 1.0 mL/animal in SD rats and that the intravenous injection of SBV is safe in SD rats."
#7281,Complementary and alternative interventions for stroke recovery - a narrative overview of the published evidence,"OBJECTIVES: Stroke survivors dissatisfied with their progress often seek complementary and alternative interventions (CAI). This paper reviews the evidence for CAIs in stroke recovery. METHODS: A literature search was performed for publications until December 2019 of CAI for stroke in Pubmed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED. Evidence was assessed according to Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine criteria. RESULTS: In a meta-analysis, acupuncture reduced death or dependency compared to control at the end of follow-up and over the long term (≥3 months), OR 0.61(95%CI 0.46-0.79) and OR 0.67(95%CI 0.53-0.85) respectively, but was neutral against sham acupuncture. A Cochrane review of acupuncture vs. sham acupuncture in subacute or chronic stroke vs. showed no differences in motor function and quality of life. Three trials found favourable effects of moxibustion on motor function (SMD=0.72, 95%CI 0.37-1.08, p<0.0001). Two trials showed cupping compared to acupuncture reduced hemiplegic shoulder pain and upper-limb 'myodynamia'. A meta-analysis of traditional Chinese medicines for ischaemic stroke showed marked improvement in neurological deficit on stroke scales. There was no evidence for Ayurveda, homoeopathy or reiki. Tui-na reduced the Modified Ashworth Scale in some muscle groups. Marma massage improved Motricity Index and trunk control. Thai massage and herbal treatments improved the Barthel Index. On meta-analysis, Yoga improved memory and anxiety, while tai-chi improved activities of daily living, balance and walking ability. Studies were generally of poor quality. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence for benefit of CAIs for stroke recovery is weak. More research is needed to justify these treatments for stroke, by well-conducted, adequately-sized, double-blinded, randomized controlled trials."
#7284,Interventions for dry mouth and hyposalivation in Sjögren's syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"OBJECTIVES: Systematic review with meta-analysis of interventions for dry mouth symptoms and hyposalivation of Sjögren's syndrome (SS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Cochrane Central and EMBASE up to February 2018 for randomized trials of interventions for dry mouth and hyposalivation of SS. The primary outcome was the mean change in xerostomia symptoms. The secondary outcomes included changes in salivary flow and quality of life. We used the Cochrane risk of bias tool for individual studies and the GRADE method to summarize the quality of evidence across studies for the included outcomes. RESULTS: Thirty-six studies (3,274 patients) were included in the systematic review. Results from the meta-analyses showed high-quality evidence that pilocarpine was superior to placebo in reducing dry mouth symptoms. We found moderate quality of evidence that pilocarpine, rituximab and interferon-alpha were more effective than placebo in increasing salivary flow, with the relevant effect size being large for pilocarpine, and notably smaller for rituximab and interferon-alpha. CONCLUSION: Clinicians should be very confident in the beneficial effects of pilocarpine upon dry mouth symptoms of SS and moderately confident that pilocarpine, rituximab and interferon-alpha can have beneficial effects upon salivary flow. Adverse events are common. The use of other treatment modalities cannot be supported on the basis of current evidence."
#7377,"The Effects of Sa-am Acupuncture Simpo-jeongkyeok Treatment on the Blood Pressure, Pulse Rate, and Body Temperature","OBJECTIVES: The present study evaluated the effects of sa-am acupuncture (SAA) simpo-jeongkyeok (SPJK) treatment on the blood pressure (BP), pulse rate (PR), and body temperature (BT) of patients with hwa byung (HB). METHODS: This patient assessor blind, randomized, placebo controlled trial included 50 volunteers, divided randomly into two groups. The treatment group underwent SPJK (PC9, LR1, PC3, KI10) while the control (sham) group received minimal needle insertion at non acupoints. The BP in both arms, PR, and BT at several acupoints were measured before and after treatment at the 1(st), 2(nd), 3(rd), and 4(th) visits and before treatment at the follow-up visit. We analyzed data by using the repeated measured analysis of variance (RM ANOVA), Mann-Whitney U, and wilcoxon signed rank tests; differences at P < 0.05 were considered significant. RESULTS: No significant differences in the systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and PR between the treatment and control group were observed at each visit. However, the decrease in the SBP for the treatment group before and after each visit was significantly higher than it was in the control group. The SBP in both arms in the treatment group was decreased between visits 1 and 2, 1 and 3, 1 and 4, and 1 and follow-up. The DBP in both arms and in the right arm between visits 1 and 3 in the treatment group showed decreases. A minimal BT increase for treatment at CV06 and CV12 and a minimal BT decrease for treatment at CV17 and (Ex) Yintang were found. Patients in the treatment group who visited more frequently experienced a greater decrease in the PR, but that effect was not maintained. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that SAA SPJK treatment has instant positive effects on the BP, PR, and BT in patients with HB, but the effects on the BP and PR are not maintained."

DESIGN AND SUBJECTS: Women with mediolateral episiotomy during delivery were enrolled in this study and were assigned to be treated or not with acupuncture. OUTCOMES MEASURES: Perineal pain relieving effect of acupuncture was evaluated considering oral analgesics request during post-partum period and was the main outcome of this trial. RESULTS: A total of 42 women were enrolled in this trial. Twenty-one (21) women were treated with ""wrist-ankle"" acupuncture, inserting one needle in their right ankle. A second group of 21 women was not treated with acupuncture. Women in the acupuncture group were significantly less likely to experience pain; only 8 of them (38.1%) asked for analgesics. All women in the second group assumed oral analgesics because of perineal pain (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Wrist-ankle acupuncture during the postpartum period is effective for perineal pain relief after mediolateral episiotomy."
#7391,"The effects of triple therapy (acupuncture, diet and exercise) on body weight: a randomized, clinical trial","OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of diet and exercise vs acupuncture, diet and exercise on the body weight and related parameters of adult women. METHODS: Twenty-seven obese women with a body fat percentage of more than 30% were randomized into three groups. The first experimental group had diet and exercise, whereas the second experimental group had diet, exercise and acupuncture. The control group received no intervention at all. The study period lasted for 8 weeks. Body weight, skin fold thickness, body mass index and fat mass were measured before and after 8 weeks. RESULTS: Body mass index and fat mass, decreased significantly (P<0.05) in both experimental groups when compared with the control group. However, there was no significant difference between the two experimental groups. Changes in lean body mass after 8 weeks were not significantly different from those in the control group. CONCLUSION: It is concluded that acupuncture combined with diet and exercise does not generate larger reductions in body weight, fat mass or body mass index than diet and exercise alone."
#7426,Acupuncture for migraine: A systematic review and meta-regression of randomized controlled trials,"OBJECTIVES: This meta-analysis aimed to explore the relationship between the dose of acupuncture sessions, acupuncture frequency, and acupuncture duration and its effects on migraine. METHODS: Eight databases were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the efficacy of penetrating manual acupuncture for migraine published in English and Chinese from inception to June 20, 2024. The robust-error meta-regression (REMR) approach and non-linear meta-regression with restricted cubic spline (RCS) were used to investigate the dose-response association between acupuncture sessions, acupuncture frequency, and acupuncture duration and the frequency of migraine attacks. The potential nonlinear relationships was tested by restricting the regression coefficient to zero and a P value＜0.1. The statistical analysis was conducted using Stata 17.0. The risk of bias was independently assessed by two reviewers using the Cochrane tool. The reporting quality for acupuncture procedures was evaluated by STRICTA criteria. RESULTS: Thirty-two RCTs involving 1562 participants were included, and the results showed a J-shaped dose-response association between acupuncture sessions, acupuncture frequency, and acupuncture duration and migraine attack frequency. After 16 acupuncture sessions, the change in the frequency of migraine attacks was 3.95 (95 %CI: 3.13 to 4.77). Three sessions of acupuncture a week resulted in a significant decrease in the frequency of migraine attacks, reaching 4.04 (95 % CI: 2.49 to 5.58). After two months of acupuncture, the frequency of migraine attacks decreased significantly, showing a difference of 4.05 (95 % CI: 3.61 to 4.49). Subsequently, the improvement trend gradually flattened, yielding diminishing benefits to patients. The risk of bias showed that seven studies were rated as ""low risk"", two were rated as ""high risk"", and the others were rated as ""unclear risk"". The reporting quality of RCTs of acupuncture for migraine remain suboptimal. CONCLUSIONS: A non-linear dose-response relationship was found between acupuncture sessions, acupuncture frequency, and acupuncture duration and migraine attack frequency. The results of our study recommend 16 sessions of acupuncture with a frequency of 3 sessions/week and a treatment duration of 1.5 to 2 months. REGISTRATION NUMBER: This meta-analysis has been registered on PROSPERO (CRD42023400493)."
#7448,Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Efficacy and Safety of Fire Needling and Warm Needling on Acute Gout,"OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of heat stimuli (e.g., fire needling, warm needling) in acupuncture for acute gout. METHODS: Four international online databases (PubMed, Cochrane, Embase, and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure) were searched to identify randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) that used fire needling and warm needling for acute gout. The methodological quality of the RCTs was evaluated using the Cochrane risk-of-bias (RoB) tool. Thirteen RCTs (840 patients) were included and analyzed. Three evaluation tools (total effective rate, uric acid level, and pain score) were mainly used. Comparisons were made between Western medicine (WM) and i) fire needling or warm needling treatment alone, ii) fire needling and bloodletting combination treatment, iii) combination of fire needling, bloodletting, and herbal medicine, iv) warm needling (concurrently). Heat stimuli in acupuncture alone or in combination treatment were more effective in terms of the total efficacy rates, uric acid levels, and pain scores than WM alone. RESULTS: In all the evaluation tools, the treatment effects in the fire needling alone or warm needling alone treatment group and the fire needling and bloodletting combination intervention group were significantly better than those in the WM control group. The warm needling and WM combination intervention groups also experienced significantly better treatment effects in terms of total efficacy rates and uric acid levels. Only the pain scores in the fire needling, bloodletting, and herbal medicine combination groups demonstrated significant improvement. Only four studies mentioned adverse reactions one reported loss of appetite; three studies reported none. According to the Cochrane RoB tool, most studies showed either high or uncertain RoB. CONCLUSION: Heat stimuli during acupuncture could be effective for acute gout. However, as the included studies were regionally biased, more high-quality studies are needed to confirm the level of evidence."
#7478,Effect of intensive acupuncture on pain-related social and psychological variables for women with chronic neck and shoulder pain--an RCT with six month and three year follow up,"OBJECTIVES: This study examines whether intensive acupuncture treatment can improve several social and psychological variables for women with chronic pain in the neck and shoulders, and whether possible effects are long-lasting. The effects on pain have been reported elsewhere. METHODS: Twenty-four female office workers (47 +/- 9 years old, mean +/- SD) who had had neck and shoulder pain for 12 +/- 9 years, were randomly assigned to a test group or a control group. Acupuncture was applied 10 times during three to four weeks either at presumed acupuncture points for pain (test group) or at sham points (control group). In addition, acupressure was given to patients between treatments, at either real or sham points. Questionnaires for social and psychological variables were completed before each treatment, just after the course, and six months and three years later. RESULTS: The pain-related activity impairment at work was significantly less in the test group than the controls by the end of treatment (P < 0.04). Also there were significant differences between the groups for quality of sleep, anxiety, depression and satisfaction with life (P < 0.05). At six months and three years follow ups the acupuncture group showed further improvements in most variables and was again significantly different from the control group. CONCLUSION: Intensive acupuncture treatment may improve activity at work and several relevant social and psychological variables for women with chronic pain in the neck and shoulders. The effect may last for at least three years."
#7633,Efficacy and dispensing patterns of TCM-acupuncture combinations in vascular dementia treatment: a meta-analysis and data mining analysis,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the clinical efficacy of the combination of acupuncture and medicine for vascular dementia (VD) treatment, and to analyze and summarize the relevant association rules. METHODS: A systematic search of Chinese and English databases such as CNKI, VIP, Wanfang, Embase, PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science was performed along with a manual search to screen for randomized controlled trials that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria that were published over a period from January 1, 2000, to July 31, 2023. Literature quality assessment and meta-analysis were performed using the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and RevMan 5.4 to explore the efficacy of TCM-acupuncture combination therapy and conventional Western medical therapy for VD treatment, as well as assess relevant improvements in MMSE, ADL, and HDS scale scores. A study database was created by entering the required data into MS Excel. The PROSPERO registration number for this systematic evaluation is CRD42023458282. High-use-frequency drugs and acupoints were screened for by using frequency statistics, and the nature of their categories was recorded separately. The source database was then imported into SPSS (version 26.0.0.2) and IBM SPSS Modeler (version 18.0) to elucidate high-use-frequency TCM drugs and acupoints for VD treatment. RESULTS: Eighteen randomized controlled clinical trials with a total of 1617 participants were finally included. The meta-analysis results suggested that treatment combining traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) with acupuncture performed better in terms of efficacy and clinical improvement of related outcome indicators [OR = 2.54, 95% CI (1.98, 3.26), P < 0.05]. Twenty-four prescription drug groups and 18 acupuncture prescriptions were extracted from the 18 included studies. The following results were obtained: (1) The drugs with the highest use frequency were Acori Tatarinowii Rhizoma, Glycyrrhizae Radix Et Rhizoma, and Salviae Miltiorrhizae Radix Et Rhizoma; high-use-frequency tonifying herbs; and sweet, warm, and liver meridian-attributing drugs. (2) The acupoints with the highest use frequency were Baihui, Sishencong, and Zusanli, often applied on the head, face, and Du meridian points, as well as on high-use-frequency crossing acupoints. (3) The high-use-frequency drugs and acupoints could be clustered into four categories each. (4) The strongest associations were noted for the drug pairs Polygalae Radix-Glycyrrhizae Radix Et Rhizoma and Polugoni Multiflori Radix-Acori Tatarinowii Rhizoma, as well as the acupoint pairs Sishencong-Baihui and Zusanli-Baihui. CONCLUSION: TCM drugs combined with acupuncture demonstrated considerable clinical efficacy for VD treatment. The TCM-based treatment of VD mostly starts from the liver meridian and the Du meridian, with the use of more sweet and warm herbs and crossing acupoints. The general principles of treatment include smoothening the flow of qi and blood, tonifying the liver and kidneys in TCM, and enhancing the patient's mood and cognitive function."
#7634,Combined anesthesia of acupuncture-pharmacotherapy in pulmonary resection surgery: systematic review and Meta-analysis,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the clinical value and safety of combined anesthesia of acupuncture-pharmacotherapy in pulmonary resection surgery. METHODS: The randomized controlled trials (RCTs) related to combined anesthesia of acupuncture-pharmacotherapy in pulmonary resection surgery were searched in PubMed, EMbase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, SinoMed, CNKI, VIP database, Wanfang database, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (http://www.chictr.org.cn/) from the inception of each database up to July 12, 2022. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool, and Meta-analysis was conducted using RevMan5.4. RESULTS: A total of 33 RCTs were included, involving 2 526 participants. The Meta-analysis results showed that compared to conventional anesthesia, the patients receiving combined anesthesia of acupuncture-pharmacotherapy had more stable vital signs during surgery, reduced intraoperative fentanyl usage [SMD=-3.73, 95%CI(-5.28, -2.18), Z=4.72, P<0.000 01], decreased postoperative sufentanil consumption [MD=-20.85, 95%CI(-24.84, -16.86), Z=10.24, P<0.000 01], reduced total/effective presses of the postoperative patient-controlled analgesia pump [MD=-5.70, 95% CI(-9.04, -2.36), Z=3.35, P=0.000 8], lowered postoperative pain visual analogue scale (VAS) [MD=-1.63, 95%CI(-2.02, -1.23), Z=7.97, P<0.000 01], shorter length of postoperative hospital stay [MD=-1.14, 95%CI(-1.85, -0.43), Z=3.15, P=0.002], and higher levels of CD 4+ T lymphocytes, CD 8+ T lymphocytes, natural killer (NK) cell activity, and superoxide dismutase (SOD). Additionally, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), adrenaline and cortisol levels were decreased (P<0.05). No adverse events related to acupuncture or electrical stimulation were reported, and the incidence of postoperative complications was lower than that of conventional anesthesia [RR=0.47, 95%CI(0.36, 0.62), Z=5.36, P<0.000 01]. CONCLUSIONS: The combined anesthesia of acupuncture-pharmacotherapy in pulmonary resection surgery could improve anesthesia and analgesia effectiveness, reduce anesthesia drug usage, regulate immune responses, suppress stress reactions, and the safety is satisfactory. However, there is substantial heterogeneity among the included studies, and outcome measures vary widely. Further large-sample, high-quality, internationally standardized clinical trials are needed to clarify its clinical value and safety, providing reliable evidence for clinical practice."
#7684,Electroacupuncture promotes gastrointestinal function recovery in patients undergoing laparoscopic gastrectomy : a randomized controlled trial,"OBJECTIVES: To explore the clinical effect of electroacupuncture (EA) on promoting gastrointestinal function recovery in patients undergoing laparoscopic gastrectomy. METHODS: One hundred and twenty patients undergoing laparoscopic gastrectomy were randomly divided into an EA group (40 cases, 1 case was eliminated), a placebo EA (PEA) group (40 cases, 1 case dropped out) and a conventional treatment group (40 cases, 1 case dropped out). The patients in the conventional treatment group received perioperative routine treatment. On the basis of routine treatment, patients in the EA group and the PEA group were given electroacupuncture or placebo electroacupuncture stimulation at 24,48 and 72 h after anesthesia recovery. Bilateral Neiguan (PC 6), Zusanli (ST 36) and Shangjuxu (ST 37) were selected, and the electrodes of SDV-Z electroacupuncture instrument were connected to Zusanli (ST 36) and Shangjuxu (ST 37) on the same side respectively. Continuous wave was selected, the frequency was 5 Hz, and the needles were retained for 30 min each time. The postoperative gastrointestinal-2 ( GI-2 ) time, the incidence of grade A/B delayed gastric emptying were compared among the three groups, and the safety of acupuncture was evaluated. RESULTS: The GI-2 time of the EA group was significantly shorter than that of the PEA group and the conventional treatment group (P<0.05). The incidence of grade A and grade B of delayed gastric emptying in the EA group was lower than that in the PEA group and the conventional treatment group (P<0.05). No acupuncture-related adverse reactions occurred. CONCLUSIONS: EA can promote the recovery of gastrointestinal function in patients undergoing laparoscopic gastrectomy, and the treatment plan is safe, which is worthy of promotion and application into the enhanced recovery surgery program."
#7728,Electroacupuncture improves synaptic plasticity by regulating the 5-HT1A receptor in hippocampus of rats with chronic unpredictable mild stress,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the antidepressant effects of electroacupuncture (EA) on chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) in rats, as well as the effects of EA on hippocampal neurons, synaptic morphology, and 5-hydroxytryptamine (HT) receptor expression. METHODS: Forty adult male Wistar rats were randomly divided into normal control, CUMS, EA, and paroxetine groups. CUMS modeling was performed for 21 days, followed by 14 days of intervention: rats in the EA group underwent stimulation of GV20 and GV29 acupuncture points for 30 minutes daily; rats in the paroxetine group were administered paroxetine daily. Behavioral tests, transmission electron microscopy, western blotting, and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction were used to evaluate the effects of the intervention. RESULTS: EA treatment reversed the behavioral changes observed in rats due to CUMS modeling; it also improved the pathological changes in organelles and synaptic structures of hippocampal neurons, and upregulated the protein and mRNA expression levels of 5-HT1A receptor. There were no significant differences in 5-HT1B receptor protein and mRNA expression levels among the groups. CONCLUSIONS: EA treatment can alleviate depression-like symptoms in CUMS rats. The underlying mechanism may include promoting the expression of 5-HT1A receptor mRNA and protein, thereby improving synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus."
#7735,"Acupuncture versus usual care for postoperative nausea and vomiting in children after tonsillectomy/adenoidectomy: a pragmatic, multicentre, double-blinded, randomised trial","OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effect of a standardised acupuncture on nausea and vomiting in children after tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy when possible placebo effects were precluded. METHODS: A pragmatic, multicentre, double-blinded, randomised controlled trial. The study was conducted over 10 months in 2012-2013 at three ambulatory clinics. Two hundred and eighty-two children, age 1-11 years, American Society of Anesthesiologists grade ≤II, were included. To equalise expectancy effects, all parents were told that their child would receive acupuncture. However, children were randomly allocated to perioperative bilateral needling acupuncture at PC6, depth 7 mm, mean time 17 min (SD 5-45) during anaesthesia plus usual care, or to usual care only. The regional ethics committee approved this approach. Primary endpoints were nausea and vomiting 24 h postoperatively. RESULTS: This study did not demonstrate any effect of acupuncture (95% CI) compared with standard care. The overall vomiting in the acupuncture and usual-care groups was 44.2% and 47.9%, respectively. Nausea was experienced by 31.7% in the acupuncture group and by 32.6% in the usual-care group. The test power was acceptable for comparisons of vomiting. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that when controlling for possible placebo effects standardised PC6 acupuncture needling during anaesthesia without further stimulation of PC6 is not effective in reducing nausea and vomiting in children after tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy. Future studies should investigate acupuncture treatment which balances adequate dose and technique and a feasible, child-friendly acupuncture treatment. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01729052."
#7741,Mechanisms of Peitu Yimu acupuncture in repairing intestinal mucosal barrier by regulating CRF/CRFR1 pathway in diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome rats,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effect of Peitu Yimu(strengthening spleen and soothing liver) acupuncture on intestinal mucosal barrier function and corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF)/CRF receptor 1 (CRFR1) pathway in rats with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D), so as to explore its underlying mechanism in alleviating IBS-D. METHODS: Forty female SD rats were randomly divided into blank, model, electroacupuncture (EA), and agonist groups, with 10 rats in each group. Except for the blank group, rats in the other groups were given folium sennae infusion by gavage combined with chronic unpredictable mild stress to establish IBS-D model. Rats in the EA group received acupuncture at ""Tianshu""(ST25) and EA at ""Zusanli""(ST36) and ""Taichong""(LR3) (2 Hz/15 Hz) on one side for 20 min, with the side chosen alternately every other day, for 14 days after modeling. Rats in the agonist group received acupuncture 30 min after intravenous injection of CRFR1 agonist urocortin, with the same manipulation method and time as the EA group. Before and after intervention, visceral pain threshold and stool Bristol scores were measured. Elevated plus maze test and open field test were used to detect anxiety and depression like behavior of rats. ELISA was used to detect the contents of CRF and CRFR1 in rats serum. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the positive expressions of CRF, CRFR1, zonula occludens protein 1(ZO-1), occlusal protein(Occludin), and closure protein 1 (Claudin-1) in colon tissue. RESULTS: Compared with the blank group, the visceral pain threshold, open arm time percentage (OT%), total distance of movement in the open field test, and positive expression of ZO-1, Occludin, and Claudin-1 in colon were decreased (P<0.01, P<0.05), while Bristol stool scores, serum CRF and CRFR1 contents, and positive expressions of CRF and CRFR1 in colon were increased (P<0.01) in the model group. After intervention and compared with the model group, the visceral pain threshold, OT%, total distance of movement in the open field test, and positive expressions of ZO-1, Occludin, and Claudin-1 in colon were increased (P<0.05, P<0.01), while Bristol stool scores, serum CRF and CRFR1 contents, and positive expressions of CRF and CRFR1 in colon were decreased (P<0.01) in the EA group；the Bristol stool scores, serum CRF content, and CRF positive expression in colon were significantly decreased in the agonist group (P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Peitu Yimu acupuncture can significantly improve visceral hypersensitivity and anxiety-depression state in IBS-D rats. Its mechanism may be related to the inhibition of CRF/CRFR1 pathway and restoration of intestinal tight junction protein expressions."
#7757,[Mechanism of thermo-sensitive moxibustion intervention in regulating Th17/Treg immune imbalance in the rat model of allergic rhinitis],"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effects of thermo-sensitive moxibustion on helper T cells(Th)17/regulatory T cells(Treg) immune imbalance and related cytokines in the rat model of allergic rhinitis (AR). METHODS: Thirty 8-week-old SD rats were randomly divided into a blank group (n=6), a model group (n=6), a western medicine group (n=6), and a moxibustion group (n=12). AR model was established by intraperitoneal injection of ovalbumin and aluminium hydroxide suspension for 14 d followed by intranasal administration of 20 μL of 12% ovalbumin for 10 days. After successful modeling, rats in the western medicine group received 8 μL of fluticasone propionate intranasally for 21 days;the moxibustion group was divided into a thermo-sensitive moxibustion group(n=4) and a traditional moxibustion group(n=4) based on whether the increase in tail temperature detected by an infrared thermal imager was greater than 1 °C. Both moxibustion groups received moxibustion on ""Feishu""(BL13) for 40 minutes, for 21 days. After the intervention, HE staining was used to observe the morphological changes of the nasal mucosa;ELISA was performed to measure serum interleukin(IL)-17A, IL-10, and transforming growth factor(TGF)-β1 contents;and immunohistochemical staining was used to observe the expression of IL-17A, retinoid-related orphan nuclear receptor γt(RORγt), IL-10, TGF-β1, and forkheadbox protein 3(FOXP3) in the nasal mucosa;flow cytometry was used to detect the percentage of Th17 and Treg in peripheral blood. RESULTS: Compared with the blank group, rats in the model group displayed swelling and deformation of the nasal mucosa, significant eosinophil infiltration, and increased serum IL-17A contents along with increased expression of IL-17A and RORγt in the nasal mucosa, as well as a significant rise in peripheral blood Th17 percentage (P<0.001, P<0.05);while serum IL-10 and TGF-β1 contents, along with FOXP3, IL-10, and TGF-β1 expression in the nasal mucosa and peripheral blood Treg percentage were significantly reduced (P<0.05, P<0.001). Compared with the model group, no significant thickening or eosinophil infiltration was found in the nasal mucosa of the western medicine, traditional moxibustion, or thermo-sensitive moxibustion groups, with improvements of the above indicators observed in all groups to varying extents (P<0.001, P<0.01, P<0.05). Compared with the thermo-sensitive moxibustion group, the western medicine group showed decreased expression of FOXP3 in the nasal mucosa (P<0.05), while serum IL-17A contents and nasal mucosal TGF-β1, RORγt, and IL-17A expressions were increased (P<0.001, P<0.01, P<0.05), with an increase in peripheral blood Th17 percentage(P<0.01) and a decrease in Treg cells (P<0.01);Traditional moxibustion group showed significantly reduced levels of serum IL-10 content and IL-10 expression in the nasal mucosa (P<0.001), along with higher expression of RORγt and IL-17A (P<0.001, P<0.01). Compared with the traditional moxibustion group and westernmedicine group, the thermo-sensitive moxibustion group had milder nasal mucosa swelling, less eosinophil infiltration. CONCLUSIONS: Thermo-sensitive moxibustion may alleviate allergic rhinitis by regulating Th17/Treg immune balance and related cytokines."
#7789,[Observation on the clinical efficacy of acupuncture in treatment of oculomotor nerve palsy guided by Biaoben Genjie theory],"OBJECTIVES: To observe the clinical effect of acupuncture in treatment of oculomotor nerve palsy guided by Biaoben Genjie theory (focusing on the distribution, connection and gathering of meridian qi in the body). METHODS: A total of 62 patients with oculomotor nerve palsy were selected according to inclusion criteria of the trial. They were randomly divided into a control group and an observation group, with 31 cases in each group. The conventional treatment with Western medicine was used in the two groups. Besides, in the control group, the regular acupuncture was provided, and in the observation group, acupuncture was delivered under the guidance of Biaoben Genjie theory. In the 2 groups, the treatment was given once daily, for 30 min each time and one course of treatment was composed of 6 d. Six courses were required with the interval of 1 d between two courses. The degree of diplopia, the degree of strabismus and the score of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) main symptoms were recorded before and after the treatment of the 2 groups separately, and the clinical efficacy was evaluated in each group. RESULTS: The degrees of diplopia and strabismus decreased significantly (P<0.05) compared with those before treatment in the 2 groups, and the degrees in the observation group were lower (P<0.05) than those of the control group. The TCM main symptoms score of both groups were reduced significantly (P<0.05) compared with those before treatment, and the score in the observation group was lower (P<0.05) than that of the control group. The effective rate was 93.55% (29/31) in the observation group, better (P<0.05) than that (83.87%, 26/31) of the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Acupuncture based on Biaoben Genjie theory can effectively relieve the ocular symptoms of the affected eyes in the patients with oculomotor nerve palsy, and the effect is better when compared with the regular acupuncture."
#7816,["Shugan Tiaoshen" needling improves depression after ischemic stroke by regulating AMPK-dependent autophagy],"OBJECTIVES: To observe the effect of ""Shugan Tiaoshen""(soothing the liver and regulating the mental activities) needling on the expressions of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and autophagy-related proteins in the prefrontal cortex of rats with depression after ischemic stroke (post-stroke depression), in order to explore its mechanisms underlying improvement of post-stroke depression behaviors. METHODS: A total of 60 male SD rats were randomly divided into sham operation (control), stroke, post-stroke depression, inhibitor, acupuncture, and acupuncture + inhibitor groups. The post-stroke depression model was established by occlusion of the middle cerebral artery and reperfusion (MCAO/R), combined with chronic unpredictable mild stimulation (CUMS). Rats in the inhibitor group received bilateral lateral ventricular injection of AMPK inhibitor (0.1 μmol, 10 μL). Manual acupuncture stimulation was applied to ""Baihui"" (GV20), ""Yintang"" (GV24(+)), ""Hegu"" (LI4), and ""Taichong"" (LR3) for the acupuncture group, once daily for 14 d. Rats in the acupuncture + inhibitor group received acupuncture treatment after 3 d of AMPK inhibitor injection. Neurologic impairment was assessed by Longa score. Behavioral assessment of depression was conducted by sucrose preference test and open field test. H.E. staining was used to observe the morphological changes of prefrontal cortex. Western blot was used to detect the protein expression levels of AMPK, p-AMPK, Beclin1, P62 and LC3 in the prefrontal cortex tissue. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to observe the ultrastructural changes of prefrontal neurons. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, only the total locomotor distance, the percentage of central area dwell time within 5 min and the p-AMPK/AMPK were significantly decreased (P<0.01) in the stroke group while Longa score was increased (P<0.01). Compared with the control group, the sucrose preference, total locomotor distance and the percentage of central area dwell time within 5 min, levels of p-AMPK/AMPK, Beclin1 and LC3Ⅱ/Ⅰ were significantly decreased (P<0.01, P<0.05), while Longa score and P62 expression was significantly up-regulated (P<0.01) in the post-stroke depression group. Compared with the post-stroke depression group, the sucrose preference, total locomotor distance and the percentage of central area dwell time within 5 min, and the levels of p-AMPK/AMPK, Beclin1, and LC3Ⅱ/Ⅰ were considerably increased (P<0.01), while P62 expression was notably decreased (P<0.05) in the acupuncture group. Comparison between the inhibitor group and the acupuncture+inhibitor group showed that the sucrose preference, total locomotor distance and the percentage of central area dwell time within 5 min, and the expression level of p-AMPK/AMPK were even lower in the former group than those in the latter group (P<0.05, P<0.01), and the expression level of P62 was higher in the former group than in the latter group (P<0.01). H.E. staining showed loose arrangement of prefrontal cortex neurons, reduced number, pyknotic and hyperchromatic nuclei, even with degeneration and necrosis of some neurons in the stroke, post-stroke depression and the inhibitor groups, while increase in neuronal number, with relatively complete structure and uniform stain observed in the acupuncture group. Results of TEM showed disrupted neuronal nuclear membrane, reduction in the number of mitochondria with moderate to severe swelling, and decrease or disappearance of the cristae, and transparent matrix with vacuolation in the post-stroke depression group, which was relatively milder (mild swelling, nearly normal structure and more autophagosome forming) in the acupuncture group and acupuncture+inhibitor group. CONCLUSIONS: ""Shugan Tiaoshen"" needling can improve the depressive symptoms in post-stroke depression rats, which may be related to its function in activating AMPK-dependent autophagy process."
#7826,[Study on the mechanism of acupuncture underlying improvement of functional dyspepsia with depression-like behavior in rats],"OBJECTIVES: To observe the effect of acupuncture on gastrointestinal motility, synaptic structure, brain-gut peptide and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) system in rats with functional dyspepsia (FD) and depression, so as to explore its mechanism underlying improvement of FD and depression-like behavior. METHODS: Forty male SD rats were randomly divided into control, model, acupuncture and medication (fluoxetine) groups with 10 rats in each group. The model of FD with depression comorbidity was established by multi-factor stress conditioning (chronic unpredictability stimulation + modified tail-clamp irritation stimulation+intermittent fasting) for 28 d. Acupuncture was applied to ""Baihui"" (GV20), bilateral ""Zusanli""(ST36) and ""Zhongwan"" (CV12) for 20 min, once daily for 7 d. The rats in the medication group received intraperitoneal injection of fluoxetine (20 mg/kg) once daily for 7 d. The suppression-like behavior was assessed by using tail suspension immobility time in 4 min, forced swimming immobility time in 4 min and sucrose preference rate. The gastrointestinal motility was assessed by using gastric emptying rate and small intestinal propulsion rate. The ultrastructural changes of myelin and synapse in the hippocampus were observed by transmission electron microscope. ELISA was used to detect the contents of serum somatostatin, motilin and 5-HT, and Western blot was used to detect the protein expression levels of tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (TPH1) and 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 3 (5-HT(3)R) in hippocampus. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the tail suspension immobility time and forced swimming immobility time were significantly increased (P<0.05), the sucrose preference rate, gastric emptying rate and small intestinal propulsion rate, contents of serum somatostatin, motilin and 5-HT, and the protein expression levels of TPH1 and 5-HT(3)R in the hippocampus were significantly decreased (P<0.05) in the model group. In comparison with the model group, the tail suspension immobility time and forced swimming immobility time were significantly decreased (P<0.05), whereas the sucrose preference rate, gastric emptying rate and small intestinal propulsion rate, contents of serum somatostatin, motilin and 5-HT, and the protein expression levels of TPH1 and 5-HT(3)R in the hippocampus were significantly increased (P<0.05) in the acupuncture group. Compared with the model group, the changes in behavioral indexes, number of synapses, serum 5-HT content, hippocampal TPH1 and 5-HT(3)R protein expression levels in the medication group were same as those in the acupuncture group (P<0.05). Outcomes of transmission electron microscopy displayed that in the model group, the hippocampus had obvious myelin degeneration and lysis, fewer microfilaments and microtubules, blurred mitochondria with loss of a large number of organelles, which was relatively milder in both acupuncture and medication groups. Both acupuncture and medication interventions evidently reversed modeling-induced reduction in the number of hippocampal synapses (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Acupuncture can improve the gastrointestinal motility and hippocampal synaptic damage in rats with FD and depression, which may be related to its functions in up-regulating the levels of brain-gut peptides and 5-HT system."
#7831,[Study on the antihypertensive mechanism of acupuncture at "Renying" (ST9) and "Zusanli" (ST36) via gastrin/cholecystokinin B receptors],"OBJECTIVES: To observe the effect of acupuncture on serum gastrin content and urinary sodium excretion in spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR), so as to explore its potential mechanism in the treatment of hypertension. METHODS: Thirty-two male SHRs were randomly divided into model, hydrochlorothiazide, acupuncture and sham acupuncture groups, with 8 rats in each group, and 8 male Wistar-kyoto rats were taken as the control group. Rats in the hydrochlorothiazide group received gavage of hydrochlorothiazide solution (10 mg·kg(-1)·d(-1)), once daily for 4 weeks. Acupuncture was applied to bilateral ""Renying"" (ST9) and ""Zusanli"" (ST36) or non-acupoint on both sides for rats in the acupuncture and sham acupuncture groups, with manual stimulation every 10 minutes for a total of 20 minutes, once a day for a total of 4 weeks. The systolic blood pressure of the tail-artery was measured before and 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks after the intervention. HE staining was used to observe the pathological changes in renal tissue. Serum gastrin contents were detected using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Urinary sodium content was measured by atomic absorption spectrometry. The expression levels of cholecystokinin B receptor (CCKBR) and Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase proteins in renal tissue were detected by Western blot, and the mRNA expression levels of CCKBR and the α1 subunit of Na(+)/K(+)- ATPase (ATP1A1) were detected by fluorescence quantitative PCR. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the systolic blood pressure of the tail artery in the model group were increased significantly before intervention and at the 1(st), 2(nd), 3(rd) and 4(th) weeks of intervention (P<0.05). Before intervention, the 24 h urine volume of the model, hydrochlorothiazide, acupuncture and sham acupuncture groups were decreased significantly (P<0.05). After intervention, the 24 h urine volume and urinary sodium excretion in the model group were significantly decreased (P<0.05)；the expression levels of CCKBR protein and mRNA in renal tissue were significantly decreased (P<0.05)；the expression levels of Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase protein and ATP1A1 mRNA were significantly increased (P<0.05)；the glomerulus was mildly congested with a small amount of lymphocyte infiltration. Compared with the model group, the systolic blood pressure of the tail artery in the hydrochlorothiazide and the acupuncture groups were decreased significantly at the 2(nd), 3(rd) and 4(th) weeks of intervention (P<0.05)；the 24 h urine volume and urinary sodium excretion in the hydrochlorothiazide and the acupuncture groups were significantly increased (P<0.05)；the serum gastrin content and the expression levels of CCKBR protein and mRNA in renal tissue were significantly increased (P<0.05)；the expression levels of Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase protein and ATP1A1 mRNA were significantly decreased (P<0.05)；there were no obvious pathological changes in renal tissue. A small number of lymphocyte focal infiltration around blood vessels was observed in the kidney tissue of the sham acupuncture group. CONCLUSIONS: Acupuncture can significantly reduce the tail artery systolic blood pressure of SHR, which may be related to its effect in increasing serum gastrin content and CCKBR expression, inhibiting sodium pump reabsorption, thus promoting urinary sodium excretion."
#7864,[Mechanism of electroacupuncture in improving obesity with insulin resistance by regulating the balance of Th17 and Treg cells through SIRT1],"OBJECTIVES: To observe the effect of electroacupuncture (EA) on silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1) and the balance of Th17 and Treg in the adipose tissues of obese rats with insulin resistance, and to explore the mechanisms by which EA improves insulin resistance and obesity. METHODS: Male Wistar rats were randomly divided into 5 groups:normal group, model group, EA group, sham EA group, and combination group, with 8 rats in each group. An insulin resistance obesity model was established using a high-fat diet. Rats in the EA group received EA at ""Zhongwan"" (CV12), ""Guanyuan"" (CV4), ""Zusanli"" (ST36), and ""Fenglong"" (ST40), with the needles retained for 10 min each time. The sham EA group underwent superficial needling 5 mm beside the acupoints of the EA group, with electrodes clamped but not powered, while the remaining procedures were identical to those in the EA group. The combination group was administered Sirtinol solution via tail vein injection, with the EA intervention identical to that in the EA group. All interventions were conducted 3 times a week (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday) for 8 weeks. Body mass, Lee's index and glucose infusion rate (GIR) were measured before and after the intervention. Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests (IPGTT) were conducted in the 6(th) week of the intervention period to test the blood glucose level. After the intervention, the percentages of Th17 and Treg cells in the adipose tissue were detected by flow cytometry and the Th17/Treg ratio was calculated, while the relative expression levels of SIRT1, acetylated nuclear factor-κB (AC-NF-κB), and interleukin-17 receptor A (IL-17A) proteins in the adipose tissue of rats in each group were analyzed by Western blot. RESULTS: Compared with the normal group, the model group showed increased body mass and Lee's index (P<0.05), elevated blood glucose level in IPGTT at all time pionts(P<0.05), decreased GIR (P<0.05), increased percentages of Th17 cells (P<0.05) and decreased percentages of Treg cells (P<0.05) in adipose tissue, and increased Th17/Treg ratio (P<0.05), the expression of SIRT1 protein was decreased (P<0.05) while the expression of Ac-NF-κB and IL-17A proteins were increased (P<0.05) in adipose tissue. Compared with the model group, the EA group showed a significant decrease in body mass and Lee's index (P<0.05), significantly reduced blood glucose level in IPGTT at all time points (P<0.05), increased GIR (P<0.05), decreased percentages of Th17 cells (P<0.05) and increased percentages of Treg cells (P<0.05) in adipose tissue, and reduced Th17/Treg ratio (P<0.05), the expression of SIRT1 protein was increased (P<0.05) while the protein expressions of Ac-NF-κB and IL-17A were decreased (P<0.05) in adipose tissue. Compared with the EA group, the combination group exhibited increases in body mass and Lee's index (P<0.05), elevated blood glucose level at 30, 60, and 120 min post-glucose injection in IPGTT (P<0.05), and decreased GIR (P<0.05), the percentage of Th17 cells was increased (P<0.05) and the Th17/Treg ratio was larger (P<0.05) in adipose tissue, and the expression of SIRT1 protein was reduced (P<0.05) while the protein expressions of Ac-NF-κB and IL-17A were increased (P<0.05) in adipose tissue. CONCLUSIONS: EA can reduce body mass and improve insulin sensitivity in obese rats, and its mechanism may be related to the activation of SIRT1, which regulates the balance of Th17/Treg and inhibits inflammatory responses."
#7879,Effect of electroacupuncture intervention on angiogenesis in psoriasis mice,"OBJECTIVES: To observe the effect of electroacupuncture (EA) stimulation of ""Zusanli""(ST36) and""Xuehai""(SP10) on the angiogenesis of the local injured skin tissue in mice with psoriasis, so as to explore its mechanisms underlying improvement of psoriasis-induced skin lesions. METHODS: A total of 24 female BALB/c mice aged 6-8 weeks were randomly divided into control, model and EA groups, with 8 mice in each group. The psoriasis-like skin lesion model was established by application of 5% imiquimod (IMQ) cream to the mice's back skin, 62.5 mg/d, for 7 days after local depilation, and the mice of the control group received local application of an equal amount of petroleum jelly once a day for 7 days. EA stimulation (2 Hz/100 Hz) was applied to ST36 and SP10 for 30 min, once daily for 7 consecutive days. Photos of the topical injured skin at the back were taken every day, and the severity of psoriasis lesions (psoriasis area and severity index ［PASI］) was scaled. Following H.E. staining, the morphological changes in the injured skin tissue were observed with epidermal thickness analyzed, and the Masson staining was used to observe the proportion of collagen fibers in the injured skin tissues. Immunohistochemical method was used to detect the expression of microvascular markers CD31 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and the microvascular density (MVD) was calculated. Western blot was used to detect the expression levels of CD31, VEGF proteins and mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPK) signaling pathway related proteins p38, phosphorylated p38 (p-p38), extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK), p-ERK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p-JNK in the injured skin tissue. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the mice in the model group showed an evident increase in the erythema score, scales score, skin thickening score and PASI score, epidermal thickness, proportion of the collagen fibers, MVD value of CD31 and VEGF, and expression levels of CD31 and VEGF proteins, and p-p38/p38, p-ERK/ERK and p-JNK/JNK ratios in the injured skin tissue (P<0.001, P<0.01). In contrast to the model group, the EA group had a significant decrease in the levels of all the indexes mentioned above (P<0.05, P<0.01, P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: EA intervention can improve the psoriasis-like skin lesions induced by IMQ in mice, which may be related with its functions in down-regulating the expression of angiogenic related factors CD31 and VEGF proteins and MAPK signaling pathway related proteins in the topical injured skin tissue."
#7933,Acupuncture for reducing the south to reinforce the north on executive function and sleep structure in patients with chronic insomnia disorder of heart-kidney disharmony,"OBJECTIVES: To observe the efficacy of acupuncture for reducing the south to reinforce the north on executive function, sleep structure and sleep quality in patients with chronic insomnia disorder of heart-kidney disharmony. METHODS: A total of 100 patients with chronic insomnia disorder of heart-kidney disharmony were randomized into an acupuncture group (50 cases, 1 case dropped out) and a western medication group (50 cases, 2 cases dropped out). Acupuncture for reducing the south to reinforce the north was applied at Baihui (GV 20) and bilateral Shenmen (HT 7), Sanyinjiao (SP 6), Shenmai (BL 62), Zhaohai (KI 6), Xinshu (BL 15), Shenshu (BL 23) in the acupuncture group, once a day, 5 days a week. Lorazepam tablet was given orally in the western medication group, 0.5-1 mg a time, once a day. Both groups were treated for 4 weeks. The Stroop color-word test (SCWT) indexes (the time consuming and the correct number of card A, B, C and the Stroop interference effect [SIE]), sleep structure indexes (total sleep time [TST], sleep latency [SL], wake after sleep onset [WASO], sleep efficiency [SE], non-rapid eye movement period 1 [N1], non-rapid eye movement period 2 [N2], non-rapid eye movement period 3 [N3], rapid eye movement period [REM]) and Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) score were observed before and after treatment in the two groups. RESULTS: After treatment, the time consuming of card B and C, the time consuming and the correct number of SIE, SL, WASO, N1, N2, as well as the sub-item scores and total score of PSQI were decreased (P<0.05, P<0.01), the correct number of card A, B and C, TST, SE, N3 and REM were increased (P<0.01) compared with those before treatment in the acupuncture group; the time consuming of card C and SIE, the correct number of card A and SIE, TST, SE, REM were increased (P<0.05, P<0.01), SL, WASO, N1, as well as the sub-item scores of sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, sleep efficiency, daytime function and total score of PSQI were decreased (P<0.01) compared with those before treatment in the western medication group. After treatment, in the acupuncture group, the time consuming of card C, the time consuming and the correct number of SIE, N1, N2, as well as the sub-item scores of sleep quality, sleep dysfunction, daytime function and total score of PSQI were lower than those in the western medication group (P<0.01), the correct number of card B and C, N3, REM were higher than those in the western medication group (P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Acupuncture for reducing the south to reinforce the north can improve the executive function of patients with chronic insomnia disorder of heart-kidney disharmony, adjust the sleep structure, and improve the night sleep quality and daytime body function."
#7989,Research trends of acupuncture therapy on insomnia in two decades (from 1999 to 2018):a bibliometric analysis,"OBJECTIVES: We aimed to evaluate the global scientific output of research of acupuncture on insomnia and explore the hotspots and frontiers from 1999 to 2018, by using bibliometric methods. METHODS: Articles about acupuncture therapy on insomnia were retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC). We used Citespace V to analyze publication years, journals, countries, institutions, authors and cited authors. We plotted the reference co-citation network and key words to analyze the research hotspots and trends. RESULTS: Until August 31, 2018 31, 2018, a total of 292 records in acupuncture therapy on insomnia research were identified from 1999 to 2018. The number and rate of the annual publication gradually increased. Respectively, SLEEP and J NEUROPSYCH CLIN N (journal of neuropsychiatry and clinical neurosciences) ranked the first in the frequency and centality of cited joural. Among countries, China ranked highest in the number of publications and the top 3 institutes were in Hong Kong. Chung KF and Yeung WF were the most productive authors and YEUNG WF ranked the first in the cited authors. In the ranking of frequency and in cited reference, the first was the article published in by CAO HJ and KALAVAPALLI R. 'Randomized controlled trial' had a high frequncy and centrality in keyword. CONCLUSIONS: A higher degree of acceptance acupuncture was obtained in the Asian. Recently, systematic reviews and clinic trials most focused on electrocacupuncture and acupressure among the acupuncture therapy."
#8011,"Effects of acupuncture on obstructive sleep apnea severity, blood pressure control and quality of life in patients with hypertension: A randomized controlled trial","Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common condition among patients with hypertension and treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) can decrease blood pressure (BP). However, CPAP is not well tolerated by a significant proportion of patients. The authors investigated the effects of acupuncture on OSA severity and BP control in patients with hypertension. Hypertensive patients with mild to moderate OSA (apnea-hypopnea index, 5-30 events/hr) were randomly assigned to receive acupuncture or sham-acupuncture treatment. Patients were assessed at baseline and after 10 acupuncture sessions using polysomnography, 24-hr ambulatory BP monitoring and a quality of life questionnaire. Forty-four patients (34% men; mean age, 57.0 ± 5.4 years; body mass index, 29.6 ± 3.2 kg/m(2) ; apnea-hypopnea index, 16.3 ± 6.7 events/hr) completed the study. There were no differences in pre-post-intervention apnea-hypopnea index, daytime or nocturnal BP, or quality of life between the acupuncture and sham-acupuncture groups (p > .05). Acupuncture therapy in hypertensive patients with OSA did not reduce OSA severity, daytime or nocturnal BP, or quality of life."
#8042,Loss of visual information in neglect: the effect of chromatic- versus luminance-contrast stimuli in a "what" task,"One to four vertical bars were tachistoscopically presented at various eccentricities along the horizontal meridian to patients with right brain damage and neglect (n=7) and to a control group of right brain damaged patients without neglect (n=4). Luminance contrast stimuli and isoluminant chromatic contrast stimuli were used. The patients' task was to report the number of bars. With luminance stimuli the neglect patients' discrimination in the left visual field was reduced, particularly at the most leftward position tested (ca 20 degrees ) where about 20% of the bars were omitted. The loss of information was limited to luminance contrast stimuli. When chromatic contrast stimuli were used, accuracy was comparable in the two hemifields and between groups of patients. The differential pattern of results for chromatic and luminance contrast stimuli is consistent with the hypothesis of a selective deficit of the magno-cellular pathway in neglect."
#8081,Why do patients turn to complementary medicine? An empirical study,"Over 250 patients from three complementary medicine practices-acupuncture, osteopathy and homoeopathy-completed a questionnaire rating 20 potential reasons for seeking complementary treatment. The reasons that were most strongly endorsed were ""because I value the emphasis on treating the whole person'; ""because I believe complementary therapy will be more effective for my problem than orthodox medicine'; ""because I believe that complementary medicine will enable me to take a more active part in maintaining my health'; and ""because orthodox treatment was not effective for my particular problem'. Five factors were identified, in order of importance: a positive valuation of complementary treatment, the ineffectiveness of orthodox treatment for their complaint, concern about the adverse effects of orthodox medicine, concerns about communication with doctors and, of less importance, the availability of complementary medicine. Groups were compared, using analysis of covariance to control for demographic differences between the three patient groups. Osteopathy patients' reasons indicated they were least concerned about the side effects of orthodox medicine and most influenced by the availability of osteopathy for their complaints. Homoeopathy patients were most strongly influenced by the ineffectiveness of orthodox medicine for their complaints, a fact which was largely accounted for by the chronicity of their complaints. Results are discussed in terms of the limited research in this area. Future studies should separate the reasons for beginning complementary treatment from the reasons for continuing it. It is possible, for instance, that the failure of orthodox medicine is the strongest motive for seeking complementary treatment but that, once treatment has been experienced, other more positive factors become more important."
#8157,Strong Manual Acupuncture Stimulation of "Huantiao" (GB 30) Reduces Pain-Induced Anxiety and p-ERK in the Anterior Cingulate Cortex in a Rat Model of Neuropathic Pain,"Persistent neuropathic pain is associated with anxiety. The phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (p-ERK) in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) plays an important role in pain-induced anxiety. Acupuncture is widely used for pain and anxiety. However, little is known about which acupuncture technique is optimal on pain-induced anxiety and the relationship between acupuncture effect and p-ERK. The rat model was induced by L5 spinal nerve ligation (SNL). Male adult SD rats were randomly divided into control, SNL, strong manual acupuncture (sMA), mild manual acupuncture (mMA), and electroacupuncture (EA) group. Bilateral ""Huantiao"" (GB 30) were stimulated by sMA, mMA, and EA, respectively. The pain withdrawal thresholds (PWTs) and anxiety behavior were measured, and p-ERK protein expression and immunoreactivity cells in ACC were detected. PWTs increased significantly in both sMA and EA groups. Meanwhile, anxiety-like behavior was improved significantly in the sMA and mMA groups. Furthermore, the overexpression of p-ERK induced by SNL was downregulated by strong and mild manual acupuncture. Therefore, strong manual acupuncture on bilateral ""Huantiao"" (GB 30) could be a proper therapy relieving both pain and pain-induced anxiety. The effect of different acupuncture techniques on pain-induced anxiety may arise from the regulation of p-ERK in ACC."
#8172,Effect of blinding with a new pragmatic placebo needle: a randomized controlled crossover study,"Placebo control is a useful method for determining the efficacy of a therapy. In acupuncture researches, the preferred method for placebo control is acupuncture using a placebo needle that has a blunt tip and achieves no skin penetration. We performed a crossover study to validate the blinding effect of a new type of placebo needle. Sixty volunteers were randomized to receive acupuncture using 2 types of needles with different sequences: sequence AB, involving first the pragmatic placebo needle and then the real needle, and sequence BA, in a reverse order. Placebo acupuncture was performed by administering the placebo needle through an adhesive pad without skin penetration on the acupoints LI4, RN12, BL25, and BL36. Real acupuncture was performed by needling through the pad and penetrating the skin to 15 mm using a real needle on the same acupoints. The acupuncture was administered every other day with 3 sessions for 1 type of needle. The primary outcome was the perception of needle penetration. Besides degree of acupuncture pain, type, and degree of needle sensation, needle acceptability and factors influencing the subject blinding effect were assessed. Needle penetration was felt by 100%, 90% (54/60), 88.3% (53/60), and 95% (57/60) of volunteers receiving placebo acupuncture and 98.3% (59/60), 96.7% (58/60), 95% (57/60), and 95% (57/60) of volunteers receiving real acupuncture on LI4, RN12, BL25, and BL36, respectively. Differences of the volunteers' perception of needle penetration between the placebo needle and real needle were not significant for the 4 acupoints (all P > 0.05). Volunteers experienced fewer distension sensations (P = 0.01), a lower degree of needle sensation (P = 0.007), and less pain (P = 0.006) during placebo acupuncture than during real acupuncture. The placebo needle was more easily accepted than the real needle (OR = 1.63, 95% CI, 1.01-2.64). The influences of age, sex, educational level, acupuncture experience, needle sensation, acupuncture pain, and needle acceptability on volunteers' perception of needle penetration were not significant. The pragmatic placebo needle is a valid control for acupuncture research. It produces a good subject blinding effect with a similar appearance to conventional acupuncture needles and no skin penetration when applied."
#8174,"Are all placebo effects equal? Placebo pills, sham acupuncture, cue conditioning and their association","Placebo treatments and healing rituals have been used to treat pain throughout history. The present within-subject crossover study examines the variability in individual responses to placebo treatment with verbal suggestion and visual cue conditioning by investigating whether responses to different types of placebo treatment, as well as conditioning responses, correlate with one another. Secondarily, this study also examines whether responses to sham acupuncture correlate with responses to genuine acupuncture. Healthy subjects were recruited to participate in two sequential experiments. Experiment one is a five-session crossover study. In each session, subjects received one of four treatments: placebo pills (described as Tylenol), sham acupuncture, genuine acupuncture, or no treatment rest control condition. Before and after each treatment, paired with a verbal suggestion of positive effect, each subject's pain threshold, pain tolerance, and pain ratings to calibrated heat pain were measured. At least 14 days after completing experiment one, all subjects were invited to participate in experiment two, during which their analgesic responses to conditioned visual cues were tested. Forty-eight healthy subjects completed experiment one, and 45 completed experiment two. The results showed significantly different effects of genuine acupuncture, placebo pill and rest control on pain threshold. There was no significant association between placebo pills, sham acupuncture and cue conditioning effects, indicating that individuals may respond to unique healing rituals in different ways. This outcome suggests that placebo response may be a complex behavioral phenomenon that has properties that comprise a state, rather than a trait characteristic. This could explain the difficulty of detecting a signature for ""placebo responders."" However, a significant association was found between the genuine and sham acupuncture treatments, implying that the non-specific effects of acupuncture may contribute to the analgesic effect observed in genuine acupuncture analgesia."
#8176,Minimal acupuncture is not a valid placebo control in randomised controlled trials of acupuncture: a physiologist's perspective,"Placebo-control of acupuncture is used to evaluate and distinguish between the specific effects and the non-specific ones. During 'true' acupuncture treatment in general, the needles are inserted into acupoints and stimulated until deqi is evoked. In contrast, during placebo acupuncture, the needles are inserted into non-acupoints and/or superficially (so-called minimal acupuncture). A sham acupuncture needle with a blunt tip may be used in placebo acupuncture. Both minimal acupuncture and the placebo acupuncture with the sham acupuncture needle touching the skin would evoke activity in cutaneous afferent nerves. This afferent nerve activity has pronounced effects on the functional connectivity in the brain resulting in a 'limbic touch response'. Clinical studies showed that both acupuncture and minimal acupuncture procedures induced significant alleviation of migraine and that both procedures were equally effective. In other conditions such as low back pain and knee osteoarthritis, acupuncture was found to be more potent than minimal acupuncture and conventional non-acupuncture treatment. It is probable that the responses to 'true' acupuncture and minimal acupuncture are dependent on the aetiology of the pain. Furthermore, patients and healthy individuals may have different responses. In this paper, we argue that minimal acupuncture is not valid as an inert placebo-control despite its conceptual brilliance."
#8275,Acupuncture and allergic rhinitis,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Allergic rhinitis has a high prevalence and negatively impacts quality of life. Patients commonly use complementary and integrative modalities to help alleviate their symptoms of allergic rhinitis, with approximately one in five receiving acupuncture. This article reviews the evidence base on the efficacy/effectiveness, safety and cost-effectiveness of acupuncture for allergic rhinitis. RECENT FINDINGS: Our review of the medical literature from January 2013 through December 2014 revealed that there is research demonstrating efficacy and effectiveness for acupuncture in the treatment of allergic rhinitis, as well as improvement of quality of life and quality-adjusted life-years. SUMMARY: There are high-quality randomized controlled trials that demonstrate efficacy and effectiveness for acupuncture in the treatment of both seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis. Smaller head-to-head studies also show some preliminary benefit of acupuncture when compared with antihistamines, but these had a variety of methodological limitations. Further studies of higher quality are needed, particularly with a focus on comparative effectiveness research."
#8333,Effect of Acupressure on Procedural Pain in Children: A Systematic Review,"PURPOSE: Acupressure is a complementary treatment method performed using fingers and hands to maintain the body's energy balance by stimulating acupuncture points. In recent studies, acupressure has been widely used for minimally invasive procedural (venous assess, intravenous (IV) cannulation, intramuscular injection, heel lancing) pain management in children. This study aims to systematically review the studies that evaluate the effectiveness of acupressure on minimally invasive procedural pain in children. DESIGN: This study is a systematic review of literature. METHODS: Studies were obtained by screening literature on this topic using the databases PubMed, EBSCO, Scopus, Google Scholar and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. The keywords ""Acupressure,"" ""Child,"" ""Pain,"" and ""Procedural"" were used when screening the literature. The studies selected were those published from January 1, 2000 to January 1, 2022 that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The PRISMA checklist was used when performing this systematic review. The Oxford Center for Evidence-Based Medicine Levels of Evidence Working Group (2011) table was used to assess the level of evidence. The procedures for this systematic review were preregistered in the PROSPERO (CRD42022320155) database. FINDINGS: Of the 12,624 records identified, 10 nursing studies that met the research selection criteria were included in the advanced analysis. These papers were further reviewed for their study design, adequacy of randomization and concealment of allocation, blinding of participants, interventions, and outcome measurements. CONCLUSIONS: Acupressure has been shown to be effective in relieving minimally invasive procedural pain in children. This review begins to establish a credible evidence base for the use of acupressure in minimally invasive procedural pain relief in pediatric age groups. The implication for nurses includes incorporating acupressure into their practice as an alternative therapy for children who suffer from minimally invasive procedural pain."
#8358,"Risk factors, genotype 6 prevalence, and clinical characteristics of chronic hepatitis C in Southeast Asian Americans","PURPOSE: Although infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) affects 32 million individuals from Southeast Asia, little is known about the mode of HCV acquisition and the epidemiology of chronic hepatitis C (CHC) in these individuals. Our goal was to examine risk factors for HCV acquisition, prevalence, and clinical characteristics of HCV genotype 6 compared with genotypes 1 and 2/3 in Southeast Asian (SEA) patients. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study of 308 consecutive SEA Americans with CHC evaluated by five gastroenterologists from January 2000 to December 2008 at two community clinics in northern California via medical record review, using a case report form. RESULTS: A significant proportion of patients (41%) could not recall any specific risk factors for HCV acquisition. The most commonly reported risk factor in patients who reported at least one risk factor was history of surgeries (34%), followed by blood transfusion (25%) and acupuncture (13%). Among patients with core sequence testing for HCV genotype (n = 181), the most common HCV genotypes were genotype 1 (42%) and genotype 6 (41%), followed by genotype 2/3 (17%). There were no major differences in the clinical and virological characteristics between the different genotype groups (1 vs. 2/3 vs. 6). CONCLUSION: HCV genotype 6 is as common as genotype 1 in SEAs. Commonly known risk factors for HCV acquisition were not readily identifiable in a large proportion of SEA Americans (41%) and may not be useful in identifying at-risk individuals for HCV screening in this population."
#8469,Clinical Evidence of Acupoint Stimulation for Primary Dysmenorrhea: A Systematic Review and Updated Meta-Analysis,"PURPOSE: Meridian-based acupoint stimulation is increasingly used for primary dysmenorrhea (PD), yet its evidence remains inconsistent. This systematic review aims to evaluate efficacy and safety of both invasive and noninvasive acupoint stimulation for PD through analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). METHODS: The PROSPERO registration number is CRD42024586857. PubMed, Excerpta Medica Database (Embase), Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Web of Science, Scopus, VIP Database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Wanfang Database were searched up to May 20, 2024. Methodological quality was assessed using the revised Cochrane risk of bias, version 2 tool. Data were synthesized using random-effects models and presented with forest plots. The primary outcomes were assessed based on pain intensity measured using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) or effective rates, and safety measured by adverse reaction rates. The secondary outcomes included self-reported symptoms and quality of life, uterine hemodynamics, and serum prostaglandin contents. RESULTS: A total of 22 eligible RCTs with 1955 participants (range 44 to 216) were included. Compared with no treatment or sham treatment, acupoint stimulation demonstrated moderate pain reduction (standardized mean difference [SMD] -2.96, 95% confidence interval [CI] -4.39 to -1.53). Compared with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), acupoint stimulation showed both immediate effects (post-first-treatment SMD -2.85, 95% CI -4.06 to -1.64) and sustained benefits (3 cycles SMD -1.58, 95% CI -2.43 to -0.73; following 3 cycles SMD -3.74, 95% CI -5.57 to -1.90), particularly with invasive techniques. The incidence of adverse events did not differ significantly between groups (relative risk [RR] 0.94, 95% CI 0.26 to 3.33). The GRADE certainty of the evidence ranged from low to moderate, owing to considerable risk of bias and high heterogeneity. CONCLUSION: Current evidence suggests that acupoint stimulation may reduce pain intensity in primary dysmenorrhea without increasing adverse reactions, particularly long-term."
#8508,[Comparison of local differential luminance sensitivity (dls) between Oculus Twinfield Perimeter and Humphrey Field Analyzer 630 (HFA I) in normal volunteers of varying ages],"PURPOSE: Purpose of this study was to compare age-corrected normal values of differential luminance sensitivity (dls) of the Oculus Twinfield Perimeter with those of the Humphrey Field Analyzer 630 (HFA I). Furthermore, naso-temporal and superior-inferior asymmetries in the central visual field were analyzed. METHODS: 72 ophthalmologically normal volunteers, 12 per decade, were examined with both perimeters using a 4-2 dB bracketing strategy with two reversals for threshold estimation. A biometric model, which fits a hill of vision to the data, was developed. The age-related hills, created by the model, were compared between the instruments and analyzed for asymmetries. RESULTS: The normal dls values for the Twinfield perimeter were about 1.5 dB above those of the HFA I. The shape of the hill in regard to slope in corresponding locations did not differ substantially. The decline of local differential luminance sensitivity showed a nonlinear correlation to age: it remained almost constant up to the 4th decade, with a steeper decline beyond that age. A naso-temporal as well as a superior-inferior asymmetry was found. Along the vertical meridian, the slope of the hill was steeper in the superior part than in the inferior. At an excentricity of 20 degrees we found a superior-inferior difference of 2.1 dB for the HFA and of 1.8 dB for the Twinfield perimeter benefitting the inferior meridian. Along the horizontal meridian there was a distinct difference in regard to the shape of the hill. The sensitivity was greater in the temporal half of the visual field than in the nasal. At an excentricity of 30 degrees, the difference was about 2.75 dB for the HFA and 2.5 dB for the Twinfield perimeter. These asymmetries seem to appear in all age groups. Unfortunately, the exact influence of age on the appearing asymmetries cannot be quantified by the used model. CONCLUSION: The normal dls values benefit the Twinfield for about 1.5 dB compared to the HFA. There seems to be a critical age of about 40 - 50 years, beyond which a decline of dls becomes manifest."
#8518,The Opioid-Sparing Effect of Acupuncture After Abdominal Surgery: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocol,"PURPOSE: Routine overprescribing of postoperative opioid analgesics may induce side effects and correlate with chronic opioid use following surgery. This review aims to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture for opioid-sparing effects in patients who underwent abdominal surgery. METHODS: Eleven databases in different languages, including English (Ovid MEDLINE, CENTRAL, EMBASE, CINAHL), Chinese, Korean, and Japanese, will be searched. Randomized controlled trials using acupuncture for postoperative pain control in adult patients undergoing abdominal surgery will be screened. All randomized controlled trials comparing acupuncture with no treatment, sham acupuncture, and conventional treatments will be included. The Cochrane risk of bias tool will be used to assess the risk of bias. The primary outcome will consist of a cumulative opioid consumption. Additionally, the number of cumulative opioid analgesic demands/requests, the time to initial opioid analgesic usage, postoperative pain, opioid-related side effects, and adverse events of acupuncture will be assessed. The mean differences or risk ratios with a 95% confidence interval will be calculated to estimate the pooled effect of acupuncture when it is possible to conduct a meta-analysis. RESULTS: This study could confirm the effect of opioid-sparing on acupuncture after abdominal surgery. CONCLUSION: This study would evaluate the evidence on the effectiveness of acupuncture after abdominal surgery with a focus on opioid intake. It provides evidence to support decision-making on applying acupuncture for postoperative management. REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42022311155."
#8529,[The Effect of Multifocal Toric Lens Rotation on Visual Quality],"PURPOSE: The aim of the study was evaluation and comparison of rotational stability and the effect of multifocal toric intraocular lens rotation (T-MIOL) at visual quality of two types of intraocular lens AcrySof IQ ReSTOR Toric SND1Tx (Alcon Laboratories, Inc.) and AT LISA toric 909M (Carl Zeiss Meditec AG). There was evaluated a pseudophakic dysphotopsia based on patients subjective feelings as well as the independence on glasses and overall satisfaction with the visual quality after T-MIOLs were implanted. METHODS: The retrospective study included 68 eyes (100 %) of 34 patients, who underwent an uncomplicated cataract surgery with multifocal toric intraocular lens was implanted. 68 eyes were divided into two groups. Group A consisted of 48 eyes (70,6 %) with AcrySof IQ ReSTOR Toric SND1Tx and group B included 20 eyes (29,4 %) with AT LISA toric 909M multifocal toric intraocular lenses were implanted. The T-MIOL position, planned axis and misalignment were evaluated one week and 6 months after surgery. Surgical lens reposition was indicated in case of worsening visual quality due to T-MIOL rotation from its planned position. RESULTS: In the group of 68 eyes, the mean uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA) before surgery was 0,08 (n = 48) in group A and 0,09 (n = 20) in group B. The mean UDVA after T-MIOL were implanted improved to 0,83 ± 0,06 (n = 48) in group A and 0,75 ± 0,08 (n = 20) in group B. The mean UDVA in patients before T-MIOL surgical rotation was 0,57 ± 0,03 (n = 5) in group A and 0,59 ± 0,08 (n = 5) in group B. At six months after T-MIOL surgical rotation, the uncorrected distance visual acuity was 1,0 in both groups (p = 0.70). The surgical rotation of T MIOL was performed in 10 eyes (14,7 %) of 68 eyes (p = 0.48), in group A (n = 48) in 5 eyes (10,4 %) and in group B (n = 20) in 5 eyes (25,0 %). Mean deviation from the planned axis was 8,2 ± 1,78 degrees in group A and 13,4 ± 3,04 degrees in group B. At six months postoperatively, the T-MIOL rotational stability showed less than 5 degrees for all surgically rotated lenses in both groups. Mean cylinder decreased in all patients from -2,92 ± 1,85Dcyl to -0.85 ± 0.61Dcyl after surgery. The mean spherical equivalent for all patients decreased from 0,56 ± 4,75D to 0,06 ± 1,33D after surgery. Presence of disturbing fotic phenomenon had reported 11 (32.4 %) of 34 patients, 9 of them they were subsequently indicated T-MIOL reposition. All 34 patients were able to perform normal daily tasks independently on spectacle correction. At six months after surgery, there was very high satisfaction with the quality of postoperative vision in both groups. CONCLUSION: Implantation of toric multifocal intraocular lens, both of AcrySof ReSTOR Toric SND1Tx (Alcon Laboratories, Inc.) and AT LISA toric 909M (Zeiss Meditec AG Carl) in cataract patients is safe and effective method to correct corneal astigmatism and maintain the visual multifocality. Early surgical T-MIOL reposition should be performed to put the T-MIOL to planned axis in steepest meridian if unwanted lens rotation is identified. KEY WORDS: cataract surgery, toric multifocal intraocular lens, rotation, rotational stability, quality of vision."
#8536,Comparison of an automated confrontation testing device versus finger counting in the detection of field loss,"PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to compare an automated confrontation visual field testing (ACV) device with traditional finger-counting confrontation visual field testing (FCV). METHODS: Forty-five eyes of 45 subjects with glaucoma, 5 eyes of 5 subjects with neurologic disease and 15 eyes of 15 normal subjects (age matched to the subjects with glaucoma by frequency) were tested on both ACV and FCV. All subjects with glaucoma and neurologic disease had visual field loss on white-on-white Humphrey perimetry (HVF). The FCV was performed in 8 meridians in a normally lighted room, whereas ACV was performed in a darkened room. The ACV device consisted of a black rectangular box with 4 1.0-mm red light-emitting diodes at each corner and a fixation hole at the center. Four automated randomized presentations were presented, and the subject was asked to identify the number of red lights seen (from 1 to 4). Any point missed on any of the presentations on either test was recorded as a failure. RESULTS: All normal subjects passed both tests. FCV detected field loss in 33.0% of glaucomatous eyes, whereas ACV detected field loss in 58% of glaucomatous eyes (P < 0.001). Subjects with glaucoma who passed FCV but failed ACV had an average mean deviation of -7.77 dB on HVF, compared with subjects who failed both FCV and ACV, who had an average mean deviation of -19.74 dB on HVF (P < 0.001). All subjects with absolute visual field loss because of advanced glaucoma or neurologic disease failed both tests. No subject who passed ACV failed FCV. CONCLUSIONS: Gross confrontation visual field testing using an automated testing device has a greater sensitivity in the detection of moderate visual field loss than finger counting confrontation visual fields."
#8549,The consultation and relational empathy measure: an investigation of its scaling structure,"PURPOSE: The Consultation and Relational Empathy (CARE) measure is recommended to evaluate the quality of care. However, there is no evidence that it is valid in rehabilitation. Aims were to examine the internal construct (factorial) validity of the CARE in the assessment of the patient-therapist relationship. METHOD: CARE data were part of an experimental study of acupuncture and different currently used acupuncture placebo controls, including 213 patients (age 66.8, SD 8.3, 58% female) with chronic stable hip or knee pain of mechanical origin, waiting for a joint replacement. CARE was completed two weeks into the study and on completion, two weeks later. DATA ANALYSIS: Cronbach alpha, factor analysis and Rasch analysis. RESULTS: Internal construct validity was supported (82% of variance explained by the first factor; fit to the Rasch model χ(2) = 18.2, P = 0.57). CARE was unidimensional, had local independence of items, good item fit, absence of Differential Item Functioning and invariance over time. Three percent of people did not complete items 9 & 10. CONCLUSIONS: CARE satisfied strict criteria for internal construct validity. An interval scale transformation is available that can be used in clinical practice and research. Further work is required to investigate item non-response and how this may be dealt with in clinical settings."
#8566,The efficacy of acupuncture in treating urge and mixed incontinence in women: a pilot study,"PURPOSE: The propose of this pilot study was to examine the feasibility of recruiting women into a clinical trial designed to examine the efficacy of acupuncture in treating urge and mixed urinary incontinence (UI) and the feasibility of performing the planned study procedures. We also sought to determine if there was preliminary evidence to suggest that acupuncture may be effective in reducing UI and improving general health-related and disease-specific quality of life and if a sham acupuncture needle is an effective placebo intervention. DESIGN: This pilot study was a double-blinded, randomized, clinical trial. Subjects were randomly assigned to a true or sham (placebo control) acupuncture group. Both true and sham acupuncture treatments were performed twice a week for 6 weeks. All subjects were evaluated at the completion of the 6-week intervention and 4 weeks later. SAMPLE: The sample consisted of 9 women between the ages of 44 and 66 years with urge or mixed urge and stress UI at least twice a week for a minimum of 3 months. MEASURES: Subjects completed a 1-week bladder diary at baseline and at 1 and 4 weeks postacupuncture to assess the impact of acupuncture on incontinence episodes. Quality of life was measured at baseline and at 1 and 4 weeks postacupuncture using the Medical Outcomes Short-Form (general health- related quality of life) and the Incontinence Impact Questionnaire and Urogenital Distress Inventory (incontinence-specific quality of life). RESULTS: It was feasible to recruit subjects and perform the planned study procedures. Subjects randomized to the true acupuncture group had a mean 63.30% (median = 65.99%) reduction in daytime accidents/day at 1 week postacupuncture and 67.47% reduction (median = 75.76%) at 4 weeks postacupuncture. In contrast, the mean reduction in daytime accidents was 18.88% (median = 19.64%) at 1 week and 16.67% (median = 0%) at 4 weeks post-sham acupuncture. There were no significant group differences in changes in the scores on the quality-of-life measures. Subjects' perceptions about whether they had received the true or sham acupuncture were not significantly better than one would expect by chance. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this pilot study support the need for additional research examining the efficacy of acupuncture in the treatment of UI in women, the feasibility of performing study procedures, and the use of a sham needle as placebo in acupuncture studies."
#8650,Off-axis partial coherence interferometry in myopes and emmetropes,"PURPOSE: This study describes the axial and peripheral dimensions of myopic and emmetropic eyes in a wide range of retinal locations using a non-contact optical biometer (Zeiss IOLMaster) based upon the principle of partial coherence interferometry. Understanding the optical properties of the peripheral eye may provide insight into myopia development and the possible effects on off-axis visual performance. METHODS: Fifty-two myopes (spherical equivalent between -2.00 and -9.62 D) and 27 emmetropes (spherical equivalent between -0.50 and +0.50 D) with astigmatism less than 0.75 D, participated in this study. Axial length and peripheral cornea to retina lengths were measured using partial coherence interferometry at the fovea and up to ± 30° eccentricity along the horizontal and vertical meridian in 10° steps. Relative cornea to retina length was calculated by subtracting the axial length from that obtained at each peripheral location. RESULTS: Our results showed significant differences between refractive groups for both horizontal (p < 0.001) and vertical (p < 0.001) meridians, illustrating that the retinal shape profile is significantly different between myopes and emmetropes. Myopic eyes exhibited a greater rate of change in cornea to retina lengths with increasing eccentricity than emmetropic eyes, with the temporal portion of the retina exhibiting the steepest shift. In addition, significant nasal-temporal asymmetry was observed, which was more pronounced in myopic eyes. CONCLUSIONS: Axial and peripheral cornea to retina dimension measurements, using partial coherence interferometry, suggest that myopic eyes tend toward an ellipsoid shape compared to the spherical emmetropic eyes."
#8718,Intraocular lens bicylindric power calculation method: Using both flat and steep K readings to improve intraocular lens power prediction,"PURPOSE: To compare and analyze the accuracy of the refractive outcomes obtained in intraocular lens power calculation using the classical calculation method with mean keratometry (K) and the calculation method with both K meridians presented in this article. METHODS: A total of 62 eyes of 62 subjects who were undergoing cataract surgery were included in this study. Optical biometry was performed using mean K and Haigis formula for classical intraocular lens calculation methods to achieve intraocular lens power; 4 weeks after surgery, prior to medical discharge, subjective refraction was made. Alternatively, intraocular lens power was calculated with bicylindric method using both keratometry readings, obtaining spherocylindrical refractive expected outcomes. Finally, results obtained with intraocular lens calculation methods, bicylindric method, and Haigis formula were compared. RESULTS: Spherical equivalent calculated by classical intraocular lens calculation methods using Haigis formula (H-SE) was -0.027 ± 0.115 D and using bicylindric method (B-SE) was -0.080 ± 0.222 D. Achieved spherical equivalent obtained 4 weeks after surgery (A-SE) was -0.144 ± 0.268 D. Difference between H-SE and A-SE was -0.117 D (p = 0.002). Difference between B-SE and A-SE was not significant (-0.054 D, p = 0.109). Analysis in refraction groups showed a positive correlation between A-SE confronted to B-SE and H-SE (r = 0.313; p = 0.013 and r = 0.562; p < 0.001, respectively). This indicated a reliability in ametropic group prediction of 0.767 in H-SE and 0.843 in B-SE. CONCLUSION: Intraocular lens calculation with bicylindric method could be more accurate and had more reliability than classical intraocular lens calculation method. Bicylindric method adds astigmatism control and provides a reliable expected spherocylindrical refraction."
#8720,Corneal backscatter in insulin-dependent and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus patients: a pilot study,"PURPOSE: To compare central corneal backscatter obtained from Scheimpflug images between patients with insulin-dependent and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM and NIDDM, respectively) and healthy controls. METHODS: Seven patients with IDDM (7 eyes), eleven patients with NIDDM (11 eyes), and sixteen healthy subjects (16 eyes) were included in this pilot study. Scheimpflug imaging system (Pentacam, Oculus Inc., Germany) was used to obtain optical sections of the cornea. Seven meridians were analyzed for each eye, oriented from 70° to 110°. Optical density values for the central 3-mm and 5-mm zones of the cornea were obtained by image analysis using external software. RESULTS: Corneal backscatter was significantly higher in the diabetic patients than in the controls for the central 3-mm (p=0.016) and 5-mm (p=0.014) zones. No significant differences in corneal backscatter were found between the IDDM and NIDDM groups for either zone (both p>0.05). In the NIDDM group, significant correlations were observed for both central zones between corneal backscatter and age (3 mm: r=0.604, p=0.025; 5 mm: r=0.614, p=0.022) and central corneal thickness (3 mm: r=0.641, p=0.017; 5 mm: r=0.671, p=0.012); this was not found in the IDDM group (p>0.05). The presence of diabetes showed a significant effect on central corneal backscatter (Kruskal-Wallis test, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Diabetic patients showed higher values of corneal light backscatter than healthy subjects. Corneal optical density analysis may be a useful tool for monitoring and assessing the ocular changes caused by diabetes."
#8780,Analysis of RPE morphometry in human eyes,"PURPOSE: To describe the RPE morphometry of healthy human eyes regarding age and topographic location using modern computational methods with high accuracy and objectivity. We tested whether there were regional and age-related differences in RPE cell area and shape. METHODS: Human cadaver donor eyes of varying ages were dissected, and the RPE flatmounts were immunostained for F-actin with AF635-phalloidin, nuclei stained with propidium iodide, and imaged with confocal microscopy. Image analysis was performed using ImageJ (NIH) and CellProfiler software. Quantitative parameters, including cell density, cell area, polygonality of cells, number of neighboring cells, and measures of cell shape, were obtained from these analyses to characterize individual and groups of RPE cells. Measurements were taken from selected areas spanning the length of the temporal retina through the macula and the mid-periphery to the far periphery. RESULTS: Nineteen eyes from 14 Caucasian donors of varying ages ranging from 29 to 80 years were used. Along a horizontal nasal to temporal meridian, there were differences in several cell shape and size characteristics. Generally, the cell area and shape was relatively constant and regular except in the far periphery. In the outer third of the retina, the cell area and shape differed from the inner two-thirds statistically significantly. In the macula and the far periphery, an overall decreasing trend in RPE cell density, percent hexagonal cells, and form factor was observed with increasing age. We also found a trend toward increasing cell area and eccentricity with age in the macula and the far periphery. When individuals were divided into two age groups, <60 years and ≥60 years, there was a higher cell density, lower cell area, lower eccentricity, and higher form factor in the younger group in the macula and the far periphery (p<0.05 for all measurements). No statistically significant differences in RPE morphometry between age groups were found in the mid-periphery. CONCLUSIONS: Human cadaver RPE cells differ mainly in area and shape in the outer one third compared to the inner two-thirds of the temporal retina. RPE cells become less dense and larger, lose their typical hexagonal shape, and become more oval with increasing age."
#8944,The Effect of Nonpharmacological Methods on Preoperative Anxiety in Breast Surgery Patients: A Meta-analysis,"PURPOSE: To investigate the effect of nonpharmacological methods on anxiety before breast surgery, using the meta-analysis method. DESIGN: A meta-analysis. METHODS: Nine electronic databases were searched to identify studies published up to October 2023. The study was carried out in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analyses 2020 and Cochrane 2021 recommendations. The Risk of Bias 2 tool was used to assess the risk of bias. Heterogeneity and publication bias were also assessed. FINDINGS: A search of 9 electronic databases identified 280 records. Six studies that met the inclusion criteria were eligible for meta-analysis. All the trials explained how the randomization was done. The studies selected were published between 2016 and 2022. A total of 519 female patients were included in the selected trials, 303 in the intervention group and 216 in the control group. The studies included aromatherapy, music, electro-acupuncture, and Yokukansan Kampo medicine practices. A meta-analysis was performed with anxiety levels measured immediately before surgery. In addition, a subgroup analysis was performed with trials that used anxiety-specific scales before surgery and trials that used aromatherapy. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this meta-analysis indicated a moderate efficacy of nonpharmacological approaches, whereas aromatherapy showed a relatively lower efficacy in reducing preoperative anxiety in breast surgery patients."
#8949,"Effects of metabolic abnormalities, hyperandrogenemia and clomiphene on liver function parameters among Chinese women with polycystic ovary syndrome: results from a randomized controlled trial","PURPOSE: To investigate the effects of metabolic abnormalities, hyperandrogenemia and ovulation induction by clomiphene/acupuncture on liver function parameters among women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial. All 1000 subjects were diagnosed as PCOS by modified Rotterdam criteria. Liver function parameters, metabolic panel and hormone profile were measured at baseline and after treatment. The relationship between liver parameters with metabolic, hormonal parameters and ovulation induction was examined. RESULTS: PCOS women with metabolic syndrome had higher liver enzyme levels but lower bilirubin and bile acid levels than without. PCOS women with hyperandrogenemia had higher liver enzyme, bilirubin levels than without. Correlation analyses showed that worsening of metabolic parameters was associated with higher liver enzyme levels but lower bilirubin and bile acid levels, while increased androgen levels were associated with higher liver enzyme, bilirubin and bile acid levels. Ovulation induction with clomiphene citrate could decrease bilirubin and bile acid levels, while acupuncture had no obvious effect on liver function. CONCLUSIONS: Among PCOS women, metabolic abnormalities and hyperandrogenemia impaired different liver function parameters. Clomiphene could decrease the bilirubin and bile acid levels while acupuncture had no obvious effect on liver function."
#8983,Quantitative analysis of retinal nerve fiber layer defect in early open-angle glaucoma with normal intraocular pressure,"PURPOSE: To quantitatively analyze the topographic features of localized retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) defects according to baseline intraocular pressure (IOP) level in cases of early primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective comparative study. METHODS: POAG patients meeting the following conditions were consecutively included: (1) baseline office-hour diurnal IOP ≤ 21 mmHg, (2) 1 localized RNFL defect as observed on red-free fundus photography, and (3) corresponding visual field defect. Defects' approximations to the macula (angle α) and width (angle ß) as well as the angle between the disc long axis and the vertical meridian line (angle Ɣ) were measured on red-free fundus photography. The corrected angle α was calculated as the difference between angles α and Ɣ. The defect area's RNFL thickness was calculated by means of optical coherence tomography's Advanced Extraction analysis utility. RESULTS: Comparative analysis was performed between 2 groups: 45 eyes of 45 patients with low-teen IOP (group A: highest IOP ≤ 15 mmHg) and 49 eyes of 49 patients with high-teen IOP (group B: lowest IOP > 15 mmHg). In group A, the mean baseline IOP was lower (12.9 ± 1.3 vs 17.1 ± 1.0 mmHg; P < .001), the corrected angle α was smaller (32.4 ± 15.1 vs 39.5 ± 13.1 degrees; P = .017), and the defect area's RNFL thickness was thinner (66.3 ± 16.8 vs 76.3 ± 14.9 μm; P = .003) than in group B; angle ß showed no intergroup difference (P = .230). CONCLUSIONS: In POAG patients with low-teen IOP relative to those with high-teen IOP, localized RNFL defects were closer to the macula. In addition, the RNFL thickness of the defect area was markedly thinner."
#8986,Prospective randomized comparison of phacoemulsification cataract surgery with a 3.2-mm vs a 5.5-mm sutureless incision,"PURPOSE: To report sutureless cataract surgery by phacoemulsification with a 3.2-mm surgical incision compared with a 5.5-mm surgical incision. METHOD: In a prospective, randomized, masked clinical trial of phacoemulsification cataract surgery, 55 eyes (55 patients) had a 3.2-mm incision and 56 eyes (56 patients) had a 5.5-mm incision. All incisions were in the superior vertical meridian, commenced 1.5 mm posterior to the limbus, and extended into the cornea for a total length of 2.5 to 3.0 mm. In a masked fashion, astigmatism was monitored by keratometry, and logMAR visual acuity was determined both with and without best correction throughout a mean follow-up of 33.9 months. RESULTS: Statistically significant differences were seen in favor of the 3.2-mm incision group at the final examination for astigmatism (Cravy analysis) and uncorrected visual acuity (-0.18 vs -0.88 diopter, P < .001; logMAR, 0.14 vs 0.26, P = .04). CONCLUSIONS: Over the long term, phacoemulsification with a 3.2-mm incision is associated with significantly less astigmatic shift and better uncorrected visual acuity than is phacoemulsification with a 5.5-mm incision. A small incision with a foldable intraocular lens has long-term benefits."
#9039,Rehabilitative effects of Transcutaneous Electric Nerve Stimulation on limb function in stroke patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"PURPOSE: We conducted a systematic review to assess the effectiveness of TENS in the rehabilitation of limb motor dysfunction following stroke. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We collected data from three databases, PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science, covering the earliest available date to April 2024, with a focus on randomized controlled trials that utilized TENS as an intervention for limb motor dysfunction after stroke, and extracted the main evaluation indicators before and after treatment, including the Fugl-Meyer Assessment for Upper Extremity (FMA-UE), Functional Independence Measure (FIM), and Composite Spasticity Scale (CSS). Meta-analysis was conducted using Review Manager 5.4.1 software. RESULTS: This systematic review included a total of 513 participants from 10 studies. The analysis revealed that TENS was found to be statistically more effective than sham TENS in improving upper limb function, with a standardized mean difference (MD) of 3.58 (95% CI: 0.88, 6.27). CONCLUSION: TENS has shown potential in improving limb motor function in post-stroke patients based on FMA-UE, FIM, and CSS scores. However, variations in stimulation frequency, sites, treatment schedules, and devices make the evidence insufficient for its reliable clinical use. Registration: CRD42023421759.TENS is effective in reducing spasticity and improving muscle strength and gait performance in stroke patients with lower limb dysfunction.A 100 Hz stimulation frequency is recommended for TENS to achieve optimal motor recovery outcomes.Electrode placement for TENS can be flexibly applied to acupuncture points, such as ST36 and GB34, or anatomically targeted muscle sites, such as the tibialis anterior and quadriceps.TENS, when combined with task-specific training, may produce sustained improvements in functional mobility and independence post-stroke.eng"
#9058,Massage therapy has short-term benefits for people with common musculoskeletal disorders compared to no treatment: a systematic review,"QUESTION: Is massage therapy effective for people with musculoskeletal disorders compared to any other treatment or no treatment? DESIGN: Systematic review of randomised clinical trials. PARTICIPANTS: People with musculoskeletal disorders. INTERVENTIONS: Massage therapy (manual manipulation of the soft tissues) as a stand-alone intervention. OUTCOME: The primary outcomes were pain and function. RESULTS: The 26 eligible randomised trials involved 2565 participants. The mean sample size was 95 participants (range 16 to 579) per study; 10 studies were considered to be at low risk of bias. Overall, low-to-moderate-level evidence indicated that massage reduces pain in the short term compared to no treatment in people with shoulder pain and osteoarthritis of the knee, but not in those with low back pain or neck pain. Furthermore, low-to-moderate-level evidence indicated that massage improves function in the short term compared to no treatment in people with low back pain, knee arthritis or shoulder pain. Low-to-very-low-level evidence from single studies indicated no clear benefits of massage over acupuncture, joint mobilisation, manipulation or relaxation therapy in people with fibromyalgia, low back pain and general musculoskeletal pain. CONCLUSIONS: Massage therapy, as a stand-alone treatment, reduces pain and improves function compared to no treatment in some musculoskeletal conditions. When massage is compared to another active treatment, no clear benefit was evident."
#9065,Effects of transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation on perioperative immune function and postoperative analgesia in patients undergoing radical mastectomy: A randomized controlled trial,"Radical mastectomy may lead to suppression of cellular immune function in patients with malignant tumors. Transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation (TEAS) is widely used in clinical practice. However, there have been relatively few studies on the effects of TEAS on postoperative analgesia and immune function. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of TAES on postoperative pain and immune function in patients undergoing radical mastectomy. A total of 65 patients were enrolled and allocated to either receive TEAS or sham TEAS. TEAS was implemented on bilateral Hegu (LI4), Neiguan (PC6) and Zusanli (ST36) acupoints simultaneously for 30 min before induction of anesthesia at 4 and 12 h post-operation. The primary outcomes included visual analogue scale (VAS) scores at 4 h (T(1)), 12 h T(2)), 24 h (T(3)) and 48 h (T(4)) post-operation, and serum levels of IL-2, IL-4, IFN-γ and the IL-2/IL-4 ratio at 30 min before TEAS (T(0)), T(1), T(2), T(3) and T(4). Secondary outcomes included the cumulative time of rescue analgesia within 48 h post-surgery, as well as the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) and pruritus. Compared with the sham TEAS group, postoperative VAS scores at T(2) and T(3), the total consumption of opioids in the patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump, pressing times of the PCA pump and the incidences of PONV and headache were significantly lower in the TEAS group. The serum levels of IFN-γ at T(3) and T(4), and the serum levels of IL-2 and the IL-2/IL-4 ratio at T(2), T(3) and T(4) were higher in the TEAS group compared with the sham TEAS group. By contrast, the serum levels of IL-4 were lower at T(2), T(3) and T(4) in the TEAS group compared with the sham TEAS group. The results indicated that TEAS could improve postoperative analgesia, reduce postoperative consumption of opioids and alleviate postoperative side effects. Simultaneously, TEAS was able to reverse decreased serum levels of IL-2 and IFN-γ, reduce the level of IL-4 and restore the balance of Th1/Th2, thereby partially attenuating perioperative immune function depression in patients with breast cancer. The current trial was registered prior to participant enrollment at www.chictr.org.cn (Clinical Trial no. ChiCTR1800017768)."
#9097,Acupuncture and heart rate variability: a systems level approach to understanding mechanism,"Recent research has elucidated several different mechanisms for acupuncture. However, the interrelationship between these mechanisms and how acupuncture affects complex physiological systems is still not understood. Heart rate Variability (HRV), the beat-to-beat fluctuations in the rhythm of the heart, results from the regulation of the heart by the autonomic nervous system (ANS). Low HRV is associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality and is a marker for a wide range of diseases. Coherent HRV patterns are associated with increased synchronization between the two branches of the ANS, and when sustained for long periods of time result in increased synchronization and entrainment between multiple body systems. There is strong evidence from randomized placebo controlled trials that acupuncture modulates HRV. This may represent a mechanistic pathway for global physiological regulation, which is congruent with East Asian medical theory. The ability of acupuncture to improve HRV could be used as a tool in acupuncture research and practice to monitor treatment effectiveness and the impact on quality of life."
#9145,Wrist-ankle acupuncture for the treatment of pain symptoms: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Routine acupuncture incorporates wrist-ankle acupuncture (WAA) for its analgesic effect, but WAA is not widely used in clinics due to incomplete knowledge of its effectiveness and concerns about less clinical research and because less people know it. This study aimed to assess the efficacy and possible adverse effects of WAA or WAA adjuvants in the treatment of pain symptoms. This study compared WAA or WAA adjuvant with the following therapies: western medication (WM), sham acupuncture (SA), or body acupuncture (BA). Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were searched systematically in related electronic databases by two independent reviewers. 33 RCTs were finally included, in which 7 RCTs were selected for meta-analysis. It was found that WAA or WAA adjuvant was significantly more effective than WM, SA, or BA in pain relief. There was nothing different between WAA and SA in adverse events, but WAA was marginally significantly safer than WM. Although both WAA and WAA adjuvant appeared to be more effective than WM, SA, or BA in the treatment of pain symptoms with few side effects, further studies with better and more rigorously designed are still necessary to ensure the efficacy and safety issue of WAA due to the poor methodology and small sample size of previous studies."
#9148,'Alternate-goal bias' in antisaccades and the influence of expectation,"Saccadic performance depends on the requirements of the current trial, but also may be influenced by other trials in the same experiment. This effect of trial context has been investigated most for saccadic error rate and reaction time but seldom for the positional accuracy of saccadic landing points. We investigated whether the direction of saccades towards one goal is affected by the location of a second goal used in other trials in the same experimental block. In our first experiment, landing points ('endpoints') of antisaccades but not prosaccades were shifted towards the location of the alternate goal. This spatial bias decreased with increasing angular separation between the current and alternative goals. In a second experiment, we explored whether expectancy about the goal location was responsible for the biasing of the saccadic endpoint. For this, we used a condition where the saccadic goal randomly changed from one trial to the next between locations on, above or below the horizontal meridian. We modulated the prior probability of the alternate-goal location by showing cues prior to stimulus onset. The results showed that expectation about the possible positions of the saccadic goal is sufficient to bias saccadic endpoints and can account for at least part of this phenomenon of 'alternate-goal bias'."
#9175,A frontoparietal network for spatial attention reorienting in the auditory domain: a human fMRI/MEG study of functional and temporal dynamics,"Several studies have identified a supramodal network critical to the reorienting of attention toward stimuli at novel locations and which involves the right temporoparietal junction and the inferior frontal areas. The present functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)\magnetoencephalography (MEG) study investigates: 1) the cerebral circuit underlying attentional reorienting to spatially varying sound locations; 2) the circuit related to the regular change of sound location in the same hemifield, the change of sound location across hemifields, or sounds presented randomly at different locations on the azimuth plane; 3) functional temporal dynamics of the observed cortical areas exploiting the complementary characteristics of the fMRI and MEG paradigms. fMRI results suggest 3 distinct roles: the supratemporal plane appears modulated by variations of sound location; the inferior parietal lobule is modulated by the cross-meridian effect; and the inferior frontal cortex is engaged by the inhibition of a motor response. MEG data help to elucidate the temporal dynamics of this network by providing high-resolution time series with which to measure latency of neural activation manipulated by the reorienting of attention."
#9181,Is elevated baseline SHBG associated with increased ovulation?,"Sexual hormone binding globulin (SHBG) is associated with the endocrine and reproductive systems. We aimed to investigate the role of SHBG in the reproductive process. Therefore, we conducted a secondary analysis of the PCOSAct (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome and Acupuncture Clinical Trial) study, which involved 21 sites in China and a total of 1000 women with PCOS. Out of these, 954 women with SHBG were included in the analysis. Through multivariate analysis of ovulation predictors, we found that age, BMI, estradiol, testosterone, and SHBG all showed a positive predictive value for ovulation (p = 0.0211, 0.0011, 0.0211, 0.0029, 0.0434, respectively). However, the LH to FSH ratio had a negative predictive value (p = 0.0539). Higher quartiles of SHBG were associated with a higher rate of ovulation, and per quartile increased was statistically significant (HR = 1.138, 95%CI [1.054,1.229]). The association remained significant even after adjusting for testosterone (HR = 1.263, 95%CI [1.059, 1.507]). On the other hand, quartiles of testosterone and estradiol did not exhibit any significant tendency toward ovulation. SHBG demonstrated predictive ability for ovulation, conception, pregnancy, and live birth (p < 0.05), and this correlation remained significant after adjusting intervention. Kaplan-Meier curves illustrated that increased levels of SHBG were a factor in high rates of ovulation, conception, and pregnancy. In comparison to other sexual hormones, a higher baseline level of SHBG was related to increased ovulation."
#9198,Effect of Time on Scleral Lens Settling and Change in Corneal Clearance,"SIGNIFICANCE: With the increase in the use of scleral contact lenses among practitioners, questions regarding lens settling are gradually gaining attention. This is because current studies support the notion that scleral lenses settle back over time. More research is needed to understand the exact cause and the factors that underpin such phenomenon. PURPOSE: The present study aims to assess the effect of time on topographic corneal clearance of three scleral contact lenses of varying sagittal depths. METHODS: Three scleral contact lenses were fitted to 20 subjects with previous diagnosis of keratoconus (n = 18) or pellucid marginal degeneration (n = 2). The fit was based on corneal sagittal height measured with the Visante optical coherence tomographer (OCT) at 15 mm along the horizontal meridian. To select an appropriate lens from the diagnostic lens set, values of 325 μm (lens 1), 375 μm (lens 2), and 425 μm (lens 3) were randomly added in sequence to the corneal sagittal height. Subjects wore each lens for 1 hour. Corneal clearance was measured at 10-minute intervals for 1 hour using a custom ultra-long OCT. To assess change in clearance, central point and two mid-peripheral points (+3 mm and -3 mm) along an 8-mm chord were measured by taking differences at each time point up to 1 hour. Measurements were repeated for the two other lenses. RESULTS: Mean central corneal clearance loss for all three lenses was 33.83 ± 48.40 μm. This was 26 ± 27 μm (13 ± 14 μm, +3 mm; 34 ± 37 μm, -3 mm), lens 1; 35 ± 59 μm (38 ± 61 μm, +3 mm; 52 ± 69 μm, -3 mm), lens 2; and 41 ± 54 μm (33 ± 26 μm, +3 mm; 52 ± 48 μm, -3 mm), lens 3, respectively. There was no significant difference (P = 0.06) at central and other locations for lens 1 (location and over time). There were significant differences for both lenses 2 and 3 (P < .001, P = .01, respectively) for all three locations and over time. CONCLUSIONS: There is a likelihood of clearance loss after 1 hour of lens wear. This varies between subjects, initial lens-fit relationship, and over time."
#9209,Advancing acupuncture research,"Since the early 1970s, acupuncture has been the subject of multiple animal experiments and randomized clinical trials. Our understanding of acupuncture from both the clinical and mechanistic perspectives has, as a result, grown tremendously. Yet the final word on acupuncture as a therapy remains mixed, largely due to the contradictory nature of the evidence. With some exception, what clinical conditions would benefit and how acupuncture physiologically operates remains unclear. The impediment to progress is found in three disjunctions in acupuncture research: (1) the biomedical need to standardize treatments creates uncertainty about whether we are studying acupuncture appropriately; (2) the variability in acupuncture styles creates ambiguity about whether we are studying the right style; and (3) the discrepancy between animal and human studies creates questions about whether we truly understand the underlying mechanism responsible for acupuncture's therapeutic effect. We propose that these disjunctions are best addressed with the use of ""manualized"" protocols in clinical trials that are linked with mechanistic studies. Through this approach, we can create a healthy dialogue between the medical and acupuncture communities and recognize the unique physiologic properties that may be found in each acupuncture style. To illustrate how this proposal may fundamentally change acupuncture research, we present diabetic neuropathy as a particularly interesting model because of its complex heterogeneous pathophysiology."
#9249,[Use of stimulation techniques in pain treatment],"Stimulation techniques (SB) include manipulation, acupuncture, acupressure, physiotherapy, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, reflexotherapy, laser treatment and epidural stimulation technique. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the scientific evidence for these techniques. The Cochrane Library and Medline were searched for all techniques from 2000 to date. Only randomised controlled studies written in English were included. Search words were used, such as; acupuncture and neck pain, shoulder pain, etc. In total 587 papers were identified for the following diseases; headache, neck pain, shoulder pain, elbow pain, low back pain and knee pain. 415 papers were excluded, and the remaining 172 papers, a total of 20,431 patients, are the basis for this study. The effect of acupuncture and epidural stimulation technique is scientifically well-supported. For the remaining techniques, the scientific evidence is dubious."
#9267,The Effectiveness of Trigger Point Dry Needling for Musculoskeletal Conditions by Physical Therapists: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,"Study Design Systematic review and meta-analysis. Background An increasing number of physical therapists in the United States and throughout the world are using dry needling to treat musculoskeletal pain. Objective To examine the short- and long-term effectiveness of dry needling delivered by a physical therapist for any musculoskeletal pain condition. Methods Electronic databases were searched. Eligible randomized controlled trials included those with human subjects who had musculoskeletal conditions that were treated with dry needling performed by a physical therapist, compared with a control or other intervention. The overall quality of the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation. Results The initial search returned 218 articles. After screening, 13 were included. Physiotherapy Evidence Database quality scale scores ranged from 4 to 9 (out of a maximum score of 10), with a median score of 7. Eight meta-analyses were performed. In the immediate to 12-week follow-up period, studies provided evidence that dry needling may decrease pain and increase pressure pain threshold when compared to control/sham or other treatment. At 6 to 12 months, dry needling was favored for decreasing pain, but the treatment effect was not statistically significant. Dry needling, when compared to control/sham treatment, provides a statistically significant effect on functional outcomes, but not when compared to other treatments. Conclusion Very low-quality to moderate-quality evidence suggests that dry needling performed by physical therapists is more effective than no treatment, sham dry needling, and other treatments for reducing pain and improving pressure pain threshold in patients presenting with musculoskeletal pain in the immediate to 12-week follow-up period. Low-quality evidence suggests superior outcomes with dry needling for functional outcomes when compared to no treatment or sham needling. However, no difference in functional outcomes exists when compared to other physical therapy treatments. Evidence of long-term benefit of dry needling is currently lacking. Level of Evidence Therapy, level 1a. J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2017;47(3):133-149. Epub 3 Feb 2017. doi:10.2519/jospt.2017.7096."
#9271,Addition of choice of complementary therapies to usual care for acute low back pain: a randomized controlled trial,"STUDY DESIGN: A randomized controlled trial. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effectiveness and cost of usual care plus patient choice of acupuncture, chiropractic, or massage therapy (choice) compared with usual care alone in patients with acute low back pain (LBP). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Few studies have evaluated care models with facilitated access to and financial coverage for adjunctive complementary and alternative medicine therapies. METHODS: A total of 444 patients with acute LBP (<21 days) were recruited from 4 clinical sites and randomized into 2 groups: usual care or choice. Outcomes included symptoms (bothersomeness), functional status (Roland), and satisfaction between baseline and 5 weeks, and cost of medical care in the 12 weeks after randomization. RESULTS: After 5 weeks, providing patients with a choice did not yield clinically important reductions in symptoms (median -4, [interquartile range -7, -2] for usual care, and -5 [-7, -3] for choice; P = 0.002) or improvements in functional status (-8 [-13, -2] for usual care, and -9 [-15, -4] for choice; P = 0.15). Although there was a significantly greater satisfaction with care in the choice group, this came at a net increase in costs of 244 dollars per patient. This consisted of a 99 dollars reduction in the average cost to the insurer for medical care but an additional cost of 343 dollars, for an average of 6.0 complementary and alternative medicine treatments per patient. CONCLUSIONS: A model of care that offered access to a choice of complementary and alternative medicine therapies for acute LBP did not result in clinically significant improvements in symptom relief or functional restoration. This model was associated with greater patient satisfaction but increased total costs. Future evaluations of this choice model should focus on patients with chronic conditions (including chronic back pain) for which conventional medical care is often costly and of limited benefit."
#9301,Short-term acupuncture therapy is of no benefit in patients with moderate persistent asthma,"STUDY OBJECTIVES: Acupuncture traditionally has been used to treat asthma. Nevertheless, only a few controlled studies have been performed to determine the efficacy of this treatment. Our study aimed to determine the efficacy of acupuncture in patients with moderate persistent asthma. METHODS: Twenty-three patients with moderate persistent asthma who had been treated only with inhaled beta(2)-agonists were randomly assigned to receive four sessions of real acupuncture (RA) or sham acupuncture (SA) in a blinded manner. After a washout period of 3 weeks, the patients were crossed over. Monitoring included FEV(1), methacholine challenge, daily peak flow (PF) variability, and the keeping of an asthma diary. RESULTS: Twenty of 23 patients completed the study. There was no significant change in FEV(1) following treatment. The mean (+/- SE) FEV(1) values before and after the RA were 73 +/- 4% and 73 +/- 3%, respectively (not significant [NS]). FEV(1) values before and after SA were 70 +/- 3% and 70 +/- 3%, respectively (NS). There was also no change in provocative methacholine concentration causing a 20% fall in FEV(1) (PC(20)) before and after treatment. The mean PC(20) values before and after RA were 0.92 +/- 0.42 mg/mL and 1.16 +/- 0.51 mg/mL, respectively (p = 0.71), while the PC(20) values before and after SA were 1.47 +/- 0.83 mg/mL and 1.11 +/- 0.79 mg/mL, respectively (p = 0.59). There was no change in the mean PF variability before and after the RA (1.6 +/- 3.1% and 1.8 +/- 2.3%, respectively [NS]). The PF variability before and after SA were 3.6 +/- 2.8% and 2.8 +/- 3.4%, respectively (NS). No significant difference was demonstrated for symptom scores or for the use of beta(2)-agonist inhalers (RA, 6.7 +/- 3.4; SA, 8.1 +/- 3.6; p = 0.58). CONCLUSION: In patients with moderate persistent asthma, a short course of acupuncture treatment resulted in no change in lung functions, bronchial hyperreactivity, or patient symptoms."
#9326,Assessment of non-pharmacological nursing strategies for pain management in tumor patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"SUMMARY BACKGROUND: Cancer is a multifactorial disease associated with intense pain and fatigue. Pain is the main discomfort experienced during cancer treatment, particularly as a major side effect of chemotherapy. OBJECTIVE: This study has aimed to investigate the effectiveness of non-pharmacological nursing strategies, including reflexology, aromatherapy, acupressure, massage therapy and acupuncture, in the management of cancer-associated pain. Moreover, it provides evidence-based recommendations for integrating these interventions into standard pain management protocols. SEARCH METHODOLOGY: We gathered data from three major online databases; PubMed, the Cochrane Library and Embase. For the analysis, we exclusively targeted randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions in managing cancer-related pain. No language restrictions were applied, and pain was considered the primary outcome measure. RESULTS: Seventeen RCTs (n = 1,070) were included in this meta-analysis from 166 eligible studies. The pooled effect size demonstrated that all evaluated non-pharmacological nursing strategies, including aromatherapy, massage, reflexology, acupressure and acupuncture significantly reduced cancer-related pain compared to usual care (p < 0.001). Moreover, the reflexology and massage showed negligible heterogeneity among other interventions. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis found the significant effectiveness of non-pharmacological nursing strategies, particularly reflexology and massage in reducing cancer-related pain. The findings support their integration into clinical practice, providing evidence-based recommendations for enhancing standard pain management protocols."
#9334,Pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches to temporomandibular disorder chronic pain: a narrative review,"Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) involve the temporomandibular joint and related structures, causing chronic pain, impaired jaw function, and reduced quality of life. TMD has multifactorial origins, including mechanical, neuromuscular, and inflammatory factors. Chronic TMD pain is difficult to manage due to its complex pathophysiology and the limited long-term effectiveness of existing treatments. A combination of pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies is essential for optimal pain management. This narrative review provides an integrative overview of current treatments for TMD-associated chronic pain. Pharmacological options discussed include analgesics, muscle relaxants, antidepressants, anticonvulsants, and botulinum toxin injections. Non-pharmacological strategies include physical therapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy, acupuncture, and lifestyle modifications. A comprehensive literature search was conducted using PubMed, Embase.com, Cochrane, and Evidence Alerts databases through October 2024. We focused on original research articles, randomized controlled trials, narrative and systematic reviews, and meta-analyses. Effective management of chronic TMD pain requires a multidisciplinary approach tailored to individual needs. Evidence supports the integration of physical and psychological therapies into treatment plans. Future research should aim to develop targeted interventions that address underlying mechanisms of TMD pain and evaluate the long-term outcomes of noninvasive therapies.TMD is a condition that causes pain and problems in the jaw joint and the muscles that control jaw movement. This can lead to long-term pain, trouble moving the jaw, and a lower quality of life. TMD has many causes, like stress on the joint, muscle problems, and swelling, which makes it hard to treat. Current treatments don’t always work well over time, so using a mix of different treatments is important for better pain relief. This review looked at both medicine-based and non-medicine treatments for TMD pain. Medicine treatments include painkillers, muscle relaxers, antidepressants, seizure medications, and Botox injections. Non-medicine treatments include physical therapy, therapy for mental health, acupuncture, and lifestyle changes. The authors searched medical research studies without date limits, focusing on high-quality studies. They found that the best way to treat chronic TMD pain is to combine medicine and non-medicine treatments, designed to meet each person’s physical and emotional needs.eng"
#9359,The effect of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation on sympathetic skin response,"The aim of present study was to determine whether combination of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) and acupuncture inhibits sympathetic nerve activity in healthy humans. Multiunit efferent postganglionic sympathetic activity was recorded with Toennies set. In this study, the aim was to obtain latency, amplitude and duration of sympathetic skin response (SSR) and skin temperature (ST) from both hands in 15 healthy subjects. Subjects randomly assigned and everybody participated in all the three groups [Control Group (CG), Acupuncture Group (AG) and Nerve Stimulation Group (NSG)]. TENS (2 Hz, 250 microsecond) was applied over the median nerve of the right elbow in NSG for 20 min, either, TENS was applied over (HE-7) point of the right hand in CG (TENS off) and AG (TENS on) for 20 min. SSR (lat, amp, dur) and ST data was recorded before TENS and for immediate, 5 min and 10 min post--TENS. ST was recorded in distal phalanx of index finger of both hands and SSR was recorded from both hands. TENS in CG did not affect ST and SSR following stimulation. TENS applied at AG and NSG caused a significant increase in ST (P = 0.001), significant increase in latency of SSR (P = 0.001), significant decrease in amplitude of SSR (P = 0.001) and no significant changes were observed in duration of SSR (P > 0.05). Then statistical analysis showed differences between both of groups (AG & NSG) for ST and SSR post--TENS. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation inhibits sympathetic nerve activity in healthy humans."
#9375,Transcutaneous electroacupuncture improves dyspeptic symptoms and increases high frequency heart rate variability in patients with functional dyspepsia,"The aim of the study was to evaluate the therapeutic value and possible mechanisms of transcutaneous electroacupuncture (TEA) in a double-blind and cross-over study in patients with functional dyspepsia (FD). Twenty-seven patients with FD were enrolled and the study consisted of two parts: (i) acute effects of TEA at PC6 and ST36 on gastric slow waves and heart rate variability and (ii) chronic (2 weeks) effects of TEA at PC6 and ST36 on dyspepsia symptoms, gastric slow waves, heart rate variability and neuropeptide Y (NPY) and motilin. The results of this study are: (i) The dyspepsia symptom score was decreased by 55% at the end of chronic TEA and the improvement was significant (P < 0.01); (ii) the high frequency (HF) assessed from the spectral analysis of heart rate variability was markedly increased with both acute TEA (76% increase, P = 0.01) and chronic TEA (75% increase, P = 0.025); (iii) gastric slow waves were not altered by either acute or chronic TEA; and (iv) the plasma level of NPY but not motilin was increased after chronic TEA. Non-invasive and needleless transcutaenous electroacupuncture at ST36 and PC6 markedly improves dyspepsia symptoms and the improvement may be associated with the increase in HF heart rate variability and the modulation of NPY."
#9426,The effect of a new treatment based on somatosensory stimulation in a group of patients with somatically related tinnitus,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a new treatment consisting of stretching, posture training, and auricular acupuncture immediately and at a 3-month followup. This method has not been tested previously. From an original pool of 41 potential subjects, we recruited 24 (12 men, 12 women; ages 18-70 years) into this study and divided them from a waiting list into either a treatment group or a control group. We measured mobility of neck and posture; measured severity of tinnitus by the Klockhoff test and the visual analog scale (VAS); and measured grade of anxiety and depression with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. We also used the Mann-Whitney U-test to determine statistical significance. The statistical analysis demonstrated a significant decrease of tinnitus in the treatment group as compared with the control group, according to the VAS before and after treatment (p < .001) and at follow-up after 3 months (p < .01). We also observed a significant decrease of tinnitus according to the Klockhoff test before and after treatment (p < .001) and at follow-up after 3 months (p < .01). Our study indicates that this method, based on somatosensory stimulation, may be a useful and alternative treatment of somatic tinnitus."
#9433,The Efficacy and Safety of Extracorporeal Shockwave Therapy versus Acupuncture in the Management of Chronic Prostatitis/Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome: Evidence Based on a Network Meta-analysis,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT) and acupuncture therapy for patients with chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS).We searched electronic databases including PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase and web of science from its inception to June 1, 2021. The randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared ESWT and acupuncture in the management of CP/CPPS were identified. A network meta-analysis was conducted with the software of STATA 14.0.Nine RCTs with 525 patients were enrolled in our analysis. The results revealed that both ESWT and acupuncture were significantly better than the sham procedure in the outcomes of total score of NIH-CPSI, pain subscore, urinary symptoms subscore, QoL subscore, IPSS score, the IIEF score and response rates (p < .05). Both ESWT and acupuncture were well-tolerated and had no obviously increased adverse events. Compared with acupuncture, ESWT was associated with better short term (<4w) and mid-term (8-12 w) efficacy of total score, pain subscore, urinary symptoms subscore, and QoL subscore of NIH-CPSI, IPSS score, IIEF score, and response rate. However, ESWT did not present better long-term (<24 w) outcomes than acupuncture in total score, pain subscore, urinary symptoms subscore, and QoL subscore of NIH-CPSI.Both ESWT and acupuncture were effective and well-tolerated in the management of CP/CPPS. ESWT seemed to have better short (<4 w) and mid-term (8-12 w) efficacy but similar long-term (>24 w) efficacy than acupuncture."

Patients were divided into three groups in clinic, namely the pre-treatment group (n=20), post-treatment group (n=20) and healthy group (n=20), patients meeting corresponding conditions were recruited in the voluntary principle to accept PHN pain evaluation and protomics tests respectively. Compared with the pre-treatment group, visual analogue scale (VAS) in post-treatment group obviously reduced, protomics indexes like MFG-ES, Lymphotoxin beta/TNFSF3, IL-19, Neuritin, NCAM-1/CD56 and PECAM-1/CD31 obviously changed. The Zhuang medicine medicated thread moxibustion can treat the postherpetic neuralgia patient with herpes zoster, its internal mechanism is to possibly change the protomics indexes like MFG-ES, Lymphotoxin beta/TNFSF3, IL-19, Neuritin, NCAM-1/CD56 and PECAM-1/CD31."
#9506,Complementary medicine and the general practitioner,"The attitudes to complementary medicine of a random sample of general practitioners in Avon were assessed. A questionnaire was sent to 200 general practitioners, of whom 145 responded. The treatments studied were acupuncture, homoeopathy, herbal medicine, spinal manipulation, faith healing, and hypnosis. Of the 145 general practitioners, 55 (38%) had received some training in complementary medicine and 22 (15%) wished to arrange training. Overall, general practitioners knew little about the techniques of complementary medicine. Despite this 86 doctors (59%) thought that the complementary techniques being assessed were useful to their patients: 110 (76%) had referred patients for this type of treatment over the past year to medically qualified colleagues and 104 (72%) had referred patients to non-medically qualified practitioners. Most (93%) of those who responded believed that complementary practitioners needed statutory regulation; only 3% thought that they should be banned. The method of regulation most favoured was through a central and independent national body. General practitioners' views about complementary techniques were most influenced (in a positive manner) by observed benefits to their patients (41%) and personal or family experience of benefit (38%). The results of the study show a surprisingly high interest in complementary medicine among general practitioners in the Avon area."
#9518,[Influence of application-impulse stimulation treatment on airway's reactivity with asthma],"The authors observed the effect of application-impulse stimulation treatment on 184 patients with asthma, using the main index of airway's reactivity, in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel study. The airway's reactivity of the treated group got improved significantly (P less than 0.001), but that of the control group was not changed sharply (P greater than 0.05). The airway's reactivity and clinical effect between the groups have significant meaning (P less than 0.001, P less than 0.001). The result suggests that application-impulse stimulation treatment is a safe and effective method for preventing and treating asthma."
#9533,[Thoughts on improving the design quality of acupuncture clinical randomized controlled trials],"The British Medical Journal published the Acupuncture research album which carried viewpoints, expert consensus, research methods and other genres of papers, providing an authoritative reference for standardizing the design of clinical randomized controlled trial (RCT) of acupuncture and improving the quality of clinical research. Based on the experts' consensus of ""acupuncture album"" on RCT, combining clinical practice and the related literature reports, and many existing problems existing in the design, we, in the present paper, analyzed ways to improve the design quality of clinical RCT of acupuncture, starting from improving the methodological quality and repeatability of clinica RCT, so as to provide methodological guidance for the design of clinical trials and to promote the standardization of clinical trials of acupuncture."
#9562,[Corneal distortion induced by speculum--studies with computer-assisted corneal topography],"The corneal distortion induced by the presence of an eyelid speculum was analysed by the Videokeratoscope-Eyesys Corneal Analysis System (EYESYS), with a Barraquer type speculum (B group) in 22 normal eyes and with a Kratz-Barraquer type speculum in 38 normal eyes (KB group). The following differences were evaluated in the 2 groups: intraocular pressure (IOP), refractive power, change in astigmatism of the Cravy method, and corneal refractive power before and after the specula were put in the interpalpebral fissure. Significant differences were found in the IOP in the KB group, in spherical equivalent in the B and KB groups, and in corneal refractive power in the B groups. Then the 38 eyes of the KB group were divided into two groups by the average level of proptosis and the average difference of IOP, and the corneal refractive power of the two groups was compared by statistical analysis. Significant difference was found in the direction of 0 degree/ 180 degrees in the group with higher than average proptosis and in the direction of 90 degrees/ 270 degrees in the group with higher than average difference in IOP. Multiple regression analysis suggested that higher grades of proptosis were related with steeper vertical meridians and that wider palpebral fissures were associated with steeper horizontal meridians. Multiple regression also showed that the speculum did not cause corneal distortion with the proper relation between level of proptosis and width of the palpebral fissure."
#9607,Central post-stroke pain--the effect of high and low frequency TENS,"The effect of high (conventional) and low frequency (acupuncture-like) transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (Hi-, Lo-TENS) was tested in 15 patients with central post-stroke pain. During the initial 16 day trial of stimulation ipsilateral and contralateral to the pain, 4 patients obtained pain relief. Three of them benefitted from ipsilateral Hi- and Lo-TENS. Two patients also obtained pain relief with contralateral stimulation. Three patients continued to use TENS ipsilaterally with good effect at follow-up 23-30 months after the initial trial. In one-third of the patients, TENS temporarily increased the pain."

The clinical randomized controlled trial (RCT) of acupuncture-moxibustion for agrypnia were collected. The literature and document on acupuncture-moxibustion RCT for the treatment of agrypnia that published from January of 2001 to March of 2012 was searched with computer in PubMed, CNKI, Wanfang and VIP database. According to Cochrane Handbook 5. 1. 0, the bias risk and quality assessment were performed on every included trial and RevMan 5. 0 software was applied to make the Meta analysis. Totally 14 researches were included, involving 2662 cases. The Meta analysis showed that the differences of total effective rate between acupuncture-moxibustion and clinical routine treatment were significant [RR = 1.16, 95% CI (1.12, 1.19), Z = 9.32, P < 0.000 01]. The results indicate that total effective rate of acupuncture-moxibustion for agrypnia is obviously superior to that of clinical routine treatment, meaning clinical efficacy of acupuncture-moxibustion is served credit."
#9637,Effects of the electrical stimulation of myofascial trigger points with tension headache,"The effects of electrical stimulation by simple pocket size stimulator were evaluated on myofascial trigger points by pain threshold (PTH) algometry. The study consisted 14 patients with 76 treated trigger points in randomly selected double blind cross-over study protocol. The effects of 30 seconds stimulation increased the PTH values 0.58 kg/cm2 in study group, but only 0.13kg/cm2 in controls (p < 0.01). These results suggested that the stimulation had positive effects on myofascial trigger points, but these effects were seen only on the treated points."
#9640,[Clinical efficacy of Bushen Huoxue Anshen therapy in treating perimenopausal sleep disorder with kidney deficiency and blood stasis],"The efficacy and safety of traditional Chinese medicine and acupuncture in the treatment of kidney-deficiency and bloodstasis perimenopausal sleep disorders were evaluated. A total of 67 subjects who completed the study were randomly divided into two groups. The traditional Chinese medicine group was orally given Bushen Huoxue Anshen Fang,and the acupuncture group was given acupuncture treatment. Both groups were treated for three consecutive courses of treatment,with a course of treatment of 30 days. The changes of PSQI score,improved Kupperman score,TCM syndromes,serum sex hormone,coagulation,routine blood and urine,liver and kidney function and electrocardiogram were observed before and after treatment. After treatment,the total effective rates of Chinese medicine group and acupuncture group were similar or respectively 91. 43% and 87. 50%. The scores of PSQI,improved Kupperman and TCM syndromes in both groups decreased significantly( P<0. 05). The effect of improving Kupperman score in TCM group was better than that in acupuncture group( P< 0. 01). The effect of improving PSQI and TCM syndromes was similar to that in acupuncture group. The levels of serum FSH and LH were decreased in both groups( P<0. 05),but with no significant difference between the two groups; the level of serum E2 was increased in both groups,but with no significant difference. Compared with before treatment,PT was increased in traditional Chinese medicine group( P<0. 05),but with no significant difference in APTT,TT and FIB before and after treatment; PT and TT were prolonged in acupuncture group( P<0. 05),but with no significant difference in APTT and FIB before and after treatment. The effect of improving PT and TT in the acupuncture group was better than that in the traditional Chinese medicine group( P<0. 05). The results showed that TCM and acupuncture had similar therapeutic effects on perimenopausal sleep disorder of kidney deficiency and blood stasis type,and were safe and reliable. The mechanism was related to the improvement of serum FSH and E2 levels."
#9642,Acupuncture and transcutaneous stimulation analgesia in comparison with moderate-dose fentanyl anaesthesia in major surgery. Clinical efficacy and influence on recovery and morbidity,"The efficacy of acupuncture and transcutaneous stimulation analgesia, supplemented by small doses of fentanyl (mean 1.2 micrograms/kg, SD 1.7) was compared with moderate-dose fentanyl anaesthesia (mean 22.9 micrograms/kg, SD 2.8) in 29 patients who underwent surgery for retroperitoneal lymph node dissection. The present study describes the anaesthetic techniques and comparison of haemodynamics, demand for analgesics after surgery, recovery and blood gases, restoration of urinary and bowel functions, convalescence in terms of self-reliance and the postoperative course in respect of fatigue and morbidity. A more rapid return of consciousness, an absence of hypercapnia and a smaller decrease in pH were observed in patients who received acupuncture and transcutaneous stimulation (p less than 0.05). No clinically relevant disadvantages attributable to the method were demonstrated."
#9644,A standardized transcutaneous electric acupoint stimulation for relieving tobacco urges in dependent smokers,"The efficacy of acupuncture in smoking cessation, and its effect on the urge to smoke are unclear. We evaluated the effect of a standardized protocol of transcutaneous electric acupoint stimulations (TEAS) on alleviating the urge to smoke. Ninety-eight smokers were recruited in two double-blind studies. Participants abstained from smoking for 26 h, and were randomized to receive TEAS alternating between 2 and 100 Hz at four acupoints (LI4 and PC8, PC6 and TE5) at four different intensities (10, 5, Intermittent 5 or 0 mA). The urge to smoke was assessed by the Questionnaire of Smoking Urges (QSU-Brief). In Experiment 1, the 10 mA group (n = 20) was compared with the 5 mA group (n = 20); the increase in smoking urges did not differ significantly. Considering the possibility that 5 mA may be an active intervention, in Experiment 2, a true placebo (0 mA), and a proxy of placebo [Intermittent 5 mA (i5 mA)] were compared with 10 mA TEAS. In this experiment, 10 mA (n = 20) TEAS showed a tendency to alleviate smoking urges compared with 0 mA (n = 16), and i5 mA (n = 19) TEAS. Only when the data of smokers with Fagerstöm Test for Nicotine Dependence score ≥5 were analyzed that the difference between the 10 mA group and the control group (0 and i5 mA) became significant. Based on these preliminary findings, we conclude that TEAS applied on the skin may antagonize the increase in urge to smoke in abstinent-dependent smokers. It seems warranted to assess the efficacy of TEAS in smoking cessation clinical trials involving a larger population of dependent smokers."
#9693,Transcutaneous Electrical Stimulation of PC5 and PC6 Acupoints Modulates Autonomic Balance in Heart Transplant Patients: A Pilot Study,"The increased resting heart rate (HR) in heart transplant patients is associated with enhanced metabolic demand, the potential for fatigue, and lower quality of life. In the present study, we hypothesized that transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation (TEAS) could modulate autonomic balance and reduce resting HR in these patients. A single-arm clinical trial was conducted with patients aged > 18 years, at ambulatorial accompaniment after heart transplantation, who were submitted to a single TEAS (40 minutes at pericardium channel acupoints PC5 and PC6). The arterial blood pressure and RR interval were recorded from 20 minutes before to 20 minutes after TEAS. The RR intervals were used to calculate HR variability (HRV) and the sympathovagal index. Linear mixed models were used for comparing variables before, during, and after TEAS. The significance level was set as P < 0.05. TEAS acutely improved HRV in transplant patients and enhanced the sympathovagal index during its application. Significant increases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure and mean arterial pressure were observed at recovery, such as a slight, but significant, decrease in HR. In conclusion, TEAS at PC5 and PC6 acutely modulates HRV and hemodynamics in transplant patients."
#9753,Neuroscience education in addition to trigger point dry needling for the management of patients with mechanical chronic low back pain: A preliminary clinical trial,"The objective of the current study was to determine the short-term effects of trigger point dry needling (TrP-DN) alone or combined with neuroscience education on pain, disability, kinesiophobia and widespread pressure sensitivity in patients with mechanical low back pain (LBP). Twelve patients with LBP were randomly assigned to receive either TrP-DN (TrP-DN) or TrP-DN plus neuroscience education (TrP-DN + EDU). Pain intensity (Numerical Pain Rating Scale, 0-10), disability (Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire-RMQ-, Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Index-ODI), kinesiophobia (Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia-TSK), and pressure pain thresholds (PPT) over the C5-C6 zygapophyseal joint, transverse process of L3 vertebra, second metacarpal, and tibialis anterior muscle were collected at baseline and 1-week after the intervention. Patients treated with TrP-DN + EDU experienced a significantly greater reduction of kinesiophobia (P = 0.008) and greater increases in PPT over the transverse process of L3 (P = 0.049) than those patients treated only with TrP-DN. Both groups experienced similar decreases in pain, ODI and RMQ, and similar increases in PPT over the C5/C6 joint, second metacarpal, and tibialis anterior after the intervention (all, P > 0.05). The results suggest that TrP-DN was effective for improving pain, disability, kinesiophobia and widespread pressure sensitivity in patients with mechanical LBP at short-term. The inclusion of a neuroscience educational program resulted in a greater improvement in kinesiophobia."
#9761,A randomized controlled pilot study of the triple stimulation technique in the assessment of electroacupuncture for motor function recovery in patients with acute ischemic stroke,"The objective of this pilot study was to objectively assess electroacupuncture for motor function recovery in patients with acute ischemic stroke using the triple-stimulation technique (TST). The patients received either electroacupuncture plus western conventional medication (WCM) (n = 32) or single WCM (n = 31) for 14 days. The total clinical effective rate was statistically significantly superior in electroacupuncture group to that in WCM group (P < 0.01). Fugl-Meyer Assessment Scale (FMA) score, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, and TSTratio were statistically more significant in electroacupuncture group than those in WCM group (P < 0.01). There was positive correlation between TSTratio and NIHS score both before and after treatment (P < 0.01) and negative correlation between TSTratio and FAM score both before treatment and after treatment (P < 0.01). Comparing between the two groups or between pretreatment and posttreatment, adverse events, electrocardiogram, liver function, and kidney function showed no statistically significant difference (P > 0.05). In conclusion, electroacupuncture was beneficial for the motor function recovery of patients with acute ischemic stroke and was generally safe. TST can be used for quantitative evaluation of electroacupuncture for motor function recovery in patients with acute ischemic stroke because it can objectively analyze the injury and recovery of corticospinal tract impairments."
#9819,[Complementary medicine--the facts],"The popularity of complementary medicine in the western world continues to grow. Complementary medicine has a wide scope of topics including acupuncture, hypnosis, meditation, chiropractic manipulation, tai chi, yoga, botanical and herbal supplements and many other undefined modalities such as copper bracelets, magnets, holy water etc. For most modalities the mechanism of action is unknown and the evidence of benefit is poor. Some modalities such as acupuncture, hypnosis and tai chi may improve pain and other subjective complains. It seems that most of the beneficial effects of complementary medicine are placebo effects. Complementary treatment may be associated with side effects and should not be an alternative to the conventional medicine. Complementary medicine can be used as an adjunct to the conventional medicine and should be used in full agreement with and under the supervision of the attending physician. Patients should be informed about the existing evidence and what to expect from complementary medicine. Further meticulous research should be conducted to expand our knowledge in complementary medicine."
#9830,The Evaluation of Curative Effect of Acupuncture: A Review of Systematic and Meta-Analysis Studies,"The present study attempts to critically evaluate previously published research articles on the efficiency of acupuncture in the treatment of diseases. First, 35 systematic reviews or meta-analysis were found in the Cochrane database. Second, 54 related articles were selected by searching important scientific databases. Based on the results obtained regarding the efficacy of acupuncture for the treatment of various diseases, the articles were divided into 3 groups. The first group of articles confirmed the efficacy of treatment by acupuncture. In the second group of articles, the therapeutic effect of acupuncture was shown; however, further research is required to verify the results. In the third group of articles there is no evidence regarding the therapeutic effect of acupuncture till now. There is an urgent need to design and conduct double-blinded randomized clinical trials with high-quality methodologies. This provides a more careful evaluation of acupuncture efficiency in relation to the treatment of a vast array of diseases, based on scientific evidence."
#9954,Rehabilitation of the elderly patient with arthritis,"The rehabilitation of an elderly patient with arthritis involves a cooperative effort on the part of patients and their caregivers, therapists, and physicians. If treatment is begun early in the course of the disease, the onset of functional decline and disability may be delayed or prevented. It may be useful for patients to contact the American Arthritis Foundation for further information and referral to support groups. Older people with arthritis must be included at a societal decision-making level in helping plan, design, and monitor community projects where handicap access questions arise. A major problem for people with disability is often the barriers they encounter in the environment and the attitudes of society. Treatment goals should be discussed and agreed on, and education and psychologic support should be provided for patients and their families. Each case must be individually assessed and a set of tailor-made rehabilitation interventions prescribed. Rest, exercise (active or passive), joint splinting, massage, heat (moist or dry heat), cold, pharmacotherapy, joint injection, surgery, and complementary treatment modalities such as homeopathy, acupuncture, education, and psychosocial support all have their role in the rehabilitation of the elderly patient with arthritis. For most patients, the course and prognosis are excellent. In general strength, ROM, and joint function can be preserved or improved to the point that participation in normal activities of daily living is possible."
#9982,Nicotine dependence and secondary effects of smoking cessation,"The secondary effects of smoking cessation among subjects included in a randomized trial, performed to test the efficacy of acupuncture and nicotine chewing gum vs. the control group, are reported according to nicotine dependence. After 1 month of cessation, ex-smokers had modified their nutritional intake, had gained weight, and felt more irritable compared to subjects still smoking. After 1 year, secondary effects concerned greater weight gain and irritability. The percentage of subjects who presented these secondary effects was more frequent among high-dependent than among low-dependent ex-smokers."
#9985,The effects of linalool acupoint application therapy on sleep regulation,"The Shenque acupoint is located in the umbilicus of the human body. In the human body meridians, the Shenque acupoint can regulate body functions. The Shenque acupoint was one of the important acupuncture acupoints for the treatment of insomnia. However, the effect of linalool applied at the Shenque acupoint to improve sleep was unknown. This study explored the hypnotic and sedative effects of the main component of lavender, linalool, on the Shenque acupoint of mice and rats. The effects on the sleep latency and sleep duration were studied with the supra-threshold dose of pentobarbital sodium, and the effects on the sleep rate were studied with the sub-threshold dose of pentobarbital sodium. In order to further study the feasibility and superiority of linalool administered at the Shenque acupoint, a pharmacokinetic study was carried out. The pharmacodynamic results showed that the mice and rats treated with linalool at Shenque had the highest sleep rate, the shortest sleep latency, and the longest sleep duration compared with other groups. The T (max) and t (1/2) of the LS were longer than those of the LO, and had the characteristics of sustained release. The relative bioavailability of LS was 323.0 ± 31.66%. This showed that the combination of linalool and the Shenque acupoint had greater medicinal effects. This development will provide a new direction for improving sleep."
#9991,The two-dimensional shape of spatial interaction zones in the parafovea,"The spatial analysis of a target may be strongly degraded by the simultaneous presentation of nearby pattern elements. The present study investigated the shape and extent of the region of interaction as a function of retinal location. The stimuli consisted of 3 collinear [symbol: see text] s which were randomly oriented up ([symbol: see text]) or down ([symbol: see text]). The task was to discriminate the orientation of the middle [symbol: see text]. The retinal locations studied were at 0, 2.5, 5 and 10 degrees, on the lower vertical meridian and on the nasal halves of both the horizontal and the 45 degrees diagonal visual field meridians. The extent of the interaction region was defined as the separation between the midpoint of two adjacent [symbol: see text] s that resulted in 75% correct discrimination. The shape of the interaction region was determined by using several orientations (horizontal, vertical, left diagonal and right diagonal) for the virtual line joining the 3. [symbol: see text] s. Our results show that the size of the interaction regions varies linearly with eccentricity as does the size of a just resolved individual [symbol: see text]. However, the size of the interaction region varies much more rapidly than does the resolution threshold for an individual [symbol: see text]. The spatial interaction zones appear to be elongated radially, so that they have an elliptical shape. The size of the major axis is about 2-3 times the size of the minor axis. The major axis is along the meridian through the central visual field (i.e. it is oriented radially) while the minor axis is oriented tangentially (i.e. isoeccentrically)."
#10000,The stenopaeic slit: an analytical expression to quantify its optical effects in front of an astigmatic eye,"The stenopaeic slit is a trial case accessory used in subjective refraction, especially when high astigmatism is present. In spite of its simplicity, the effect of the slit when it is not oriented along one of the principal meridians of the examined eye is difficult to predict, even in terms of classical geometrical optics. In this paper, the optical principles of the slit are considered with full details in the theoretical framework of the dioptric power space. An analytical expression to obtain the residual refractive error when a stenopaeic slit is placed in front of an astigmatic eye at any orientation is deduced. In the light of these results, some aspects of the clinical procedure are discussed."
#10020,Complementary therapy for atopic dermatitis and other allergic skin diseases: facts and controversies,"The term complementary or alternative medicine encompasses numerous diverse therapeutic concepts, ranging from as herbal medicine, diet with essential fatty acids, and probiotics, to acupuncture. The main focus of these treatment methods is inflammatory skin disease, in particular atopic dermatitis. Although integrative medicine enjoys increasing popularity, particularly in industrialized countries, clinical studies that meet the double-blind, placebo-controlled standard are rare or nonexistent. The aim of this contribution is to provide the various concepts of integrative medicine."
#10034,The Effectiveness of Physiotherapy and Complementary Therapies on Voice Disorders: A Systematic Review of Randomized Controlled Trials,"The treatment of voice disorders includes physiotherapy and complementary therapies. However, research to support these treatments is scarce. OBJECTIVE: to verify the effectiveness of physiotherapy and complementary therapies on voice disorders. Research on electronic databases PubMed/Medline, SciELO, and LILACS was performed using the combination: voice AND (treatment OR intervention) according to PRISMA guidelines. Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included in the review. Studies were analyzed using the physiotherapy evidence database (PEDro) scale and the Center for Evidence-Based Medicine's Levels of Evidence scale. Eight papers met the inclusion criteria. From the RCTs included in this review, six assessed massage, one transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), one refer to spinal manipulative therapy, and one to acupuncture. The literature regarding the effectiveness of physiotherapy and complementary therapies was good in both quality and results, indicating that massage, TENS, and acupuncture seem to be effective treatments to reduce voice complaints and improve voice quality, supporting the inclusion of complementary therapies but mostly physiotherapy interventions in the treatment of patients with voice disorders."
#10106,[Advances in research of complementary and integrative medicine: a review of recent publications in some of the leading medical journals],"This article assesses the evidence for effectiveness, adverse effects and cost-effectiveness of complementary therapies, as reflected in publications in high impact factor medical journals during the years 2012-2014. The search detected 13 randomized controlled studies (RCTs) and 14 meta-analyses, which collectively assessed results of 191 RCTs involving the participation of several thousand patients. Pain was the major focus of acupuncture research in both clinical and fMRI studies, which demonstrated that the effect of acupuncture is beyond the placebo effect. In addition, RCTs supported the use of acupuncture as an adjunctive therapy in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and in moderate to severe depression. A promising trend was reported for the ameliorating effect of acupuncture in gout. Spinal manipulations may be helpful in cervical pain and yoga may be a useful treatment option for chronic neck pain, chronic low back pain and for pain-related disability. Beneficial effects of adding hypnosis and massage therapy to the treatment of fibromyalgia patients were also documented. Tai-chi may reduce balance impairment in mild-to-moderate Parkinson's disease and improve symptoms in patients with osteoarthritis. Products containing cranberry are associated with protective effects in some subgroups of patients with recurrent urinary tract infections. Chinese herbs may assist in glycemic control of diabetes patients and improve survival rate of patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Some of the complementary therapies were found to be cost-effective. Physicians should be aware of the possible adverse effects of these treatments and of possible drug-herb interactions. Further larger scale trials are justified."
#10119,Models for the study of whole systems,"This article summarizes a network and complex systems science model for research on whole systems of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) such as homeopathy and traditional Chinese medicine. The holistic concepts of networks and nonlinear dynamical complex systems are well matched to the global and interactive perspectives of whole systems of CAM, whereas the reductionistic science model is well matched to the isolated local organ, cell, and molecular mechanistic perspectives of pharmaceutically based biomedicine. Whole systems of CAM are not drugs with specific actions. The diagnostic and therapeutic approaches of whole systems of CAM produce effects that involve global and patterned shifts across multiple subsystems of the person as a whole. For homeopathy, several characteristics of complex systems, including the probabilistic nature of attractor patterns, variable sensitivity of complex systems to initial conditions, and emergent behaviors in the evolution of a system in its full environmental context over time, could help account for the mixed basic science and controlled clinical trial research findings, in contrast with the consistently positive outcomes of observational studies in the literature. Application of theories and methods from complex systems and network science can open a new era of advances in understanding factors that lead to good versus poor individual global outcome patterns and to rational triage of patients to one type of care over another. The growing reliance on complex systems thinking and systems biology for cancer research affords a unique opportunity to bridge between the CAM and conventional medical worlds with some common language and conceptual models."
#10126,Comparative effectiveness of traditional Chinese medicine and psychosocial care in the treatment of temporomandibular disorders-associated chronic facial pain,"This dual-site study sought to identify the appropriate role for traditional Chinese medicine (TCM; acupuncture and herbs) in conjunction with a validated psychosocial self-care (SC) intervention for treating chronic temporomandibular disorders (TMD)-associated pain. Participants with Research Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders-confirmed TMD (n = 168) entered a stepped-care protocol that began with a basic TMD class. At weeks 2 and 10, patients receiving SC whose worst facial pain was above predetermined levels were reallocated by minimization to SC or TCM with experienced practitioners. Characteristic facial pain (CFP: mean of worst pain, average pain when having pain, and current pain; each visual analog scale [VAS] 0-10) was the primary outcome. Social activity interference (VAS 0-10) was a secondary outcome. Patients were monitored for safety. TCM provided significantly greater short-term (8-week) relief than SC (CFP reduction difference, -.60 [standard deviation of the estimate .26], P = .020) and greater reduction in interference with social activities (-.81 [standard deviation of the estimate .33], P = .016). In 2 of 5 treatment trajectory groups, more than two thirds of participants demonstrated clinically meaningful responses (≥30% improvement) in pain interference over 16 weeks. This study provides evidence that TMD patients referred for TCM in a community-based model will receive safe treatment that is likely to provide some short-term pain relief and improved quality of life. Similar designs may also apply to evaluations of other kinds of chronic pain. (ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT00856167). PERSPECTIVE: This short-term comparative effectiveness study of chronic facial pain suggests that TCM is safe and frequently efficacious alone or subsequent to standard psychosocial interventions. TCM is widely available throughout North America and may provide clinicians and patients with a reasonable addition or alternative to other forms of therapy."
#10153,[Effect of acupuncture on interleukin-2 level and NK cell immunoactivity of peripheral blood of malignant tumor patients],"This paper deals with the observation of acupuncture therapy affecting interleukin-2(IL-2 level and natural killer (NK) cell immunoactivity in the peripheral blood of patients with malignant tumors. In this clinical-laboratory test research, randomized double blind method was used. The patients were divided into an acupuncture treated group (n = 25) and a control group (n = 20). The former group was treated using points, ST36,LI11,RN6 and locations of symptomatic points bilaterally. They received one treatment of 30 minutes daily for 10 days. The results showed that the IL-2 level and NK cell activity were lower than normal in patients with malignant tumor, but there was an increase in the acupuncture group after 10 days of treatment. Significance was found to be remarkable (P < 0.01). The difference between the two groups was also significant (P < 0.01). This increase might be related to the mechanism of acupuncture that adjusting the body's immune function. Thus, acupuncture therapy could enhance the cellular immune function of patients with malignant tumors and providing a beneficial effect in anti-cancer treatment."
#10179,A randomized trial of transcutaneous electric acupoint stimulation as adjunctive treatment for opioid detoxification,"This pilot study tested the effectiveness of transcutaneous electric acupoint stimulation (TEAS) as an adjunctive treatment for inpatients receiving opioid detoxification with buprenorphine-naloxone at a private psychiatric hospital. Participants (N = 48) were randomly assigned to active or sham TEAS and received three 30-minute treatments daily for 3 to 4 days. In active TEAS, current was set to maximal tolerable intensity (8-15 mA); in sham TEAS, it was set to 1 mA. By 2 weeks postdischarge, participants in active TEAS were less likely to have used any drugs (35% vs. 77%, p < .05). They also reported greater improvements in pain interference (F = 4.52, p < .05) and physical health (F = 4.84, p < .01) over time. TEAS is an acceptable, inexpensive adjunctive treatment that is feasible to implement on an inpatient unit and may be a beneficial adjunct to pharmacological treatments for opioid detoxification."
#10205,Acupotomy combined with intra-articular injection of sodium hyaluronate in the treatment of knee osteoarthritis,"This retrospective study aimed to compare the effects of acupotomy combined with intra-articular injection of sodium hyaluronate (IA-SH) for the treatment of knee osteoarthritis (KOA). Eighty electronic medical records of patients with KOA were retrospectively analyzed. The patients were divided into an intervention group (n = 40, acupotomy plus IA-SH) and a control group (n = 40, IA-SH). Outcome measures included the visual analog scale, the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC), and adverse events. Outcome data were collected and analyzed before and after treatment. The results of this study showed that there was a greater reduction in the visual analog scale (P < .01) and WOMAC scores (pain, P < .01; stiffness, P < .01; function, P < .01; total, P < .01) in the intervention group than in the control group. In addition, there were no significant differences in adverse events between the 2 groups. In this study, the effects of acupotomy plus IA-SH were superior to those of IA-SH alone for the treatment of patients with KOA. Further prospective studies are required to confirm these findings."
#10264,Combining fire needle plus cupping with famciclovir and gabapentin in the treatment of acute herpes zoster: a revised intervention approach,"This study aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of fire needle plus cupping (FC) combined with oral famciclovir and gabapentin for the treatment of acute-phase herpes zoster (AHZ). This study was conducted as a superiority, randomized controlled trial in which 84 patients with AHZ who met the diagnostic criteria were selected and randomly assigned to three groups on a 1:1 basis. Group A: received oral famciclovir with gabapentin treatment (FG); Group B: received fire needle plus cupping (FC) with FG. The primary outcome was the difference in patients' pain levels as assessed by the VAS scale. Secondary outcomes were changes in sign-symptom scores, incidence of adverse effects, and incidence of PHN. After one week of treatment, both groups showed decreased VAS scores and symptom-sign scores compared to baseline. However, the decrease in VAS scores was significantly higher in Group B compared to Group A (p < 0.0001). Similarly, the improvement in symptom-sign scores was significantly better in Group B (p < 0.0001). Group A experienced a higher rate of adverse reactions (21.95%) compared to Group B (4.76%), with a significant difference between the groups (p = 0.021). Furthermore, the incidence of PHN was significantly lower in Group B (4.76%) compared to Group A (29.27%) (p = 0.003). Fire needle therapy combined with medication demonstrated superior analgesic effects, improved symptom relief, and reduced adverse reactions and the incidence of PHN compared to medication alone in the treatment of AHZ. Importantly, the fire needle and cupping therapy should be considered an add-on therapy to standard drug treatment, rather than a standalone treatment. Additionally, due to the lack of a sham-treated control group, the placebo effect associated with invasive therapies such as fire needling and cupping. Future studies should include a sham control group to better isolate the true effects of the treatment. Clinical trial registration: This study was registered with the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry under the code ChiCTR1800015372 ( https://www.chictr.org.cn ). Registered on 28 March 2018. All experiments on the participants were following the Declaration of Helsinki."
#10266,"Effect of Combined Bee Venom Acupuncture and NSAID Treatment for Non-Specific Chronic Neck Pain: A Randomized, Assessor-Blinded, Pilot Clinical Trial","This study aimed to investigate the feasibility of a combined treatment of bee venom acupuncture (BVA) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for the treatment of non-specific chronic neck pain (NCNP). Patients with NCNP for ≥3 months were randomly allocated to a BVA, NSAIDs, or combined group (1:1:1), receiving 6 sessions of BVA, loxoprofen (180 mg daily), or a combination, respectively, for 3 weeks. Recruitment, adherence, and completion rates were calculated to assess feasibility. Bothersomeness, pain, disability, quality of life, depressive status, treatment credibility, and adverse events were assessed. In total, 60 participants were enrolled, and 54 completed the trial. Recruitment, adherence, and completion rates were 100%, 95%, and 90%, respectively. Bothersomeness, pain, disability, and depressive symptoms significantly improved in all groups after treatment (p < 0.05). The combined group showed continuous improvement during the follow-up period (p < 0.05). Quality of life was significantly improved (p < 0.05), and treatment credibility was maintained in the BVA and combined groups. No serious adverse events were reported. Combined treatment of BVA and NSAIDs are feasible for the treatment of NCNP, showing high persistence of the effect, credibility, and safety. Additional trials with longer follow-up are needed to confirm this effect."
#10274,Quality of reporting and its correlates among randomized controlled trials on acupuncture for cancer pain: application of the CONSORT 2010 Statement and STRICTA,"This study aims to analyze the quality of reporting and its correlates in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on acupuncture for cancer pain. Quality of reporting for included papers was assessed against a subset of criteria adapted from the CONSORT 2010 statement and STRICTA. An overall quality score (OQS) and a combined key methodologic index score (MIS) was calculated for each trial. Factors associated with OQS and MIS were then identified. A total of 32 RCTs were included in the full text. The median OQS based on the CONSORT Statement and STRICTA was 4.0 and 0, respectively. The significant predictors for CONSORT OQS were year of publication and nationality of authors, for STRICTA it was nationality of authors and for MIS it was publication language. The quality of reporting in RCTs on acupuncture for cancer pain was poor. This indicates that RCTs on acupuncture for cancer pain need substantial improvement."
#10279,"Effects of warming needle moxibustion on postoperative rehabilitation, pain degree, immune function, and upper limb lymphedema in patients with breast cancer undergoing radical mastectomy","This study aims to evaluate the effects of warm acupuncture combined with conventional functional rehabilitation training (FRT) on the recovery of breast cancer (BC) patients following radical mastectomy, focusing on immune function, pain management, and quality of life (QoL). This retrospective study involved 118 BC patients who underwent radical surgery at the Second People's Hospital Affiliated to Fujian University of Chinese Medicine between January 2022 and May 2024. The included patient were assigned into an experimental group (EG, n=62, warm acupuncture in conjunction with conventional FRT) and a control group (CG; n=56; conventional FRT only). Postoperative outcomes, including surgery duration, intraoperative blood loss (IOBL), drainage volume (DV), length of hospital stay, upper limb mobility, immune function indicators, and pain scores, were compared between the two groups. Multivariate logistic regression was employed to identify factors affecting treatment outcomes. The EG demonstrated significantly lower visual analog scale (VAS) scores at post-operative 2, 4, and 8 weeks compared to the CG (all P < 0.05). The incidence of upper limb lymphedema in the EG was 9.26%, notably lower than the 24.07% observed in the CG (P < 0.05). Immune function indicators, including CD3(+), CD4(+), CD8(+), and the CD4(+)/CD8(+) ratio, were significantly higher in the EG postoperatively (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the EG reported significantly improved scores in role physical, general health, vitality, social functioning, role emotional, mental health, and physiological functioning, alongside significantly lower scores in bodily pain compared to the CG (all P < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed CD3(+) and CD4(+)/CD8(+) ratio as independent factors affecting patient treatment efficacy (both P < 0.05). In conclusion, the combination of warm acupuncture and conventional FRT significantly enhances immune function, pain management, and overall QoL in BC patients after surgery, with CD3(+) and CD4(+)/CD8(+) ratios being crucial factors influencing recovery."
#10417,To evaluate the effects of artificial tears on ocular biological parameters in dry eye and non-dry eye patients,"To analyze the changes in ocular biometry readings in patients with dry eye (DE) and non-dry eye (NDE) after instilling artificial tear drop (ATD). A prospective study was conducted on 98 eyes of 98 patients (DE group, n = 54 eyes; NDE group, n = 44 eyes) who underwent ocular biometry with four consecutive measurements using the IOL Master 700. The baseline flat meridian of the anterior corneal surface (K1), steep meridian of the anterior corneal surface (K2), corneal curvature radius(R1, R2), axial length (AL), anterior chamber depth (ACD), central corneal thickness (CCT), white-to-white corneal diameter (WTW), pupil diameter, non-invasive tear break-up time (NITBUT) and tear meniscus height, (TMH) was measured at baseline, 30-s, 2-min, and 5-min intervals after instilling one drop of ATD. Variability in biometry measurements was assessed and compared. The mean age of the NDE group and DE group was 27.09 ± 10.21 years (30 females, 68.18%) and 29.96 ± 12.08 years (38 females, 70.37%), respectively. Following the application of ATD, intergroup comparisons revealed significant changes in K1 at 2 min and 5 min (p = 0.043, p = 0.043, and p = 0.038, respectively), and significant changes in R1 and R2 at 2 min. Intragroup comparisons showed that AL exhibited significant changes at 30 s (p < 0.001), while CCT demonstrated significant alterations across all time points (p < 0.001). Changes in ACD were observed at 30 s and 2 min in the dry eye group, and pupil diameter showed significant changes at 2 min in both the DE and NDE groups. No significant changes were detected in WTW at any point (all p > 0.05). Artificial tears significantly affect the readings of AL and CCT during ocular biometry. It is recommended to wait for at least 5 min after the installation of eye drops before performing ocular biometry measurements."
#10419,[Cardiologists' perceptions on Behcet's disease and its cardiovascular lesions: a single center analysis],"To analyze the perceptions of cardiovascular specialists about Behcet's disease and its cardiovascular lesions in Beijing Anzhen Hospital, Capital Medical University. A survey using questionnaires was conducted among cardiovascular specialists in the hospital, the differences among groups were analyzed with χ(2) analyses. Less than half of the cardiovascular specialists were familiar with the diagnostic criteria of Behcet's disease (32.6%), and its skin lesions, as acne-like rash (41.3%), erythema nodosum (42.0%), acupuncture response (47.8%). The knowledge of its cardiovascular lesions was too superficial, especially in the awareness of heart conduction block. Most of the specialists preferred to use low dose of glucocorticoids before operation in their practice. To improve the knowledge and awareness of Behcet's disease and its cardiovascular lesions is of great significance for the early diagnosis, improvement of prognosis, and reduction of postoperative complications."
#10436,Comparison of organ cultured precut corneas versus surgeon-cut corneas for Descemet's stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty,"To compare precut and surgeon-cut organ cultured donor corneas for DSAEK. A total of 119 consecutive eyes treated with DSAEK were retrospectically identified. 65 grafts were cut by the surgeon (Moria, ALTK System) prior to DSAEK and 54 grafts were precut by laboratory technicians from the Danish Eye Bank (Horizon single-use system). 1 year after surgery, tomographic images were obtained with the Pentacam HR. Endothelial cell density (ECD) and best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was determined. Graft thickness and graft asymmetry was evaluated in the centre and 1 mm from the edge of the graft in 6 semi-meridians. 1 year after surgery, the ECD loss was similar in the two groups, averaging 25.9 ± 14 % in surgeon-cut, and 22.9 ± 17 % in precut group (p = 0.33). Mean central graft thickness was 172 ± 6 μm in surgeon-cut grafts and 182 ± 6 μm in precut grafts (p = 0.30). BCVA was similar in surgeon-cut and precut corneas; being 0.25 ± 0.02 logMAR and 0.24 ± 0.02 logMAR, respectively (p = 0.59). The graft asymmetry index was 1.48 ± 0.02 for surgeon-cut and 1.44 ± 0.02 for precut grafts. There were no significant differences in complications rate in both groups. No correlations between BCVA and central graft thickness or graft asymmetry index in both groups were observed. Organ cultured precut donor corneas are comparable with surgeon-cut grafts with respect to ECD, graft thickness and asymmetry, and postoperative complication rate."
#10452,Complementary and alternative medicine for chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome,"To discuss challenges concerning treatment for chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) and review complementary and alternative medical (CAM) therapies being evaluated for this condition, we performed a comprehensive search of articles published from 1990-2005 using the PubMed, Medline databases. Data from the articles were abstracted and pooled by subject. Keywords cross-searched with CP/CPPS included: complementary, alternative, integrative, therapies, interventions, nutrition, antioxidants, herbs, supplements, biofeedback and acupuncture. Listed articles with no abstracts were not included. Various CAM therapies for CP/CPPS exist including biofeedback, acupuncture, hyperthermia and electrostimulation. Additionally, a variety of in vitro and in vivo studies testing herbal and nutritional supplements were found. Saw palmetto, cernilton and quercetin were the most frequently tested supplements for CP/CPPS. Although many CAM therapies demonstrate positive preliminary observations as prospective treatments for CP/CPPS, further exploratory studies including more randomized, controlled trials are necessary for significant validation as treatment options for this complex disorder."
#10476,Traditional Chinese medicine in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee,"To evaluate whether the use of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM; zhōng yī) influences symptoms or functional outcomes in patients with osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee ( xī guān jié yán). A systematic review of randomized control trials was conducted. Searches for studies in PubMed that were performed between 1965 and August 2013, and retrieved studies were subjected to reference screening. The types of studies included in our review were 1) placebo-based or comparative studies; 2) open label, single-blinded or double-blinded studies; 3) studies evaluating the efficacy of TCM for treating OA of the knee; and 4) studies evaluating only TCM or combination preparations. Trials were conducted with participants over 18 years of age with knee pain and at least three of the following characteristics: 1) an age greater than 50 years; 2) morning stiffness lasting for fewer than 30 min; 3) a crackling or grating sensation; 4) bony tenderness of the knee; 5) bony enlargement of the knee; or 6) no detectable warmth of the joint to the touch. Studies were rated for risk of bias and graded for quality. After screening, 104 studies that satisfied the eligibility requirements were identified, and only 18 randomized control trials were included in the quantitative and qualitative synthesis. Upon review, we found ""moderate-quality"" evidence of effects from acupuncture ( zhēn jiǔ) on pain, which was measured using a visual analogue scale, and physical function, which was measured using qigong ( qì gōng) with motion. ""Low-quality"" evidence was found regarding the effects of acupuncture on physical function, and no evidence was found regarding the effects of herbal medicine on pain or physical function. Herbal patches ( yào bù) appeared to affect pain and physical and function, but these effects were not found to be significant. The initial findings included in this review suggest that acupuncture is a promising intervention according to the primary outcome measure, pain, and qigong with motion is an effective method for treating physical function. However, according to the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation criteria, only moderate-quality evidence was found in these studies. Further rigorous studies are warranted to investigate the application of TCM in treating OA of knee."
#10531,Scalp Acupuncture Attenuates Brain Damage After Intracerebral Hemorrhage Through Enhanced Mitophagy and Reduced Apoptosis in Rats,"To study the effect of scalp acupuncture (SA) on the mitophagy signaling pathway in the caudate nucleus of Sprague-Dawley rats following intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). An ICH model was established by injecting autologous arterial blood into the caudate nucleus in 200 male Sprague-Dawley rats, which were divided into five groups: sham, ICH, 3-methyladenine group (3-MA, 30 mg/kg), SA, and SA+3-MA. Animals were analyzed at 6 and 24 h as well as at 3 and 7 days. Composite neurological scale score was significantly higher in the SA group than in the ICH group. Transmission electron microscopy showed less structural damage and more autophagic vacuoles within brain in the SA group than in the ICH group. SA group showed higher levels of Beclin1, Parkin, PINK1, NIX protein, and a lower level of Caspase-9 in brain tissue. These animals consequently showed less neural cell apoptosis. Compared with the SA group, however, the neural function score and levels of mitophagy protein in the SA+3-MA group were decreased, neural cell apoptosis was increased with more severe structural damage, which suggested that 3-MA may antagonize the protective effect of SA on brain in rats with ICH. SA may mitigate the neurologic impairment after ICH by enhancing mitophagy and reducing apoptosis."
#10628,Corneal topographic analysis of superolateral incision cataract surgery,"Using corneal topography, we compared the corneal shape changes following superolateral incision cataract surgery with those following conventional superior incision surgery. In our superolateral incision procedure, a 6.5 mm limbal incision was made from the 9 o'clock to 11 o'clock meridians to avoid incising the superior limbus. One hundred four patients were divided into two groups; Group 1 comprised 66 patients who had surgery using the superolateral approach; Group 2 comprised 38 patients who had surgery using the superior approach. The corneas were examined by keratometer and topographic modeling system preoperatively, and at one week and one, three, and six months postoperatively. Keratometric measurements showed that surgically induced astigmatism (SIA) in Group 1 was significantly less than that in Group 2 throughout the six-month observation. The standard SIA deviation in Group 1 was also smaller than that in Group 2, indicating a smaller degree of variability in the superolateral incision surgery. In the corneal topographic analysis, a color-coded map averaging all the Group 1 corneas at each interval showed a slight steepening in the central cornea in the 10 o'clock meridian one week after surgery. This surgically induced steepening disappeared by one month, and the corneal shape recovered its preoperative shape. In contrast, the Group 2 averaged map showed a marked steepening of the upper and lower corneas. The steepening gradually decreased but remained until three months after surgery. Superolateral incision surgery induced a smaller degree of change in the corneal shape, as well as in SIA, than superior incision surgery. The postoperative corneal shape changes disappeared rapidly after the superolateral incision, and the corneal shape soon stabilized and recovered its preoperative shape."
#10645,Violet laser acupuncture - Part 5: An investigation of different stimulation frequencies on heart rate and variability,"Violet laser acupuncture was recently described by our research group. Neurochemical studies of acupuncture analgesia revealed that 2- and 100-Hz peripheral stimulation induce differential peptide release from preproenkephalin and preprodynorphin via different neural pathways. The goal of the fifth part of this series was to perform a pilot investigation on the effects of 2- and 100-Hz violet laser acupuncture on heart rate (HR) and its variability (HRV) in 13 healthy volunteers (mean age ± standard deviation: 23.9 ± 1.7 years) using a new non-invasive method. We found a significant difference in mean HR before, during, and after 2- or 100-Hz violet laser acupuncture, and there was a significant difference of the low frequency/ high frequency ratio before, during, and after 2- or 100-Hz violet laser acupuncture. However, we did not observe a significant difference in total HRV before, during, or after treatment. Further studies should be carried out to compare the effects of different violet laser acupuncture frequencies."
#10655,Assessing the effects of acupuncture by comparing needling the hegu acupoint and needling nearby nonacupoints by spectral analysis of microcirculatory laser Doppler signals,"We aimed to assess the effects of acupuncture by analyzing the frequency content of skin blood-flow signals simultaneously recorded at the Hegu acupoint and two nearby nonacupoints following acupuncture stimulation (AS). Laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) signals were measured in male healthy volunteers in two groups of experiments: needling the Hegu acupoint (n = 13) and needling a nearby nonacupoint (control experiment; n = 10). Each experiment involved recording a 20 min baseline-data sequence and two sets of effects data recorded 0-20 and 50-70 min after stopping AS. Wavelet transform with Morlet mother wavelet was applied to the measured LDF signals. Needling the Hegu acupoint significantly increased the blood flow, significantly decreased the relative energy contribution at 0.02-0.06 Hz and significantly increased the relative energy contribution at 0.4-1.6 Hz at Hegu, but induced no significant changes at the nonacupoints. Also, needling a nearby nonacupoint had no effect in any band at any site. This is the first time that spectral analysis has been used to investigate the microcirculatory blood-flow responses induced by AS, and has revealed possible differences in sympathetic nerve activities between needling the Hegu acupoint and its nearby nonacupoint. One possible weakness of the present design is that different De-Qi feelings following AS could lead to nonblind experimental setup, which may bias the comparison between needling Hegu and its nearby nonacupoint. Our results suggest that the described noninvasive method can be used to evaluate sympathetic control of peripheral vascular activity, which might be useful for studying the therapeutic effects of AS."
#10674,Acupuncture for the treatment of cocaine addiction. Investigation of a needle puncture control,"We conducted a 6-week, single-blind study of acupuncture for cocaine dependence in methadone-maintained patients (N = 40) for the purpose of identifying an appropriate needle puncture control for use in future large-scale clinical trials. Patients were randomly assigned to receive daily acupuncture in three auricular sites plus one body site (LI-4), or in control sites within 2-3 mm of the four active sites. Overall, there was a positive response to treatment on a variety of drug-related and psychosocial measures. Cocaine use decreased significantly for patients in both needle puncture groups. The only statistically significant difference between the two types of needle puncture was on ratings of craving. Subjects rated each type of needle puncture as equally credible and perceived no significant differences on the acute effects of the two types of needle insertions. Power calculations based on these findings suggest that very large sample sizes would be required to detect treatment differences between this control condition and active acupuncture. Alternative controls are suggested, and the challenges inherent in implementing controlled clinical trials of acupuncture are discussed."
#10711,[Clinical and experimental studies on preventing and treating anaphylactic asthma with Zusanli point immunotherapy],"We have studied on preventing and treating anaphylactic asthma with Zusanli (S36) point immunotherapy (ZPIT). Sixty-nine patients were observed. The results showed that the clinical curative effect of ZPIT was not only much higher than that of conventional desensitization therapy, but also the patients' total IgE level was reduced, anti-acarid IgE was lowered, SIgA level was raised, the absolute eosinophilic granulocyte level dropped and pulmonary function recovered. Animal experiment results showed that the ZPIT could more effectively suppress the guinea pigs' anaphylactic asthma allergized by albumin and more obviously resist the guinea pigs' bronchial spasm induced by histamine and acetylcholine than the conventional desensitization therapy and injected normal saline. The immunomodulating action of the ZPIT are elucidated from clinical study and animal experiment in the paper."
